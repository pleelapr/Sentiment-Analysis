According to official statements, Stadia will be in the US, Canada and much of Europe at the beginning and already activate launch flows in the built-in 4K resolution and 60FPS. A correspondingly strong Internet connection, of course. But how deep must players go to a Stage subscription? Cheaper than PlayStation Now? While Google is silent on this topic, IDC market analyst Lewis Ward claims the price is for a monthly subscription will be around $ 1 5. As a result, Stadia's bottom line would be lower than Sony Interactive Entertainment's PlayStation Now service. In addition, Ward points out that Google would need to provide a similar gaming service if the company could hold itself against the well-known and above all established competition. Related Topics: Google Stages: High Requirements for Internet Connection and Still Input Layers over 160ms and Artifacts in Image ""PlayStation Now Offered for $ 20 per Month. Sometimes, however, they offer discounts of up to $ 10 per month They need to make certain assumptions about customization, infrastructure costs and development studies willing to pay per user or per minute for use to develop a profitable and growing Stage scenario, Warden says.

What a bunch of cheap asses. 
They can‚Äôt round that up to 10 or something? 
Those digital vouchers become meaningless come April 1. 
They would have done better to liquidate their entire inventory before it‚Äôs too late.

Anyway I guess it‚Äôs better than what other retailers are doing: absolutely nothing. 
There‚Äôs a delisted PS3 game code that I want from GameStop but of course they‚Äôre not smart enough to discount all their remaining digital codes before they‚Äôre deemed obsolete next week. 
Now I have to fork over $15 for something I probably won‚Äôt play anyway, but might never get the chance to again (unless they put it on PS Now or something).

Anyway, I think we‚Äôre all in need of some good news from this State of Play broadcast in a couple of hours, considering all the ways they‚Äôve been screwing over the consumers lately.

Just got a PS4. 
Mostly to play exclusives. 
Any suggestions beyond the obvious? 
Already targeting GOW, Spider-Man, blood Bourne, uncharted games (start at 1?) and nioh(?). 
Thanks for any ideas

Starting with UC1 is a MUST. 
The stories all connect, and there's great development in their characters and friendships as the games go on. 
The ending for UC4 made it all worth it.

Spidey will take you a while if you like doing side missions and other tasks. 
Great variety of challenges. 
Plus J.J.'s paranoia podcasts are hysterical listening to him blow a gasket when you accomplish a goal. 
Unlocking a gargantuan amount of suits and abilities will have you taking down entire groups in seconds 20-30 hours in, which is so satisfying watching Pete's ballet of punches, webs, flips and fist combos.

Fun fact: Rigby's voice from Regular Show does Otto Octavius's voice--but you'd never know it listening to him!

So that leaves what exactly? 
Most games people stream are fps and such which usually get m ratings and then the average rpg doesn't let you stream these days either. 
Stupid tales of berseria only let you stream on the monster isles -_-

Concrete Genie looks OK. 
I think I'm playing the waiting game on Day's Gone. 
Keeps looking a bit more generic every time more gameplay is revealed. 
This was not my type of direct, but I also don't own PSVR.

I picked up Emerald Shores (gotta support a fellow CAG) and Song of the Deep. 
Still thinking about getting Dirt 4 and will be picking up my pre-order of MLB The Show 19 MVP Edition at GS soon.

Can Kaz and House please come out of retirement? 
Ryan and Layden are really making some poor decisions over there.

Side note on Emerald Shores, the game made by fellow CAG Josh1billion. 
I got the platinum last night, and the game is actually quite fun, definitely much better than the 4/10 review score CornShack gave it. 
Going for the low level run trophy, I attempted the final boss at level 6 and couldn't get it done. 
Luckily, this was on my 3rd play through so I hadn't done some of the side levels yet and was able to go and level to 7 which was just enough to beat him. 
Side note, 1-3 is super frustrating and might be the hardest level in the game.

Regarding level 1-3: yeah, I totally dropped the ball on the difficulty ramp there - that level's been the hardest one for pretty much everybody. 
I even patched it after release just to make it easier (removing a bunch of spikes, etc.), but it's still a major pain compared to the levels that come after it.

Struggling to get back into something fun. 
Anyone know if anything particularly Tactical worth getting on sale? 
Is blood bowl 2 any good? 
Anything with some sort of base building? 
Not really sure what I want.

The final episode of The Walking Dead/last Telltale game ever came out today. 
I won't say much except it's an emotionally satisfying and fulfilling end to the series (I played it twice doing opposite actions; it seems there is only one canon ending). 
I'm glad Skybound stepped in to help them finish it; it wouldn't have been the same without a proper finale and swansong.

DXR being a non-proprietary implementation of real-time ray-tracing through I think DX12. 
Their RTX cards (ie those with tensor cores) will still be able to use their proprietary RT... tech? 
hardware? 
whatever... to do ray-tracing, maybe in conjunction with or instead of through DXR.

Here's an example of DXR (IIRC) being integrated into CryEngine. 
They render this video using a Vega 56.

I'm curious, but cautious. 
I checked with Speedtest and I should be good to go (72 Mbps down, 12ms ping). 
I'm also hearing you need Chromecast to play on a TV, and that's baked into the Shield TV I already own. 
But Stadia sounds a lot like PS Now and GeForce Now, neither of which have exactly wowed me. 
Just local streaming from my desktop to either the Shield or a Steam Link is janky as all get out.

Not pay for their service? Not an option in many areas of the world due to a few companies running the show on way too large of an area. Even in countries outside of the US. Canada and parts of the EU have this problem as well. Complain to them? You can only contact underpaid CS employees. They can't do anything, nor do they deserve you bitching to them. I guess you can complain on Reddit. Historically, ISPs have had pressure on them for years. With the rise of Netflix and other video streaming services, load on tier 1 infra ranging from serviceable to abysmal increased exponentially. ISPs dealt with this by shaping traffic where it was legal, and flat out ignoring the problem where it wasn't. Google launching some game streaming service isn't going to pressure much, YouTube already runs into this problem and is probably the largest video streaming site in the world. ISPs don't care because nothing makes them. Hell, you're assuming this is going to be successful when Onlive failed, Geforce NOW failed, PS Now is meh. And Google, the company that is the king of poorly supporting their products when non-tech related logistics gets hard (hi, publishers), is going to do better? ehhhhh.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b2zhhy/google_gdc_2019_gaming_announcement_live_stream/eix7j7l/#5320f5e24.eix7j7l","0","0","","","0","242069629520","","false","","","","","","reply","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/b2zhhy/google_gdc_2019_gaming_announcement_live_stream/","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-20T00:22:01.899+0000","","0.0","4971"

It really won't kill everything else, even with great servers there's still an inherent latency with systems like that that make some games difficult, and its extremely sensitive to network quality because it can't buffer much or that will add even more latency. 1080p (or 4k) 60 fps real time gameplay also will use significantly more bandwidth than 1080p 60 fps youtube or netflix because the next frame isn't predictable or set in stone so it can't be compressed by only storing the changes in between frames like traditional video. Google is in a unique position to have the server locations and network capacity to deliver a smooth experience though.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/b32el0/gaming_companies_and_their_best_exclusives/eix7fap/#4c0656395.eix7fap","0","0","","","0","242069525582","","false","","","","","","reply","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/b32el0/gaming_companies_and_their_best_exclusives/","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-20T00:20:43.940+0000","","0.0","4971"

For those of us were born in the 80s and early 90s you might remember when you went to a different area code you had different channels and a different provider. Since Comcast and Time Warner bought up all these smaller companies and Comcast is essentially paying off these local governments we now have a monopoly. The problem is when Google decides or anyone else with a better cheaper or same price cable product for cheap and fast internet they need permission which is never granted to operate. The problem is we have very slow internet speeds in the United States. As much as Sony bet on streaming they completely failed as PlayStation now requires a connection most Americans don‚Äôt have.

Is this a joke? The software hasn't matured and isn't at all ready for iOS yet, it's not on Android either? Last I saw Project XCloud hadn't even launched. >I know you're a huge PS4 fanboy so you'll probably try to pretend it's not true, but PS Now is a joke compared to Gamepass Haha, I love the hypocrisy when your post history is just Xbox fanboyism. Feel free to look into mine where I talk about PC, Xbox, Switch & PS without being a fanboy. Both very early iterations of software, the Game Pass library is 10x better because MS has put a big focus on it, PS Now will likewise grow over time. PS Now does need a companion, that's my whole point? People will be inclined to buy a PS because of exclusive titles and therefore own the companion, therefore sub to PS Now instead of Game Pass/XCloud. People won't be inclined to buy Xbox hardware because MS is releasing all of their titles on PC therefore won't own the companion, so why use their service when you can use a competitor one that links into your PC/PS ecosystem? Talking about mental gymnastics and narratives you're literally doing free PR for MS, it's actually exceptionally sad.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/b0d39d/halo_mcc_coming_to_pc/eie810n/#55895dd74.eie810n","0","0","","","0","240665052031","","false","","","","","","reply","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/b0d39d/halo_mcc_coming_to_pc/","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-13T00:27:04.977+0000","","0.0","4971"

You can either wait until your sub expires, or try your luck with chat support. In my case, the latter was met with frustration since I got a rep and supervisor who were so dumb I am surprised they could even coordinate breathing and walking.

When I then booted up my PS4 and went to the store to download the game it only gave me the option to re-buy it, also the download I had from PS Now was locked and giving me a ""Cannot use the content. Your PlayStation Now license cannot be confirmed. Check your license in PlayStation Store."" \[verbatim\] ‚Äã ‚Äã I Purchased Now early last week, and bought the game on Friday. I spoke with 2 separate online support agents friday each having me do various steps none of which fixed the issue. I figured I'd wait the weekend since I had work and would see if it fixed by chance. No change, so I contacted support again today and after some more steps was told essentially that there is nothing they can do and I will have to wait for my PS Now access to drop for it to allow me to download the purchased game and play. ‚Äã ‚Äã The only other option they provided would be cancel and refund the purchased game. Which since I the sale is only going till tomorrow would mean I would just re-purchase the game and be right back in the same boat. Like I said not sure if it is a known issue, or been posted 1000 times before. Just wanted to maybe help others since I feel cheated out of $40 in the end.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationNow/comments/axg6yn/issue_buying_a_game_after_playing_it_on_ps_now/#595d69bd0.axg6yn","0","0","","","0","239101921007","","false","","","","","","post","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-05T03:01:47.955+0000","","0.0","4971"

More than two years after Shield 2017 came out. 
Sure, same specs as SHield 2015, but at least it was an update. 
Released Feb 2017. 
Since we're March 2019 now, and not a peep about an update from Nvidia - what is a reasonable man to conclude? 
That there won't be any further updates, of course. 
Nvidia is axing the Shield TV, just like the Shield Portable and Shield Tablet before. 
But why? 
What went wrong? 
The following is my, partly-informed, speculation. 
I have a buddy who works for Nvidia in SanFran, and he heard things through the grapewine. 
Doesn't mean they are 100% true, but you never know. 
Back in 2015, the first Shield comes out and it is amazing! 
Hardware to die for! 
Not just the most powerful Android TV box at the time (and still is 4 years later), but also a mini-console on its own merit, with a slew of ""exclusive"" games (android-based), and a Gamestream for PC Gamers (master race :), who would like to play on their living room TV once in a while. 
Also an anemic service called Nvidia GRID, which kinda streams games, but not really. 
From what I've heard and deduced, the NVidia business managers reasoning at the time was the following: 1. 
We will make money from the hardware sales (by far the most expensive Android TV) 2. We will make good money from the ""exclusive"" Android games as well 3. Gamestream will help us sell more GTX PC cards (great!) 4. NVIDIA GRID is a nice little thingie, mostly to stick it to Sony and PS NOW! on Bravia TVs etc., but it should make a little money on the side as well It didn't really work out. 
What went wrong? 
Well, mostly point No. 2. Android gaming was never a big money maker (beyond Candy Crush), and people did not rush head over heels to purchase the Android ""exclusives"" which were mostly remakes of PC and PS2 titles, and the main draw was nostalgia. 
Great, but Nostalgia is rarely a big money maker. 
Also, piracy is a big factor on Android. 
And lastly, some Russian hacker found a way to play the Tegra X1 exclusive titles on any android device. 
At first it wasn't great because other android devices were much less powerful, but with the years passing this changed dramatically. 
By 2017, the pace of publishing exclusive titles ground down to almost a halt. 
Nvidia realized that they are never going to make any serious money out of it with the sales numbers on the Play Store. 
So, by the time Shield 2017 came out (which was the same 2015 product in a smaller case. 
most components the same, and thus minimal investment for Nvidia), the Nvidia business managers changed tactics. 
1. 
We will make money from the hardware sales, but not much, as the high price of the original Shield TV precluded wide adoption. 
We will instead slowly be decreasing the pricing. 
2. We will wind down Android exclusives since barely any money to be made. 
We will finish the games that we have in the pipeline though (pipelines are a couple of years long) 3. Gamestream did not help us sell more GTX cards, and it is not making us money since users have it for free, so we will remove development resources from it and just let it languish. 
4. The newly renamed Geforce NOW (how original, Sony said), will become our main cash cow. 
We will remove the deals and free promos and concentrate on pushing people towards it and extract as much profit as possible from it. 
Now, many of the original Shield buyers (like the author), bought the device for the gamestream, nostalgia gaming (android exclusives + emulators which are amazing on Shield TV), and the media capabilities (KODI). 
Next to no one was interested in the Nvidia GRID. 
I never even activated my 'free 3 months' as the initial offer was (or was it 6 free months, I forget?) Of course, two years later, March 2019, the fact that there is no peep about an update Shield tells us that the NVidia NOW is not doing that great on the Shield. 
Which is why, what once was exclusive only to the Shield, now has discrete software clients for both Windows and MacOS. 
Whichever executive thought the original Shield is going to make money from Android gaming was clueless. 
That doesn't mean the Shield product was bad, just badly positioned. 
If it was positioned as a 'companion product' to your GTX card that let's you stream PC games, watch KODI and media, AND play a few nostalgic exclusive natively - it would have been more realistic, but the profit would have to come from the hardware, and only once, not repeatable. 
This could have been still profitable, but not much. 
Heck, the android exclusives could have been FREE for Shield owners! 
This would help sell more hardware, and make peace with the fact that any profit on the Android exclusive would be negligible. 
Nvidia is a hardware company, first and foremost. 
Where does that lack of vision leave us in 2019? 
1. 
It looks like we won't have another Shield TV iteration 2. Gamestream has not been updated for new games in many months, even for games more than a year old 3. Android exclusives (nostalgia) has dried up and it doesn't look it is ever coming back 4. GeforceNOW is being pushed on everyone, and many new games are being added, but not for the Shield GeForce NOW, but for the Windows and MacOS clients (Mac users finally get to play AAA games on their under-powered hardware) It is a sad end of an era for a gadget that could have taken the world by a storm, if only was sold for what it did best - raw hardware power. 
It reminds me of the fiasco that Nokia had with the N-Gage platform in 2003-05. 
At first they were hardware devices (two) with some great games and portability. 
But then Nokia killed the hardware and made the ""N-Gage"" a ""software platform"" on many Nokia phones. 
The whole thing died about a year later and was never heard of. 
Sad.

Note: this thread is more ""philosophical"" rather than concentrating on a bug or an issue

------

Fourth of March, 2019. 
More than two years after Shield 2017 came out. 
Sure, same specs as SHield 2015, but at least it was an update. 
Released Feb 2017.

Since we're March 2019 now, and not a peep about an update from Nvidia - what is a reasonable man to conclude? 
That there won't be any further updates, of course. 
Nvidia is axing the Shield TV, just like the Shield Portable and Shield Tablet before. 
But why? 
What went wrong?

The following is my, partly-informed, speculation. 
I have a buddy who works for Nvidia in SanFran, and he heard things through the grapewine. 
Doesn't mean they are 100% true, but you never know.

Back in 2015, the first Shield comes out and it is amazing! 
Hardware to die for! 
Not just the most powerful Android TV box at the time (and still is 4 years later), but also a mini-console on its own merit, with a slew of ""exclusive"" games (android-based), and a Gamestream for PC Gamers (master race :), who would like to play on their living room TV once in a while. 
Also an anemic service called Nvidia GRID, which kinda streams games, but not really.

From what I've heard and deduced, the NVidia business managers reasoning at the time was the following:

1. We will make money from the hardware sales (by far the most expensive Android TV)

2. We will make good money from the ""exclusive"" Android games as well

3. Gamestream will help us sell more GTX PC cards (great!)

4. NVIDIA GRID is a nice little thingie, mostly to stick it to Sony and PS NOW! on Bravia TVs etc., but it should make a little money on the side as well

It didn't really work out. 
What went wrong? 
Well, mostly point No. 2. Android gaming was never a big money maker (beyond Candy Crush), and people did not rush head over heels to purchase the Android ""exclusives"" which were mostly remakes of PC and PS2 titles, and the main draw was nostalgia. 
Great, but Nostalgia is rarely a big money maker. 
Also, piracy is a big factor on Android. 
And lastly, some Russian hacker found a way to play the Tegra X1 exclusive titles on any android device.

2. Gamestream has not been updated for new games in many months, even for games more than a year old

3. Android exclusives (nostalgia) has dried up and it doesn't look it is ever coming back

4. GeforceNOW is being pushed on everyone, and many new games are being added, but not for the Shield GeForce NOW, but for the Windows and MacOS clients (Mac users finally get to play AAA games on their under-powered hardware)

GeforceNOW is being pushed on everyone, and many new games are being added, but not for the Shield GeForce NOW, but for the Windows and MacOS clients[/quote] Just as a point of clarification, the GeForce NOW on the Shield is on the same platform as Windows and macOS clients. 
This brings hope that there will be a Linux client (among others). 
The older Shield/GRID system was deprecated. 
Thanks for taking the time to post this; many may not agree with some/many of your points, but it does show that you genuinely care.

I mostly concur, apart from the fact that Nvidia never was a hardware company. 
Not in the way you mean it, at least. 
It's a silicon company, just like Intel (difference being that Intel has its own foundries, where Nvidia does not) They design GPUs and reference boards, but never owned a production line. 
As far back as the venerable Geforce 2, GPUs were produced by TSMC and actual cards were manufactured by add-in board partners. 
Same goes for the Tegra line. 
Or the NForce chipsets. 
The Tegra Tablet/Shield portable was a completely new undertaking for them when it debuted. 
And why they did do that? 
Because after a successful Tegra2, the Tegra3 had lost steam at an alarming rate, the Tegra4 had failed miserably, and they needed to find a way to put their Tegra line of silicon to good use and show it off. 
They wanted to be back into the console market action, and that's exactly what they achieved with the Switch. 
Even though it was an unanimous critical success and was moderately successful commercially, the Shield line is a bottomless money pit for Nvidia. 
It requires an insane amount of support at every level. 
Thank god their GPU business is so good that they can afford it. 
Who remembers the Razer Forge? 
You forgot to mention that they shove a built-in Shield into their ultra-pricey BFGDs, which is again more of an ego project than anything, but at least partly justify keeping the current software team on.

In an interview with CNET‚Äôs Ian Sherr and Playstation boss Shawn Layden, they explained that the reason they had started going to the convention in 1995 was because of the ‚Äúeducational component‚Äù that it offered. It gave them a chance to inform retailers about their product, and that information trickled down to the consumer when they walked into a store to buy a video game. The internet was not as ubiquitous at the time either, so journalists and magazines trying to find the most interesting things at the expo to place on their covers were valuable to competitive companies. It was a great way to establish PlayStation and their games. Now, in an era of entertainment when the internet is the primary method of commerce and press, the purpose of a trade show like E3 seems bygone. Sony‚Äôs decision to leave the show was also made in part to avoid the expectation of having to ‚Äúdrop a new bomb‚Äù at every E3 conference. This means that they are not obligated to stick to the schedule that E3 dictates, rather they are able to drop big news whenever Playstation sees fit. This enables them to implement their plans, ‚Äúto do fewer games ‚Äî bigger games ‚Äî over longer periods of time.‚Äù In Layden‚Äôs eyes, E3 is a show that has to evolve into something that celebrates gaming rather than who can garner the most news. Along with an evolving method of sharing information, the games industry has grown exponentially relative to other forms of entertainment. In an interview with ‚ÄúGame Informer‚Äù reporter Andy McNamara, Layden was asked to speak on the evolution of the industry as a whole and explains how much games have been accepted into the mainstream. He explained how games have gone from being a somewhat ‚Äúniche‚Äù hobby, to ‚Äúbeing one of the three bright stars. Arguably, depending on how you do the math, the largest one from impact on a financial basis.‚Äù In this sense games have ascended to a more respected level, which leaves PlayStation and other companies the opportunity to pave the way for the future of games with products like ‚Äúvirtual reality.‚Äù In the same sense, Layden sees the future of games following the same path of movies in their early days. ‚ÄúI remember years ago you would see, ‚ÄúThis is in Cinemacolor! This is in technicolor! This is in Panavision!‚Äù and I just thought, ‚ÄòOkay. Get me to my movie.‚Äô I think we‚Äôre approaching that for the gaming community where we are just one gaming community.‚Äù Effectively, Sony sees games heading toward a place where consumers no longer care what console/platform they‚Äôre playing on as long as the game is what is wanted. This means that while the company is still trying to keep their own brand on top, they see the need to start cooperating with other companies to create a better industry. This kind of thinking has already been implemented with systems such as ‚Äúcross-play,‚Äù which allow players on different platforms to play multiplayer games, like ‚ÄúFortnite,‚Äù together. Xbox has especially gotten involved announcing the implementation of ‚ÄúXbox Live‚Äù services on mobile devices, and the Nintendo Switch. Evidently, Layden has a pointed out the quick changes in games, prompting PlayStation to lead the charge in both technology and quality of their game line-up. In terms of the company‚Äôs own future with first party games, Shawn Layden had plenty to say about how streaming will fit into PlayStation‚Äôs plans. Currently they have ‚ÄúPlayStation Now,‚Äù a service similar to Netflix which allows players to play game instantly, though the service is riddled with latency issues. Prompted with this issue, Layden suggested that, for now, these types of services will be dependent on where the customer is located since internet service quality is such a huge variable. So instead, the plan is to keep releasing quality games that will attract new consumers. In 2018 they used the games: ‚ÄúMarvel‚Äôs Spider-Man‚Äù which had some of the best sales the company has ever seen, and ‚ÄúGod of War‚Äù which made similar waves in sales as well as being lauded with awards to create excitement for their platform and to grow their audience. Their schedule for 2019 and beyond has games like ‚ÄúGhosts of Tsushima,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Last of Us 2,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDreams‚Äù in store before the PlayStation 5 is announced.","unknown","","13","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","https://www.newuniversity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Layden-e1551741063615-860x280.png","","0","https://www.newuniversity.org/2019/03/04/playstations-view-of-e3-and-their-plans-for-the-future-of-games/","0","0","","","0","239073335110","","false","","","","","","","0","","10000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T23:22:04.124+0000","","0.0","6"

The device -- so heavy it had to be suspended from the ceiling -- generated basic computer images that changed as its user moved. Although it was never anything more than a lab project, the device paved the way for all later developments, including the attempts of the gaming giants Sega and Nintendo, who tried to bring VR to market in the 1990s. Those attempts were less than successful. Sega's VR glasses never made it to shops and Nintendo's ""Virtual Boy"" was pulled from the shelves after six months, eventually finding a place on Time magazine's list of the 50 Worst Inventions. But flash forward around 25 years, and the technology capable of delivering a fully immersive experience is now here. In 2012, developers of a VR device called Oculus Rift went looking for funding on Kickstarter and went on to raise $2.4 million. Two years later, the company, named Oculus VR, was gobbled up by Facebook for $2 billion. Then, in 2016, Sony released its PlayStation VR, where games like Astro Bot Rescue Mission offer a smooth and immersive VR experience, finally offering a more convincing glimpse of what the future will look like. Oculus Rift, which is compatible with PC games, is still the flag bearer for VR technology. And it's the device you need to play the cutting-edge PokerStars VR game that makes virtual reality a truly social experience. PokerStars VR lets you play poker with friends anywhere in the world, in virtual environments where you can pick up tells as if you were playing live. Leading videogame site TechRadar said of PokerStars VR, ""The driving force is socialization...It's almost like being in the same room as your friends."" All gaming in the sector is likely to improve dramatically over the coming years. Shawn Layden, chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, told Game Informer, ""You look at PSVR right now, none of us are going to be able to imagine what it will look like 10 years from now, but the change will be that dramatic."" That's an exciting prospect.eSports making a move Time for an understatement: eSports are huge. Millions of people watch live action games on Twitch; nearly 100 million people watched the League of Legends Worlds in 2018 (a peak of 44 million at the same time) and massive stadiums are sold out across the world. Now eSports may be about to break into traditional media, with the US leading the way. In 2018 ESPN and Disney struck a multi-year deal to broadcast the Overwatch League play-offs. And, as demographics change and games get ever-more realistic, you can expect to see the boundaries between real sports and eSports start to blur. Although eSports have not yet been added to the Olympic Games, discussions have been taking place between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the successful Paris 2024 bid team about adding eSports, possibly as a demonstration event. The Asian Games have already embraced it, suggesting it won't be long before the first Olympic gold is awarded.Cloud gaming It's tough now to imagine a world without Netflix but it wasn't that long ago we were waiting for new DVD releases to be sent in the mail. The market for video games, however, is still lagging behind: it still works on the same model as the early consoles in the 1970s where you buy a game for a specific device, it processes the code and runs the results on a screen. Cloud gaming promises to leave all the grunt work in the hands of a server, streaming the results for you to play on any device. The trouble is that games require constant input from you and even the fastest internet connection introduces unacceptable lag. There are streaming services in operation already but they're not massively popular. PS Now launched in January 2015 but you still need a powerful PS4 on which to play the games. Expect big things from this in the future though. Both Amazon and Google are known to be working on cloud gaming, while Microsoft is also expanding its offering. The untapped market remains huge and the race is on to mine it.New consoles right around the corner Cloud gaming might be the future but consoles aren't going anywhere. Both Sony and Microsoft are gearing up to announce new PlayStation and Xbox consoles -- the first all-new hardware since 2013. Microsoft's Phil Spencer delivered confirmation of the new Xbox at the 2018 E3 show in Los Angeles, where he said, ""Our hardware team is deep into developing the next generation of Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming."" Meanwhile John Kodera, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, told the Wall Street Journal's tech journalist Takashi Mochizuki that the PS4 is entering the final phase of its life cycle, raising expectations that something could be in the pipeline to replace it. Talk of the PS5 has since been commonplace.","unknown","","53","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","https://cmsassets.rationalcdn.com/blog/2019/03/pokerstars-virtual-reality.jpg?fit=inside%7C800:700","","6","http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/en/blog/2019/vr-and-augmented-reality-the-future-of-v-179831.shtml","17","83","","","0","239070316491","","false","","","","","","","0","","25000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T23:00:45.563+0000","","5.68","15"

This ensured that if you played the PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4, you were assured plenty of options to choose from. With the PS Vita ending productio in 2019¬†and Ps3 not even in the rear-view mirror anymore, gamers are left with two free options each month. (Until, of course, the PlayStation 5 releases.) With all that in mind, we asked everybody on the staff if two free games a month was enough, or if they would like to see the PS Plus options expanded each month to include a bit more bang for your buck. Please check out our responses below. Zarmena Kahn ‚Äì I‚Äôm OK with two games a month as long as: A. They‚Äôre not too old, B. They weren‚Äôt poorly reviewed, and C. They offer some value for money. Lucas White ‚Äì I don‚Äôt necessarily think Sony needs to increase the number of free PS4 games. However, I do think the quality of the games offered each month will be under more scrutiny, since the quantity is down. For example, I don‚Äôt think Sony will be able to get away as much with tossing something like Friday the 13th: The Game¬†should be out there when it‚Äôs on the verge of collapse due to legal issues. Online games that have dwindling playerbases, lesser-known indie titles, and games already available for low prices won‚Äôt fly anymore with the people paying for the service for the most part. Considering March‚Äôs games both have generally retained their value outside of the occasional flash sale, that‚Äôs certainly a good sign the team at PlayStation responsible for this stuff has already taken that into consideration. Chandler Wood ‚Äì You are never going to satisfy everyone every single month. Inevitably, some people won‚Äôt like the games that come out, but people forget that PS Plus is a lot more than a ‚Äúfree games subscription service.‚Äù I see the games as a bonus. I am paying to play online in an infrastructure that is increasingly expensive to maintain. I am paying for a membership for other discounts and bonuses. Last year I wrote about how the removal of the extra four PS Vita and PS3 games freed up the budget. Yes, Sony does have to pay for every game they put into the Instant Games Collection. Remember that there were a ton of months that were complete misses, with some very low profile and bad games added. So sure, the two games added this month might not be for you, but some people enjoy them and they are still of a higher caliber than many months we‚Äôve gotten previously. The only fair way to judge this is to look at a full year‚Äôs worth of PS Plus releases on PS4, not a single month. If, after a full year, you find that there are even five or six games you enjoy, that‚Äôs well worth the price of admission. In short, no, I don‚Äôt think PS Plus needs more than two games. Games are already devalued in the eyes of gamers enough as it is with deep discounts, sales, and free game collections. Since the launch of the PS Plus instant games collection, we‚Äôve seen sheer entitlement grow. People just can‚Äôt let a bad month of games roll off their backs and they expect Sony to hand them everything for $60 a year. Cutting back to two might bring some of those people back down to Earth and realize that video games are still a business and that the people who work in them still need to make money. Jenni Lada ‚Äì I think three would be a good number. It would help set the pace for when the PS5 comes out, since then there could be two PS5s each month. But even more importantly, Sony needs to offer more recent games. The Witness came out in 2016 and was a March 2019 PS+ game. Microsoft‚Äôs Games with Gold gave it away for free a year ago. Likewise, Modern Warfare Remastered is from 2016. That‚Äôs not a good look for the first month of the service without any PS3 and Vita games. PaulMichael Contreras¬†‚Äì I think four PS4 games would be a good number, if for no other reason than to match the ‚Äò4‚Äô in the system name. To be honest, I rarely play many of the freebies anyway, but then my review schedule often dictates which games I play. I think Chandler is even more optimistic than I am about people; the vast majority of gamers are going to be upset with the smaller quantity of games received¬†now, economics be damned! But gamers also have really short attention spans. Any outcry will quickly fade, and soon two games will be the new normal. But then, if Sony decides at some point to double the amount of PS4 games received; oh,¬†then¬†the company would be our saviors! Louis Edwards ‚Äì With so many PSVR games available, they should add at least one to the PS+ line-up every month. Annette Polis ‚Äì I think PlayStation could bump those PS Plus freebies up to three games per month. Preferably, this would be one big title and two smaller ones. And while I don‚Äôt think they necessarily need to be super recent games, they also shouldn‚Äôt be games that always seem to end up on sale for a ridiculously low price on a semi-regular basis. I‚Äôd also be happy with a free dynamic theme thrown in there every month. I like changing my dashboard up regularly. Aidan Simonds ‚Äì In terms of quantity, I think an increase to three games a month is a good idea. While pushing out free games every month is certainly a costly venture, I think it would be in Sony‚Äôs best interest. However, even more important is the quality of these titles. The March lineup, with one AAA game and one indie title, is a good template to follow in the months ahead. If Sony only sticks to two games a month, they need to be sure to be high-quality titles that will make the lower number less of an issue for most. Ideally, they would be more recent titles as well, but I won‚Äôt necessarily complain if we get month after month of quality titles. Michael Briers ‚Äì I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind if it remained locked at two per month, so long as we‚Äôre getting relatively big games like The Witness and Modern Warfare Remastered. Chris Penwell ‚Äì Part of the magic of PlayStation Plus is the chance to experience a game you would have never played in the first place. Rocket League is the biggest proponent of this, but over 2018, I completed many of the games made available before. CounterSpy was a fun little shooting game, Bound was an artistic spectacle, and Rayman Legends was a creative tour de force in an otherwise stale genre. Those are just a few examples, and it‚Äôs a shame that these smaller games won‚Äôt be featured if we get 2 AAA games every month rather than a mix of both larger and smaller titles. I‚Äôd like 2 AAA games and then 2 smaller games to make up for the lack of Vita/PS3 cross-buy games. Blake Grundman¬†‚Äì¬†How about a free PSVR game each month too, just to hit all of their currently active platforms? Crazier yet, why not roll up that PS3/Vita savings into some limited version of PSNow? It is high time that they try to compete with Xbox GamesPass. Even bundling a stripped down version of the service (maybe 1-2 games per month of the player‚Äôs choice) might just be the ticket. As for me, I think that two titles a month is just fine. Personally, I find it tough to fit in that many games in a month anyway, so the less backlog I can create, the better.

The theory is that it would follow the Netflix model. Apple‚Äôs apparent idea is to do that with games. All you can play ‚Äì as long as you pay. ‚ÄúI think Apple is getting into a lot of areas that don‚Äôt rely solely on the iPhone,‚Äù Amore said. And that might be because it has to. Officially the world‚Äôs most valuable company again ‚Äì but realizing it can‚Äôt rely on iPhone sales in a saturated marketplace and when it‚Äôs not taking over China in the way it had hoped. ‚ÄúI think the iPhone X is really expensive right now and people are trying to hang onto it as long as they can without replacing it and that means Apple‚Äôs revenue is gonna slow a little so they‚Äôre trying to find a way to supplement that.‚Äù Amore said. Which is where services come in. Charging for cloud storage, music streaming, apps, payments, insurance and so on. Moving into its own original TV programming to take on the likes of Netflix. And reportedly, about to launch a similar subscription service with news too. ‚ÄúThey know investors really love subscriptions,‚Äù Amore said. ‚ÄúSubscriptions really get investors going when it comes to putting more money into acquisitions or things like that.‚Äù The App Store has been a huge success for Apple. It made over a billion dollars over the Holiday season ‚Äì more than 322 million on New Years Day alone. ‚ÄúThey would get a whole new section of gamers that are untapped and are waiting to be catered to,‚Äù said Ray Carsillo, a video game expert. Which explains why this could be such a big deal for Apple. Trouble is ‚Äì there‚Äôs already competition on the scene. This market‚Äôs already overcrowded. ‚ÄúI think that the impact would be seen on what kinds of exclusive games they get. The only way that this would work ‚Äì and of course, Apple still exploring options, would be what kind of games they can offer on their service exclusively,‚Äù Carsillo said. ‚ÄúWhat makes Micosoft‚Äôs X-Box GamePass and Sony‚Äôs Playstation now so successful are the exclusive games they have in their library. If Apple can lure people to develop things exclusively for Apple TV, for the iPhone, for the iPad, suddenly this becomes a more viable service. If they can‚Äôt get the games, the impact will be negligible.‚Äù As always, no comment from Apple ‚Äì it never comments on speculation. But the company that reinvented the iPhone hopes apparently to reinvent how your play your videogames too.","unknown","","24","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","https://america.cgtn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Phil-770x433.jpg, https://america.cgtn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mark_Niu_2-640x360.jpg","","0","https://america.cgtn.com/2019/03/04/apple-plans-to-launch-netflix-of-gaming","0","0","","","0","239063991169","","false","","","","","","","0","","950000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T22:11:34.021+0000","","0.0","521"

Playstation has been very adament on promoting their PS Now service for a while, especially since it only started to release internationally within the past year. Releasing Game Pass on PS4 while it would be beneficial to the consumer, can radically reduce subscription sales for PS Now. 2. They refused to allow EA Access on PS4 so if they suddenly turned around to Microsoft and said ""We want your subscription service on our platform"" I imagine that it would cause even more of a PR nightmare than they already are in. Finally 3. It took them a damn while to accept cross-platform play on PS4 with systems that weren't the PC, so I really can't picture them accepting that sort of deal when they already (begrudgingly, in my thoughts) accepted to allow cross-platform play on PS4","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/ax6dn3/microsofts_phil_spencer_we_want_to_bring_game/ehsfeue/#55895dd74.ehsfeue","0","0","","","0","239045543946","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T20:04:35.621+0000","","0.0","4971"

The move marks the last step of a long, gradual phase-out that included a halt on first-party games in 2015, the discontinuation of physical games and the end to PS Plus freebies . 
If you're looking for the handheld, you'll either have to get lucky at a retailer (if there are any units left) or track down a second-hand model.

The Vita had a long shelf life, but not a happy one. 
It launched in Japan in December 2011, right when phone and tablet gaming were taking off -- Sony was trying to sell people on a dedicated handheld at a time when many could play ""good enough"" mobile games on devices they already owned. 
And while there were high-quality titles like Severed , tepid sales led developers to shy away. 
Things only got worse when you included design complaints (such as a reliance on expensive, proprietary memory cards) and fierce competition from Nintendo.

Sony doesn't appear to be planning a sequel to the Vita. 
That's no surprising at a time when mobile games are still growing, and competition from the Switch could hurt a new entrant's chances. 
However, it's not exactly in a rush, either. 
PS4 sales have usually been strong enough to sustain Sony's fortunes, and the company's future may hinge increasingly on PlayStation Now and other cloud services that aren't tied to a single device. 
Simply speaking, Sony doesn't have the handheld-shaped hole in its lineup that it did several years ago.

After spending a few nights on this - I have decided my project is to be a ""microphone"" based project. 
Sounds simple enough right ? 
( ) As I progressed, it has later on branched out to be something else entirely. 
Read on!

The main of my project is to record audio using Linux (would have used a switch -- but ""Minized"" doesn't have a switch, nor do I have a PMOD connector). 
I could, just supply 3.3V from my Arduino onto one of the PMOD pins ( but then where is the fun in that ). 
I wanted to do something related to the ""Path to Programmable"" material. 
I've tried my best to stick around the course material, but I doubt I've succeeded in that.

First things first, I looked around for some ready-made TCL files I could use. 
These TCL files, generate the project for you, along with the whole IP design and they generate a bitstream too. 
When I searched long enough on Github, I stumbled across the ""Avnet"" repository, which contained different TCL files for Avnet boards https://github.com/Avnet/hdl . 
I used the minized_mic.tcl 
on Vivado 2017.1 . 
Keep in mind you will also need this repository to generate the project.

Once you're done you will have IP designs such as this -

All the other TCL files contained a lot of unnecssary IPs and most of them are not required.

I'll briefly cover the function of IPs in this design and then explain the reasons why this design is flawed.

microphone_mgr_0 : This module receives raw PDM (single-bit) data from PDM mic on MiniZed @ 160 MHz / 64 = 2.5 MHz. 
I don't really see the need of this IP except that it displays some data for the ILA in a registered format.

pdm_fit_0 : This is the ""deserialzer IP"". 
It converts the input serial data line into 16-bit mono audio output which could then be compiled into an audio file. 
Probably the most important IP. 
One of the other guys in this programme - mconners put up this wonderful blog on this project here : Path to Programmable Project Blog . 
Do have a look.

The two above mentioned IPs are connected to ILAs which can be used to monitor the output from the IPs. 
Please note they're connected to another clock of : 160MHz. 
And if one, opens the pdm_fit_0 IP to see the behavioral simulation file - There is a counter which divides the clock by a counter of 4096 times. 
So it's 2.5Mhz/4096 = 610Hz approximately [I think I've screwed up in this number. 
I am not a VHDL guy (Verilog one), but I can dive in again if you all are still curious]. 
At this frequency, it generates 16-bit output data from the modified microphone IP output [which is at a frequency of 2.5Mhz] .

So that covers up this design. 
Great. 
Now we have to find a way to store this data so that it can be accessed by the PS.

Now wait a minute here, firstly why can't I use the registers defined in the IPs --- cause they're not connected to the Zynq by any interconnect. 
That is to say there is no AXI connection in this diagram flow of the microphone. 
As a result, this design is ONLY limited to producing outputs for the ILA , which is something we don't want.

I came up with a solution to this problem which is the incorrect way of approaching it but will be listing it anyways -

a) The wrong approach : Creating a M-AXI IP.

I won't really get to the details of how I made the IP as it is given here quite well : https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2018_1/ug1119-vivado-creating-packaging-ip-tutorial.pdf

So, what really did I want to implement? 
and why was it wrong? 
Since the Zynq PS would be reading the output of the microphone output , the IP would input the Microphone's PDM output and is connected to the PS through a M-AXI. 
Now a Master AXI interface drives stuff. 
We can't access any of the registers in this new IP of mine [through SDK] and it then absolutely defeats the purpose of using it.

b) The correct approach : Creating a S_AXI IP.

This is a much easier IP to use. 
This is because the PDM outputs can now be registered and are given an address. 
Thus, all I need to do is read from this address and I should be getting a 16-bit output. 
The final IP design came around to be like this :

So now as the output is mapped to a register [see code here https://github.com/wady101/MiniZed_PTP/tree/master/06_Project/audio_sink_1.0/hdl ] one can access the audio outputs.

So that's the easy part. 
Now comes the tricky bit, using the SDK. 
It's great! 
I've these registers, for the 16-bit audio data, but new data would be hammered into the registers at 610Hz. 
The question is how do I use this data. 
I planned to put it into the eMMC , since the miniZed doesn't have any SD card slot [ don't have a PMOD connector]. 
So the setup is pretty simple -

After launching SDK, create a new board support package (bsp), and click Finish. 
You would be greeted by another window to choose libraries - make sure to tick mark xillfs [Generic FAT library]. 
On the left click on the Overview Tab > standalone > xilffs [highlighted in pic below] and make sure that fs_interface = 1 [indicates it's a eMMC/SD]

Click on Finish. 
Next open your own bsp, scroll down and import the example for xilffs. 
And just for you all to compare the file , I've attached it here https://github.com/wady101/MiniZed_PTP/blob/master/06_Project/xilffs_polled_modified.c . 
Add the lines to reference the address space of the audio_sink [my custom made IP] in the file. 
So that sums up the SDK part, only for me to realize, that how will I know if I have written to the eMMC. 
It's a bare metal application, means it doesn't even have it's own TCP/IP stack. 
Thus, I cannot connect to it through the wireless IP. 
Also, just to mention, I do not have any wireless IP in my design. 
Looks like this has hit a dead end.

If only I could go down that easily :

Booting Linux from eMMC.

To continue the above project, we will implement ""Petalinux"" on the board. 
Now we all know that Minized has petalinux installed on the board. 
I wanted to do the process from scratch and go through it ab-initio. 
I am sure a lot of the community will benefit from my little experiment...

First thing we have to make sure that Card Detect line has been enabled. 
If this isn't enabled the memory controller on Zynq won't recognize eMMC and Linux won't be able to access this memory unit. 
Generate a bitstream after updating the output products and wrapper. 
Export the hardware so we have out Hardware Description File generated.

Next open the terminal create a new petalinux project :

petalinux-create --type project --template zynq --name mic_ptlnx

Next go to the directory where out hdf has been generated : for me it is different so include the changes accordingly in the following command -

cd ./minized_mic/minzed_mic.sdk/

You will be greeted with a blue DOS like menu. 
Looks pretty cool, gotta give it that ! 
The above command parses the hdf to get the hardware information to be updated in the device tree.

Make sure Subsystem AUTO Hardware Settings is starred . 
This menu allows customizing hardware . 
Have look through each of the various settings . 
One can modify them accordingly. 
Just to point to the users, if you go to SD/SDIO settings > Primary .. We can select where we want the eMMC to be connected through (SD 0 or SD 1), I am leaving it as a default setting - SD 0.

Exit the menu when done. 
Hit Yes if prompted to save config. 
This is done so as to create a checkpoint.

You can configure other options such as the kernel, but I won't be touching that now.

Onto the next step, installing linux on QSPI. 
But before that , let's look at the existing partitioning scheme on the QSPI :

These look like the default settings for generating these partitions. 
I plan to stick to this table as it saves me the trouble of resizing the table. 
My main aim for the petalinux to be setup is -

Boot image configured to boot (First Stage Bootloader and u-boot) --- QSPI

Kernel image for the linux build --- eMMC

File system or Device Tree configuration --- eMMC controller

Next change directory to the project folder. 
Type in petalinux-config and then go to Subsystem AUTO Hardware Settings > Advanced bootable image storage settings > boot image settings > image storage media and change the image storage media to primary flash.

Next press Exit and then go to kernel settings > image storage media > and change that to primary sd [Final look below when you press Exit once].

Press Exit once more and go to SD/SDIO settings. 
Here we want to refer to MIO configuration where our eMMC talks to the Zynq PS (As done in the initial steps). 
Change it to ps7_sd1 (we could use ps7_sd0 too , but since we are following a series of steps , go ahead with sd1)

Finally run the command on the terminal petalinux-build

This is where I am stuck . 
I have updated all the locales to en_US.UTF_8. 
if I type locale, it shows to me it's all the LANGUAGE variables are set to a en_US.UTF-8

A little digging up on the net led me to this blog: https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Embedded-Linux/PetaLinux-build-fails-with-locale-errors-How-to-disable-locale/m-p/894431/hi‚Ä¶

I have fixed each and every locale.py, 
I still land up with this error.

My solution is to install Ubuntu 14.04 and then install petalinux 2017.4. 
So this would probably be my 4th time installing petalinux tools [All the previous times have been attempts to build a docker image, and miserable attempts to run it on a VM]. 
And don't get me started with Vivado.

I am going to put a poll at the end of this blog for the e14 community to decide the future of this project.

So that's about it folks. 
It has been a long journey alright, but I really want to see this project through. 
I want to see the audience and see if I should push through the last frontier. 
I really would like to thank rscasny and the rest of the team to give me this wonderful opportunity to work on Avnet stuff. 
And on that note, I'll be back hungry for more !

Buckle up and ask yourself one question: are you ready, Player One?

The future is virtual

The first documented use of head-mounted virtual reality came in 1968 when a team of computer scientists at Harvard, led by Ivan Sutherland, built a device known as the Sword of Damocles. 
The device -- so heavy it had to be suspended from the ceiling -- generated basic computer images that changed as its user moved. 
Although it was never anything more than a lab project, the device paved the way for all later developments, including the attempts of the gaming giants Sega and Nintendo, who tried to bring VR to market in the 1990s.

Those attempts were less than successful. 
Sega's VR glasses never made it to shops and Nintendo's ""Virtual Boy"" was pulled from the shelves after six months, eventually finding a place on Time magazine's list of the 50 Worst Inventions .

But flash forward around 25 years, and the technology capable of delivering a fully immersive experience is now here. 
In 2012, developers of a VR device called Oculus Rift went looking for funding on Kickstarter and went on to raise $2.4 million. 
Two years later, the company, named Oculus VR, was gobbled up by Facebook for $2 billion. 
Then, in 2016, Sony released its PlayStation VR, where games like Astro Bot Rescue Mission offer a smooth and immersive VR experience, finally offering a more convincing glimpse of what the future will look like.

Oculus Rift, which is compatible with PC games, is still the flag bearer for VR technology. 
And it's the device you need to play the cutting-edge PokerStars VR game that makes virtual reality a truly social experience. 
PokerStars VR lets you play poker with friends anywhere in the world, in virtual environments where you can pick up tells as if you were playing live. 
Leading videogame site TechRadar said of PokerStars VR , ""The driving force is socialization...It's almost like being in the same room as your friends.""

All gaming in the sector is likely to improve dramatically over the coming years. 
Shawn Layden, chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, told Game Informer , ""You look at PSVR right now, none of us are going to be able to imagine what it will look like 10 years from now, but the change will be that dramatic."" 
That's an exciting prospect.

eSports making a move

Time for an understatement: eSports are huge. 
Millions of people watch live action games on Twitch; nearly 100 million people watched the League of Legends Worlds in 2018 (a peak of 44 million at the same time) and massive stadiums are sold out across the world. 
Now eSports may be about to break into traditional media, with the US leading the way. 
In 2018 ESPN and Disney struck a multi-year deal to broadcast the Overwatch League play-offs. 
And, as demographics change and games get ever-more realistic, you can expect to see the boundaries between real sports and eSports start to blur. 
Although eSports have not yet been added to the Olympic Games, discussions have been taking place between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the successful Paris 2024 bid team about adding eSports, possibly as a demonstration event. 
The Asian Games have already embraced it, suggesting it won't be long before the first Olympic gold is awarded.

Cloud gaming

It's tough now to imagine a world without Netflix but it wasn't that long ago we were waiting for new DVD releases to be sent in the mail. 
The market for video games, however, is still lagging behind: it still works on the same model as the early consoles in the 1970s where you buy a game for a specific device, it processes the code and runs the results on a screen.

Cloud gaming promises to leave all the grunt work in the hands of a server, streaming the results for you to play on any device. 
The trouble is that games require constant input from you and even the fastest internet connection introduces unacceptable lag.

There are streaming services in operation already but they're not massively popular. 
PS Now launched in January 2015 but you still need a powerful PS4 on which to play the games. 
Expect big things from this in the future though. 
Both Amazon and Google are known to be working on cloud gaming, while Microsoft is also expanding its offering. 
The untapped market remains huge and the race is on to mine it.

New consoles right around the corner

Cloud gaming might be the future but consoles aren't going anywhere. 
Both Sony and Microsoft are gearing up to announce new PlayStation and Xbox consoles -- the first all-new hardware since 2013.

Microsoft's Phil Spencer delivered confirmation of the new Xbox at the 2018 E3 show in Los Angeles, where he said, ""Our hardware team is deep into developing the next generation of Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming."" 
Meanwhile John Kodera, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, told the Wall Street Journal 's tech journalist Takashi Mochizuki that the PS4 is entering the final phase of its life cycle, raising expectations that something could be in the pipeline to replace it. 
Talk of the PS5 has since been commonplace.

PS chief Kodera: PS4 is entering final phase of its life cycle, which would have negative impact to the unit, but recurring revenue via membership services etc should cushion some of that.

‚Äî Takashi Mochizuki (@mochi_wsj) May 22, 2018 There's been nothing official on when these new consoles will hit, although this year's E3 show, scheduled for June, could provide an excellent platform to name release dates. 
There is heavy speculation that Sony could be ready to sucker-punch Microsoft with a Christmas 2019 release. 
Tech outlet T3 thinks that is a big possibility with the Xbox Two (codenamed Xbox Scarlett) hitting the shelves a year later. 
Backward compatibility seems assured but there are also rumours of a streaming-only Xbox, which would play games from the cloud.

Nintendo is also planning an update of its Switch console in 2019, with a better screen and battery life among the new features. 
The Switch might not rival the PS4 and Xbox One for cutting-edge technology, but its portability, where you stop playing on one device and carry on seamlessly on another, highlights another branch of the future.

Augmented reality - more than just Pok√©mon Go

For a few months in 2016 everyone was talking about augmented reality. 
On July 6, Pok√©mon Go was released and Central Park almost came to a standstill when hundreds of people stampeded in search of a rare Vaporeon.

Pokemon Go was one of the first hit augmented reality (AR) games

Augmented reality merges computer graphics with the real world and while it's different to virtual reality, there are crossovers -- not least that big companies like Hasbro and Disney expect it to be fully mainstream in the next five years. 
For now, you can find lots of free games on your phone and buy physical AR ""experiences"" like Hasbro's Infinity War Hero Vision Iron Man mask. 
Just slip your phone into the mask and get ready to battle the enemy wherever you are.

It's a big assumption to think that Sony would get more money from the latter than the former. Gamepass would need to be massively more popular (~3x) than PS Now could be by itself to make that worthwhile. > If Game Pass is allowed on PS4, that means they will be able to play with Xbox users, along with with platforms It doesn't mean that at all. There's no reason Sony would be forced to allow crossplay together with Gamepass, they're completely unrelated.

Anyone familiar with the PS Store on the PS3 knows full well it was vastly superior to the PS4's in terms of available PSX and PS2 titles to purchase. If Sony mimics Microsoft's (overwhelmingly popular) perpetual backward compatibility model that's already added a huge number of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games to the Xbox One's total library, it would make perfect sense for them to add legacy capability to the PS4 and/or (maybe more likely) the PS5...including digital purchases users made on the PS3 and PS4 stores. Not having to repurchase the same games over again was an enormous PR coup for Microsoft, and it would be for Sony as well. As for how PS Plus (or PS Now) might fit into this, Sony could easily dip into their vast back-catalog of legacy games to add to each month's ""free"" offerings without having to double up on doing so with current-gen titles, which would be especially important with the PS5 as it builds its own catalog. A lot of gamers...myself included...would find immense value in such an arrangement, as so many legacy PlayStation titles are still both very popular and very replayable to this day.","unknown","","15","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/03/04/now-loading-ps-plus-games-minus-two-systems-are-two-games-enough/#comment-4364207256","0","0","","","0","239068173875","","false","","","","","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T22:44:38.164+0000","","0.0",""

Honestly if you look at the content there are only a handful of titles that you can't get on another consoles and namely most of it is available on PSNow. 
So how is this viable on a device like the PlayStation or are they only kidding when they say they want it on any device that someone wants to play on when the single highly used 'gaming device' is the PS4. 
Smart phones are a collection of devices.","unknown","","62","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","4","http://www.vgchartz.com/article/436237/spencer-we-want-to-bring-game-pass-to-any-device-that-somebody-wants-to-play-on/","24","76","","","0","239058187096","","false","","","","","","","0","","743000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T21:31:46.251+0000","","5.98","417"

With Shadow, players can push games to their maximum settings without having to spend hundreds of dollars on costly upgrades. Those games can then be played on practically any device because the gaming computer exists in the cloud. Cloud computing services aren‚Äôt new. For instance, OnLive introduced the concept by launching its service in 2010. Today, we have Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce Now, Sony‚Äôs PlayStation Now, and others, which stream games with the same ease and accessibility of streaming video. What sets Shadow apart is that the service isn‚Äôt limited to a fixed library of games. Users aren‚Äôt required to buy games from a special store and they‚Äôre not locked into using a single device. Shadow provides a powerful Windows 10-based cloud computer, and you are free to install Steam, Battle.net, Origin, the Epic Store or whatever gaming platform you want on it. Install any PC game that you already own at no additional cost. The company custom builds, owns and operates its secure data centers. Each user accesses a dedicated cloud system equipped with an Intel Xeon CPU with eight dedicated threads, an Nvidia Quadro P5000 GPU (equivalent to a GTX 1080), 12 GB DDR memory, 256 GB of storage, and a super fast gigabit internet connection for amazing download speeds. Also, Shadow computers each have a dedicated GPU. The result is blazing performance, with some games achieving over 100 frames-per-second. This powerhouse is also capable of streaming graphics at 144Hz refresh rate and 4K resolutions at 60Hz. These high-end cloud computers can be accessed by practically anything with a screen, including smartphones, low-end notebooks, Macs, tablets, and Android TV. If you don‚Äôt have a compatible smart TV, you soon will have the option to pick up a Shadow Ghost ‚Äì a small set-top streaming box that delivers 1080p and 4K gaming experiences to almost any television. Players can also seamlessly switch between devices without having to quit their games.","unknown","","25","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/deploy/www-972664d/images/spacer-16x9.png, https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/editorial/2019/02/shadow-cloud-computing-image.jpg","","0","https://www.shacknews.com/article/109756/shadows-high-performance-cloud-computing-takes-pc-to-the-next-level","0","0","","","0","239022482116","","false","","","","","","","0","","2030000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T17:27:03.403+0000","","0.0","995"

It‚Äôs true 5G is slated to make way for plenty of changes in how users consume mobile content thanks to a dramatic increase in bandwidth and lowered latency, but if you‚Äôre salivating over the possibilities for what that means for VR gaming in the near future, you may want to step back a bit. Cloud gaming isn‚Äôt a new concept, at least in the world of traditional flatscreen games. Nvidia has GeForce Now, Sony has PlayStation Now, and both Google & Microsoft have their own future cloud gaming projects in the work too. While the infrastructure around gaming-focused edge computing is still very much in its early stages, requiring companies to maintain servers as close to the end-user as humanly possible, the hypothetical benefit to gamers is obvious. Extremely low-powered computers can stream games only previously available on the best of the best rigs. Mobile network operators like Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, Vodafone and many others are signing on to paint the world with 5G starting this year. An increasing number of users will soon have access to data faster than even at-home fiber optic cables can provide, making the migration from wired to wireless almost a forgone conclusion in the minds of many. To wit, some of these companies publicly showed off VR cloud gaming actually working for the first time‚Äîone of the most difficult problems due to the inherent need to keep VR games chugging at or below the 20ms latency threshold, which is considered the bare minimum before users notice anything. Stepping into Ericsson‚Äôs enormous MWC booth, second only to Huawei at over 6,000 mt¬≤ (~65,000 ft¬≤), I cautiously ambled over to an abandoned station outfitted with a Vive Pro and Vive Wireless Adapter. The booth attendant claimed the ‚Äúmixed reality‚Äù Batman experience, which was built in partnership by AT&T, Ericsson, Warner Bros. and Intel, was delivering a total latency between 4 ‚Äì 6 ms through their mock-up 5G network. That‚Äôs basically the bare minimum you can expect, so I was excited to pop in and see for myself. Image courtesy Ericsson Although the real-time rendered experience didn‚Äôt suffer any discernible latency, it was an absolute failure at demonstrating why VR users want cloud gaming in the first place. In short: it was hot garbage. With video from Vive Pro‚Äôs passthrough cameras placed as a backdrop behind my head (that‚Äôs totally ‚Äúmixed reality,‚Äù right?), essentially what I experienced was a 180-degree mess. I was treated to extremely low poly graphics that looked about on par with what can be accomplished on a mobile VR headset like Gear VR or Oculus Go. Adding insult to injury, the two-minute experience, which featured Batman stopping the Scarecrow from‚Äîno joke‚Äîusing 5G for evil, was presented to me in 3DOF and not in the full positional tracking Vive Pro was capable of. I was also told there was an interactive bit using a single Vive controller, but the booth attendants removed it because ‚Äúnobody understood what to do.‚Äù After seeing it in 3DOF and without any level of interactivity, I was pretty skeptical whether it was actually real-time rendered experience or just a 180-degree stereoscopic video. I was assured it all real-time. Image courtesy Ericsson I imagine this was done for the singular reason of showing the setup‚Äôs lowest possible latency. It‚Äôs not an unsubstantial achievement from a technical aspect either, but low latency is as good as useless if this is the sort of toothless VR content AT&T, Intel, Ericsson and Warner Bros. thinks will fit into a real-world use case. Cutting literally every possible corner on content to get latency down to something you can proudly advertise as ostensibly solved borders on willful deception. There was a company at MWC pushing a more realistic version of VR cloud gaming though, warts and all. Two days earlier I got a chance to visit HTC‚Äôs booth where they were showing a similar setup streaming Superhot VR (2017) to a Vive Focus Plus over a mock-up 5G network. Although the implementation was far from perfect, it at least showed real SteamVR content running in the cloud, and delivered in 6DOF like you‚Äôd expect. Image courtesy HTC HTC‚Äôs streaming latency was well above 20ms, and it seemed to be heavily relying on time warp to keep things smooth. To me, it further drives home the fact that even in controlled environments with purpose-built networks completely dedicated to the task of remotely rendering VR games, there‚Äôs still a long way to go before we get plug-and-play VR cloud gaming. While Ericsson‚Äôs demo failed to accurately sell the core idea behind the technology, it did manage to unwittingly reveal that VR cloud gaming is going to be an extreme balancing act when it comes at some point in the future.

It‚Äôs true 5G is slated to make way for plenty of changes in how users consume mobile content thanks to a dramatic increase in bandwidth and lowered latency, but if you‚Äôre salivating over the possibilities for what that means for VR gaming in the near future, you may want to step back a bit. Cloud gaming isn‚Äôt a new concept, at least in the world of traditional flatscreen games. Nvidia has GeForce Now, Sony has PlayStation Now, and both Google & Microsoft have their own future cloud gaming projects in the work too. While the infrastructure around gaming-focused edge computing is still very much in its early stages, requiring companies to maintain servers as close to the end-user as humanly possible, the hypothetical benefit to gamers is obvious. Extremely low-powered computers can stream games only previously available on the best of the best rigs. Mobile network operators like Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, Vodafone and many others are signing on to paint the world with 5G starting this year. An increasing number of users will soon have access to data faster than even at-home fiber optic cables can provide, making the migration from wired to wireless almost a forgone conclusion in the minds of many. To wit, some of these companies publicly showed off VR cloud gaming actually working for the first time‚Äîone of the most difficult problems due to the inherent need to keep VR games chugging at or below the 20ms latency threshold, which is considered the bare minimum before users notice anything. Stepping into Ericsson‚Äôs enormous MWC booth, second only to Huawei at over 6,000 mt¬≤ (~65,000 ft¬≤), I cautiously ambled over to an abandoned station outfitted with a Vive Pro and Vive Wireless Adapter. The booth attendant claimed the ‚Äúmixed reality‚Äù Batman experience, which was built in partnership by AT&T, Ericsson, Warner Bros. and Intel, was delivering a total latency between 4 ‚Äì 6 ms through their mock-up 5G network. That‚Äôs basically the bare minimum you can expect, so I was excited to pop in and see for myself. Although the real-time rendered experience didn‚Äôt suffer any discernible latency, it was an absolute failure at demonstrating why VR users want cloud gaming in the first place. In short: it was hot garbage. With video from Vive Pro‚Äôs passthrough cameras placed as a backdrop behind my head (that‚Äôs totally ‚Äúmixed reality,‚Äù right?), essentially what I experienced was a 180-degree mess. I was treated to extremely low poly graphics that looked about on par with what can be accomplished on a mobile VR headset like Gear VR or Oculus Go. Adding insult to injury, the two-minute experience, which featured Batman stopping the Scarecrow from‚Äîno joke‚Äîusing 5G for evil, was presented to me in 3DOF and not in the full positional tracking Vive Pro was capable of. I was also told there was an interactive bit using a single Vive controller, but the booth attendants removed it because ‚Äúnobody understood what to do.‚Äù After seeing it in 3DOF and without any level of interactivity, I was pretty skeptical whether it was actually real-time rendered experience or just a 180-degree stereoscopic video. I was assured it all real-time. I imagine this was done for the singular reason of showing the setup‚Äôs lowest possible latency. It‚Äôs not an unsubstantial achievement from a technical aspect either, but low latency is as good as useless if this is the sort of toothless VR content AT&T, Intel, Ericsson and Warner Bros. thinks will fit into a real-world use case. Cutting literally every possible corner on content to get latency down to something you can proudly advertise as ostensibly solved borders on willful deception. There was a company at MWC pushing a more realistic version of VR cloud gaming though, warts and all. Two days earlier I got a chance to visit HTC‚Äôs booth where they were showing a similar setup streaming Superhot VR (2017) to a Vive Focus Plus over a mock-up 5G network. Although the implementation was far from perfect, it at least showed real SteamVR content running in the cloud, and delivered in 6DOF like you‚Äôd expect. HTC‚Äôs streaming latency was well above 20ms, and it seemed to be heavily relying on time warp to keep things smooth. To me, it further drives home the fact that even in controlled environments with purpose-built networks completely dedicated to the task of remotely rendering VR games, there‚Äôs still a long way to go before we get plug-and-play VR cloud gaming. While Ericsson‚Äôs demo failed to accurately sell the core idea behind the technology, it did manage to unwittingly reveal that VR cloud gaming is going to be an extreme balancing act when it comes at some point in the future.

I can guarantee the average joe will buy a console over paying for any of these game streaming services.

They refused EA Access because it was only 3rd party games, although I think they regret that because EA Access allows you to play games early and get discounts on them. And if anyone wants to play, stream or upload gameplay first, there going to go to Xbox or PC to do so.

The monthly performance reflected change of 19.38% and indicated 66.57% performance in last quarter. As for a performance, the company‚Äôs showed return of 44.93% since start of the year. This YTD return is simply the amount of profit generated by an investment since the beginning of the current calendar year. YTD calculations are commonly used by investors and analysts in the assessment of portfolio performance because of their simplicity. Earnings Expectations: If we take an observation in front to the next coming days, Street analysts have hope earnings growth of -248.50% for this year and may be getting earnings growth of 57.10% for next year. The firm declared EPS of $-3.8 for the trailing twelve months period. As a general matter investors should not rely solely on an analyst‚Äôs recommendation when deciding whether to buy, sell or hold a stock. It is suggested that a little more digging on your part behind what brokerage companies are recommending will always be to your benefit. Currently the analysts who cover the company rated it a consensus rating score of 1.9. Wall Street analysts presented current consensus target price of $37.88. The price target is the price an analyst believes the stock will achieve during their investment time horizon, which for most firms is 12 months. While price targets are useful, most investors find more value in an analyst‚Äôs conviction level or in the ratio of upside to downside. Observing the Technical Indicators: Here we welcome to the world of short-term trend followers of Pluralsight (PS). Now we here analyzed the 20 SMA trends of Pluralsight. We compared the recent price movement of PS with 20 SMA we see that stock price is trading higher from the 20 SMA. This comparison indication positive percentage difference of 10.96%. The Stock price up move to its 20 SMA, getting attention form Day Traders as 20-SMA is the last stop on the bus for short-term traders. The 50-day moving average is a popular technical indicator which investors use to analyze price trends of Pluralsight. It is simply PS stock‚Äôs average closing price over the last 50 days. 50-SMA is used by traders to gauge mid-term trends. PS stock price current trend is considered bullish. Currently the stock price is 23.87% rising from 50 SMA. On the surface, it seems as though the higher/lower the 50-day moving average goes, the more bullish/bearish the market is. In practice, however, the reverse is true. The 200 day moving average may be the grand-daddy of moving averages. The price movement is above the 200 day moving average ‚Äì trend is upward and PS stock is healthy on basis of this long-term indicator. Since there are so many eyes on the 200-day SMA of Pluralsight, many traders will place their orders around this key level. The 200 day moving average measures the sentiment of the market on a longer term basis. The 200-day simple moving average is one of the most important tools when trading. The simple reason, all traders are aware of the number of periods and actively watch this average on the price chart. The stock price is trading above than the 200 day moving average at time of writing; this is a notable positive signal for long-term investors. We see the stock price distance from 200 day SMA at 29.02%. Tracking the closing price and 52-week high, the current price movement shows that the stock price positioned lower when compared against the 52-week high. As close of recent trade, stock represents -11.05% move from 52-week high. Tracing the 52-week low position of the stock, we noted that the closing price represents a 90.88% higher distance from that low value. Technical analysts compare a stock‚Äôs current trading price to its 52-week range to get a broad sense of how the stock is doing, as well as how much the stock‚Äôs price has fluctuated. This information may indicate the potential future range of the stock and how volatile the shares are. Reading RSI Indicator Pluralsight (PS) attained alert from day Traders as RSI reading reached at 76.36. Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, and according to Wilder, RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. Signals can also be generated by looking for divergences, failure swings, and centerline crossovers. RSI can also be used to identify the general trend. These traditional levels can also be adjusted to better fit the security or analytical requirements. Raising overbought to 80 or lowering oversold to 20 will reduce the number of overbought/oversold readings. Short-term traders sometimes use 2-period RSI to look for overbought readings above 80 and oversold readings below 20.","unknown","","44","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","http://www.stockmarketstop.com/2019/03/stock-enticing-investors-with-scandalous-facts-pluralsight-ps/","0","0","","","0","239016776407","","false","","","","","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T16:49:40.689+0000","","3.79","0"

For Sony, it's 'The only platform where you can play Sony exclusives, Microsoft ""exclusives"", and multiplatform games + PS Now and VR"". For MS it's more sales of their games, good news for the software division. But the question then is, why would people really buy an Xbox if the games are on PS4? Sure, there are some people who would, but I think it would definitely hit sales. Imagine you aren't an Xbox fan, but you want a powerful home console and aren't interested in the Switch.

SO MUCH WORTH IN PAYING 20$/MONTH !!!

AND YOU LITERALLY NEVER ACTUALLY OWN ANY GAMES AT ALL!!!!!!!!

SO HYPE!!!!!!!!!!! Does Game Pass have EA games, since EA has their own subscription service? 
Its a service that falls apart when everyone jumps in. 
No one wants a Microsoft Game Pass, they want a Game Pass that has alot of indies and third parties too. 
It has them, for now. 
When everyone gets on board with a subscription, then a streaming service, everything is split. 
Now you get the Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Amazon, Disney, and even fucking more TV/movie services

More like won

The hardware infrastructure for supporting a huge something like game pass or streaming games is pretty severe, Microsoft could honestly make a lot of money from bringing it to other systems, particularly the Switch that lacks third party support due to Nintendo being dicks to third party publishers and developers Yes but it could turn into a real boon because it becomes a way for Microsoft to profit off of other platforms.

It's called a pivot, and as a gamble it could really pay off GamePass on any device that isn't Microsoft owned is streaming and they've confirmed this. 
The switch isn't getting gamepass like on Xbox it's getting gamepass through xcloud. 
Imagine trying to call someone out when you're the one living under a rock. 
All these games will be made for Microsoft platforms and all the Switch/ps4/mobile gamepass subs are via xcloud. 
Keep paying for that shitty service whilst I play natively. 
Thanks for funding my games again. 
‚ÄúThat is not where you make money. 
The business inside of games is really selling games, and selling access to games and content in means like that is the fundamental business. 
So if you open it up, the more often people can play, the more they‚Äôre enjoying the art form. 
It increases the size of the business.‚Äù

Imagine being as short sighted as OP. Must be hard operating with an IQ under 70. 
They're gonna become a game service platform now. 
Its no secret that Xboxes were sold at losses, but with this they can make tons of money while slowly distancing themselves from making consoles or making the Xbox brand their form of R&D. 
Snoy boys don't realize that hardware sales actually cost the companies more money than they make and just assume that more black boxes in living rooms is what matters. 
They don't understand that software is where the money is made, DESPITE PHIL SAYING IT RIGHT IN THAT ARTICLE. 
There's a reason Nintendo went down the hand held route. 
The CEO from a couple years back mentioned about how the traditional home console is dying away and how the mobile market is booming and how games like Pokemon go are attractive because of being on mobile. 
That right there summarises why they went down the Switch route as opposed to releasing a true home console. 
It's working though the Switch is selling tons in Japan and USA despite having the graphical capability of a Xbox 360 which came out in 2005.

Mobile > streaming > home console

Gaming is the only form of media consumption that hasn't fully transitioned into a streaming market yet. 
Music and TV already have and the companies who own those streaming services are insanely rich now. 
Don't forget any other platform that isn't Xbox or windows will only have access to those games via xcloud. 
The only way to play those games without fucking lag is to either build a win10 pc or buy a cheap Xbox. 
They still accommodated for mobile fags though so it's a win-win. 
It's literal genius. 
Because GP doesn't include every exclusive and games regularly go in and out of rotation kinda like Netflix

The One X is still the best option for 4k console gaming since it performs slightly better than a PS4 pro

>>453226093

I'm a PC gamer retard Meanwhile the Switch is selling faster than both the ps4 and Wii launch aligned and there's even more evidence people would rather buy a hand held than a console. 
Once fifa goes full streaming none of these euro retards will buy a PlayStation console again. 
Who the fuck would bug a ps console when they can stream fifa to every device they own? 
>The CEO from a couple years back mentioned about how the traditional home console is dying away and how the mobile market is booming and how games like Pokemon go are attractive because of being on mobile.

Consoles aren't dying, mobile gaming is just booming. 
It's a different audience. 
And publishers are always chasing a wider audience. 
Nintendo wants those Wii numbers the Wii U failed to get. 
I don't blame them, and he's not technically wrong, but there will always be a core audience that just wants to play games on their consoles. 
Funnily enough, this attitude of selling new consoles with incremental upgrades every few years like the PS4 Pro or Xbox One X is what I've seen destroying interest in the console market. 
I personally know a few people who have just decided to move to PCs instead of bothering with it. 
Which is incredibly short sighted, AAA games still require a shitload of processing player side to be remotely acceptable. 
We don't have the infrastructure, and still won't for decades to come to support streaming games. 
Netflix has to compress the fuck out of 1080p video, I can't imagine trying to stream rendering RDR2's game world. 
it's fun laughing at him. 
he's here every single day shilling for sony and he does it for free.

i just cant imagine how sad your life must be to do that though. 
Mark my words this will be how Microsoft finally dominates gaming. 
No one, literally no one in the industry has the resources to pull this all off except Microsoft. 
Google/Amazon have the servers, the tech and the funds but don't have the 3rd party relations or any history in major game publishing. 
Sony has the games and the history and relations but doesn't have the infrastructure or money to pull something of this scale off (hell they currently hire their servers from Amazon). 
Nintendo is basically the same as Sony but on a smaller scale hence why they accepted Microsoft's deal to put Xbox cloud streaming onto their device even though they won't make much money off it.

Microsoft are flexing their muscles and they will do well I think. 
If all 3 use x86 architecture, it wouldn't be that hard honestly. 
Xbox games are packages built to be deployed to multiple platforms already. 
That said, chances are they'll use xCloud anyway, especially for the Switch. 
definitely. 
Xbox division always end an generation on the red. 
even the 360. 
their plan of money hating shit left and right did a lot of harm. 
Xbox is only alive because MS has infinite money the only ""asspain"" i see in this thread is from xbox fans coping with going third party.

and as for e3, is microsoft actually going to show games for a change, or just do their usual routine of showing multiplats and trying to trick people into thinking they're exclusives? 
How the fuck do you think Xcloud works? 
They arent porting any xbox games to Switch or Mobile, so you would either need to pay to use an xbox console at the azure hub or own your own xbox. 
A game on other systems is a game on other systems. 
No matter how hard you cope. 
Microsoft went third party because the Xbox One is a flop. 
Microsoft can make more money buy selling their games on successful systems instead of their failed one. 
They admit defeat. 
He's mad. 
Just leave him. 
He knows how brilliant of a move this is by Microsoft and he's asshurt. 
If Sony did the same thing by putting psnow streaming onto other platforms he'd admit it's a good thing because of how much money the company will make and more money = more games and services AND you're not losing that exclusivity because all those streamed games are still being played on a PS4/PS3 console. 
Can you blame Microsoft. 
The Xbox One is barely selling. 
They can't make money off of their games even if they tried. 
They need larger platforms to sell their software. 
Xbox One just isn't cutting it. 
If I were them I would sell to a platform with 90 million users too. 
This is clearly the case. 
I'm sure Sony won't go along with it, but it's fun watching all of these kids spam ""cope"" and ""seeth"". 
I also have a feeling a lot of Sony fans in this thread are still upset that they won't be attending E3 and have no announcements to make. 
It's also a way for MS to position itself against Google down the road. 
MS has bigger fish to fry than Sony. 
It‚Äôs definitely fucking kids.

Anyone who‚Äôs taken a 9th grade economics class knows monopolies suck fucking so much the government literally has to step in to insure your water company doesn‚Äôt charge you 4000$ a month just to flush your toilet

Miss me with that monopoly shit. 
I can already play plsyagrjon games through streaming on my PC and according to this thread that's 100% third party. 
Sony are now a 3rd party company. 
Brb going to fraud Sony out of another trial to play BB. Selling the service to play Xbox on another platform isn't 3rd party moron. 
If they ported those 1st party games it would make them 3rd party but all of those games are still on Xbox and being streamed off an Xbox. 
You're literally playing an Xbox when playing those games. 
Either way just buy it anyway so MS can make money off you retards. 
I almost want it to happen then, I'd have to back off entirely to the PC market, which blows dick, but to see these kids have their parents refuse to buy them the latest console would almost be worth it. 
nope. 
i just actually enjoy video games and understand that gaming is better when japan is strong. 
it's not a coincidence that gaming improved this decade when sony and nintendo pulled their heads out of their asses and microsoft flopped.","unknown","","15","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://boards.4channel.org/v/thread/453220218","0","0","","","0","239015101673","","false","","","","","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T16:39:18.400+0000","","0.0","0"

If you're looking for the handheld, you'll either have to get lucky at a retailer (if there are any units left) or track down a second-hand model. The Vita had a long shelf life, but not a happy one. It launched in Japan in December 2011, right when phone and tablet gaming were taking off -- Sony was trying to sell people on a dedicated handheld at a time when many could play ""good enough"" mobile games on devices they already owned. And while there were high-quality titles like Severed, tepid sales led developers to shy away. Things only got worse when you included design complaints (such as a reliance on expensive, proprietary memory cards) and fierce competition from Nintendo. Sony doesn't plan a sequel to the Vita. That's no surprising at a time when mobile games are still growing, and competition from the Switch could hurt a new entrant's chances. However, it's not exactly in a rush, either. PS4 sales have usually been strong enough to sustain Sony's fortunes, and the company's future may hinge increasingly on PlayStation Now and other cloud services that aren't tied to a single device. Simply speaking, Sony doesn't have the handheld-shaped hole in its lineup that it did several years ago.","unknown","","15","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","http://img1.newsdog.today/origin_jpg_5a814a83d09b0eb9c878dc7a3e5b5da4","","0","https://www.newsdogapp.com/en/article/5c7b21e012313a5291818a3f","0","0","","","0","239011459109","","false","","","","","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T16:16:09.755+0000","","0.0","0"

There is no desire at this time to go DCC, so good, clean DC power is all we need. 
As part of my research, forum member and friend Bill Barnwell put me in touch with a fellow who is making his own controllers using power supplies that conver the 110V Ac to 20V DC at an appropriate amperage then wiring it to a voltage controller to use as a throttle. 
Broad brush, it would look like $100 investment in three components, some wiring, and case of some sort and I'd have power aplenty in a semi-ruggedized unit for the Triple O. I have exchanged e-mails with the gentleman that created a system like this, and, even allowing for the it-always-looks-easier-on-YouTube-factor, this looks like a no-brainer. 
That brings me here. 
If it is that easy, it I must be missing something. 
Is it is simple as penny-wise-pound-foolish (cheap parts today that I'll replace every 6-12 months)? 
Or is there a safety factor I am missing (Kid-zilla vs. commercial item as opposed to Kid-zilla vs. DIY throttle)? 
Is it a good system for an indoor set-up or semi-permanent set-up but not one where the power supply goes out, sits on a low table, and comes in at the end of the day? 
For the record, I think the system looks brilliant, and I am inclined to give it a shot. 
CINCHOUSE, on the other hand, is concerned I'd end up spending more time tinkering than enjoying the Triple O, and she is inclined to get a commercial power supply and throttle. 
She argues that he longevity of the ones I use now implies, over the long haul, buying a quality commercial product is the way to go. 
It's a valid approach, years ago I matched a switching power supply to an Aristo Throttle for bench power.

I was given this link for cheaper sources. 
They have 20v too.

https://www.mpja.com/24-Volt-Power-Supply/products/541/

I agree, 5 amp, 24 volt for $15

https://www.mpja.com/24-Volt-Adapter-Power-Supply-5A-Megmeet/productinfo/32885+PS/

Now you need a 5 amp controller, perhaps a used LGB or Aristo, but maybe not cheap.

Is there a reason you want ""clean DC"" as opposed to a PWM controller that you can get much cheaper?

Greg

@Bill: Due to our humidity and proximity to the coast, our computer power supplies typically have a 24-36 month life expectancy.

@Greg: I may have stumbled across a loaded term by using ""clean DC."" I should have said ""basic, no frills, analog power control."" 
My current power supplies, though, do have selector switches ""pulse"" and ""full."" 
""Pulse"" results in the trains not moving so well. 
Also, I've noted over the last 12-18 months several product reviews saying such-and-such thing did not run well on ""pulse power."" 
I am wondering if I am conflating something here. 
I get neutrons. 
Electrons blow my mind.

Eric

With the power supplies suggested above, it seems like a reversible motor controller like this https://www.droking.com/motor-driver-pwm-controller-module-dc-9-60v-20a-dc-motor-speed-controller-pwm-stepless-speed-control-module-adjustable-driver-module 
would be a pretty bullet-proof way to make trains start, stop, and reverse. 
I note that the minimum voltage on this example, though, is 9V. 
Given that my 0-4-0s regularly putter around at ~12V, or 2/3 my rated voltage, does this mean they would go from ""all stop"" to ""all ahead half?"" 
Do I need to look for a controller that operates across the spectrum of voltages, from 0-24 Volts?

From what it seems, I could mount a power supply and two controllers in a used computer case and be in business.

Thanks. 
Much to ponder.

Eric

Eric, normally trains have better low speed response on ""pulse power"" whether it is the old school half wave AC or PWM, so can you explain ""trains not moving so well""...

If your reason is from your experience with the 501's, since they are not G voltage and not G current, and the pulse switch is only half wave AC, I would figure they would run slow and not have a lot of pulling power.

Those packs on their best days are 16 volts and under an amp.

In any case, all modern locos work fine on PWM, no matter what old wives tales say... except for analog locos with ""analog"" sound cards. 
Then the sound card freaks out, loco still runs fine.

More info please.

greg

The light in the tunnel might not be an engine , but a light in the caboose of my own train on my Roundy Round Rail Road ! 
My empire is complete...I think...

Thanks for reposting, Bill

Eric - this article that I posted last year may be of interest.

http://www.trainelectronics.com/PowerController/index.htm

dave

Yes actually I have had less issue with USAT, since they normally use linear regulators, it's just their flashing circuits, like on the caboose, and ditch lights.

Aristo's are worse, that is because some use a microprocessor to do voltage regulation, and PWM really messes them up.

Greg

@Greg. 
In pulse, the locos pull more slowly or not at all in the case of the mogul, ten wheeler, and LGB railbus. 
And, yes, they have 16 Volts at the terminals sometimes. 
Usually they read 14-15 Volts, which can drop to as low as 9 Volts if I've let track connections work loos ore get dirty. 
At 9 Volts, the 0-4-0s slow; the ""heavies"" stop, especially on curves. 
Almost all the trains are 1980-s vintage LGB, so I am not sure it that counts as ""modern."" 
Nothing has a sound card.

@Dave B.: Thanks for the article! 
This confirms my suspicion this could be ridiculously easy. 
I noted your warning about using computer style, metal cased power supplies to ""NOT use this style of power supply unless you properly insulate the high voltage side of the unit."" 
Are there precautions beyond making sure the terminals are out of reach? 
I had been leaning in this direction, so I could have two speed controllers on one supply, but with ""crew"" as young as three, your warning gives me pause. 
I am sharing this link with my father-in-law who is a collector of bits and master tinkerer among other skills.

@David M.: The odds, it would seem, are in my favor. 
Thanks!

OK, barring any glaring safety things, this seems doable.

Eric

Eric - no special precautions are needed so long as you make sure the box you use cannot be easily opened exposing the screws - You might also want to cover the AC power screw terminals with hot melt glue or silicon glue to make sure no one can touch them.

dave

So Eric, your issue is not pulse power not working, your power supply is so marginal that when you ""cut it in half"" there's not enough power to run your loco.

Greg

Gents, thanks! 
I think I see my way forward. 
Let me see what my father-in-law has ready to hand and proceed from there. 
I also have to do a final comfort check with CINCHOUSE. 
Very important!

CINCHOUSE authorized me to proceed. 
I have confirmed effectively nothing is available locally beyond wires and DPDT switches. 
I will submit a parts list for review early this week, because I hate paint $15 to ship a $0.35 part...

Thanks for all the inputs!

Hence why they have always treated it as the flagship product. There was a period of like 10 years where the playstation was the only thing keeping the company afloat. Sony won't do anything that may cut down on sales of the playstation. If people can play microsoft games, they may buy into he microsoft ecosystem. And they may not subscribe to psnow or ps plus. Either way, less money for them. Especially now that MSOFT is forging such a warchest of first party devs. They don't want people getting hooked on halo or Outer worlds or whatever and then jumping ship. Nintendo is selling a handheld that doubles as a mediocre home console. They will always have soemthing that xbox cannot compete with. No matter what games are available to stream to switch, switch players will still need their switches to play games on the bus.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/ax6dn3/microsofts_phil_spencer_we_want_to_bring_game/ehrt7md/#55895dd74.ehrt7md","0","0","","","0","239007214610","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T15:48:04.768+0000","","0.0","4971"

Nvidia has GeForce Now, Sony has PlayStation Now, and both Google & Microsoft have their own future cloud gaming projects in the work too. While the infrastructure around gaming-focused edge computing is still very much in its early stages, requiring companies to maintain servers as close to the end-user as humanly possible, the hypothetical benefit to gamers is obvious. Extremely low-powered computers can stream games only previously available on the best of the best rigs. Mobile network operators like Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, Vodafone and many others are signing on to paint the world with 5G starting this year. An increasing number of users will soon have access to data faster than even at-home fiber optic cables can provide, making the migration from wired to wireless almost a forgone conclusion in the minds of many. To wit, some of these companies publicly showed off VR cloud gaming actually working for the first time‚Äîone of the most difficult problems due to the inherent need to keep VR games chugging at or below the 20ms latency threshold, which is considered the bare minimum before users notice anything. Stepping into Ericsson‚Äôs enormous MWC booth, second only to Huawei at over 6,000 mt¬≤ (~65,000 ft¬≤), I cautiously ambled over to an abandoned station outfitted with a Vive Pro and Vive Wireless Adapter. The booth attendant claimed the ‚Äúmixed reality‚Äù Batman experience, which was built in partnership by AT&T, Ericsson, Warner Bros. and Intel, was delivering a total latency between 4 ‚Äì 6 ms through their mock-up 5G network. That‚Äôs basically the bare minimum you can expect, so I was excited to pop in and see for myself. Although the real-time rendered experience didn‚Äôt suffer any discernible latency, it was an absolute failure at demonstrating why VR users want cloud gaming in the first place. In short: it was hot garbage. With video from Vive Pro‚Äôs passthrough cameras placed as a backdrop behind my head (that‚Äôs totally ‚Äúmixed reality,‚Äù right?), essentially what I experienced was a 180-degree mess. I was treated to extremely low poly graphics that looked about on par with what can be accomplished on a mobile VR headset like Gear VR or Oculus Go. Adding insult to injury, the two-minute experience, which featured Batman stopping the Scarecrow from‚Äîno joke‚Äîusing 5G for evil, was presented to me in 3DOF and not in the full positional tracking Vive Pro was capable of. I was also told there was an interactive bit using a single Vive controller, but the booth attendants removed it because ‚Äúnobody understood what to do.‚Äù After seeing it in 3DOF and without any level of interactivity, I was pretty skeptical whether it was actually real-time rendered experience or just a 180-degree stereoscopic video. I was assured it all real-time.","unknown","","64","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.roadtovr.com/batman-vr-cloud-gaming-5g-mwc-2019/","0","0","","","0","238998032780","","false","","","","","","","0","","1237000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T14:46:15.493+0000","","6.13","657"

That said, the source that reported this first, The Loot Gaming, believes it to be correct. ""Given that Sony has just recently had a private press conference where details were revealed about upcoming titles (including confirmation they'd release in the fiscal year 2020) then I do genuinely believe we'll see The Last of Us Part II in October,"" claims The Loot Gaming's Adam Llewellyn. Previously Llewellyn stated that Sony would add Nintendo Switch and Xbox One crossplay, PSN name changes, and PS Now downloads. All of which have been implemented in one form or another. ""Sony is listening. An internal report has indicated that by the end of this fiscal year, April 2019, console crossplay will come to PS4. There are two reasons behind it. One is that console sales are going to decline; despite PS4's continuing success, we are nearing the end of the generation. Crossplay is expected to be the norm going forward. By activating it now, Sony has nothing to lose. The PS4 software line up will continue to introduce new buyers to the ecosystem and crossplay will be used as a mechanism to keep them rather than as a reason for people to leave,"" wrote Llewellyn at the time. As for The Last of Us Part II, it almost didn't go into development. According to Neil Druckmann, Creative Director at Naughty Dog, the studio almost gave up on making a sequel to the 2013 classic. Reason being, it was felt that the initial attempts at story weren't ""special"" enough. ""Like many of you, we have a deep love for the world of The Last of Us and its characters, and while a sequel may have seemed like a foregone conclusion, that wasn't the case. We knew that it needed to be a story worth telling and, perhaps more importantly, a story worthy of Joel and Ellie,"" he wrote on the official PlayStation blog. ""After spending years on different ideas (and almost giving up), we finally uncovered a story that felt special‚Äîa story that evolved into an epic journey.""

But the *PS4 Pro* isn't enough of an upgrade to warrant the extra money IMO. Maybe it's just me saying this as someone who plays across multiple platforms though. If I wanted a powerhouse *console* I would go with the XB1X. It's much more powerful than the base XB1, and quite a bit more powerful than the PS4 Pro. It also is priced better and has better bundles and sales, whereas the PS4 Pro rarely gets decent sales.

Shortly afterwards, Spencer addressed that teams were also hard at work on the next generation of Xbox, seemingly indicating that the upcoming platform would incorporate these cloud-based elements and that the two announcements were slated for a similar timetable. Considering the plethora of reveals that filled the hour and a half prior to this brief detail, and the debut Cyberpunk 2077 trailer that followed it, these statements went mostly undiscussed, with the understandable belief that Microsoft would go more into detail on these plans when the time is right. Since the time of that press conference, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared that Xbox Game Pass, the subscription-based service that provides Xbox owners access to a rotating library of over 100 games, would be making its way to PC at some point in the future. This piece of news seemed unrelated to Microsoft‚Äôs potential cloud plans, as Game Pass is currently a download-only platform unlike Sony‚Äôs comparable PlayStation Now service, which offers both downloads and streaming. Last month, however, a report began circling originally via Direct Feed Games and later reinforced by Game Informer that Microsoft is currently in talks with Nintendo to bring the subscription service to the Switch through the power of streaming. If true (which is admittedly a big if), this push coupled alongside the plans to bring Game Pass to PC is likely a key aspect of the company‚Äôs previously suggested push for streaming games across multiple devices. Game streaming has always remained a lofty yet often unreachable goal for various gaming companies. In addition to the previously mentioned PlayStation Now, which is also available on PC and other Sony devices but has never attained noteworthy numbers, services in the past such as Onlive have attempted to bring server-based gaming to the masses with limited success. In the past, issues have primarily risen due to the weaker speeds that American internet providers are able to supply to urban areas, which, while continuing to increase in recent years, still pale in comparison to internet speeds provided on an international basis. These lower speeds made any games that required precise button presses or quick reflexes nearly unplayable, leaving fighting games and multiplayer shooters with no clear alternative. As games continue to increase in complexity and scope, and with a new generation of consoles on the horizon, the window for cloud gaming to offer a viable solution for low-cost gaming has rarely been optimal. Nevertheless, Microsoft is clearly eager to move forward with a future free from traditional consoles. Regardless of whether or not these plans may kick off later this year with the help of Nintendo, Microsoft‚Äôs dream of a Netflix for gaming where a monthly subscription and a reliable internet connection are all that is necessary for gaming regardless of where you are or what you are playing on is undeniably ambitious and arguably appealing. While reflex-based titles and the continued rise of VR gaming will likely keep physical platforms as a requirement more so than an alternative for the near future, the lowered cost and simplified nature of game streaming is a promising evolution of the gaming industry as we know it. With Nintendo‚Äôs reported willingness to hop on board a competitor‚Äôs efforts to make this a valid future, and both companies showing their full support for cross-play, the months to come could go down as the start to a significant shift in how we are able to game.","unknown","","22","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","https://hardcore-gamer.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/02/Xbox-Game-Pass-March-2018.jpg","","0","https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2019/03/04/microsofts-streaming-ambitions-could-prove-worth-the-risk/326210/","0","0","","","0","238992084206","","false","","","","","","","0","","461000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T14:05:40.900+0000","","0.0","267"

An October release window, while plausible also puts The Last of Us Part II up against the likes of Call of Duty, Pokemon, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, and whatever else companies have planned for what traditionally is the busiest season of the year. That said, the source that reported this first, The Loot Gaming, believes it to be correct. ‚ÄúGiven that Sony has just recently had a private press conference where details were revealed about upcoming titles (including confirmation they‚Äôd release in the fiscal year 2020) then I do genuinely believe we‚Äôll see The Last of Us Part II in October,‚Äù claims The Loot Gaming‚Äôs Adam Llewellyn. Previously Llewellyn stated that Sony would add Nintendo Switch and Xbox One crossplay, PSN name changes, and PS Now downloads. All of which have been implemented in one form or another. ‚ÄúSony is listening. An internal report has indicated that by the end of this fiscal year, April 2019, console crossplay will come to PS4. There are two reasons behind it. One is that console sales are going to decline; despite PS4‚Äôs continuing success, we are nearing the end of the generation. Crossplay is expected to be the norm going forward. By activating it now, Sony has nothing to lose. The PS4 software line up will continue to introduce new buyers to the ecosystem and crossplay will be used as a mechanism to keep them rather than as a reason for people to leave,‚Äù wrote Llewellyn at the time. As for The Last of Us Part II, it almost didn‚Äôt go into development. According to Neil Druckmann, Creative Director at Naughty Dog, the studio almost gave up on making a sequel to the 2013 classic. Reason being, it was felt that the initial attempts at story weren‚Äôt ‚Äúspecial‚Äù enough. ‚ÄúLike many of you, we have a deep love for the world of The Last of Us and its characters, and while a sequel may have seemed like a foregone conclusion, that wasn‚Äôt the case. We knew that it needed to be a story worth telling and, perhaps more importantly, a story worthy of Joel and Ellie,‚Äù he wrote on the official PlayStation blog. ‚ÄúAfter spending years on different ideas (and almost giving up), we finally uncovered a story that felt special‚Äîa story that evolved into an epic journey.‚Äù If you‚Äôre a fan of video games, check out Transition, Gadgets 360‚Äôs gaming podcast.

A large number of variables have to align for you to get the best experience, server location, internet infrastructure, local network, ISP and more. Sony does not have a very large foot print in the infrastructure area so some will have a good experience and some wont even if everything is optimal. ‚Äã The only thing you can do at your end is make sure PS4 is connected via wired ethernet to network and the dualshock is connected via USB wired to the console if that doesn't improve things changing ISP is only other choice but that is rather drastic. There is a highly remote chance it could be also be network router related but that would also involve spending money to replace, try bringing your PS4 to a friends house that is close to you and see how PS Now performs over their broadband with a different network router from yours.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationNow/comments/atr60i/why_is_there_so_much_lag/ehrjrj3/#595d69bd0.ehrjrj3","0","0","","","0","238987438018","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T13:32:55.639+0000","","0.0","4971"

Sales of digital add-ons for games ‚Äî ranging from small microtransactions to full-scale content expansion packs ‚Äî also continued to gain momentum. The digital shift in the video game industry has prompted publishers to transition their key titles into live services that can function as recurring revenue streams. The companies also are actively seeking out methods to deliver this content directly to consumers in a bid to maximize profits.Digital storefronts This strategy has led to a recent surge in online storefronts on the PC, where publishers can circumvent royalty fees they pay to offer their games on Microsoft Corp., Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. Ltd. consoles. EA, for instance, was among the first major third-party publishers to start offering its titles exclusively on its online PC store, Origin, and analysts think this trend will continue to gain steam. ""I suspect most of the big publishers that either don't have a store of their own or haven't put much effort into it to date are going to step up investments in the next 12 months to see if they can make it a significant profit center,"" said Lewis Ward, research director of gaming and virtual/augmented reality at research and advisory firm IDC. The growing interest in establishing proprietary digital storefronts in many ways mirrors recent moves in the broader entertainment industry, according to Michael Goodman, director of digital media strategies at data and research firm Strategy Analytics. ""Historically, film and TV studios needed third parties such as networks and cable TV providers,"" Goodman said. ""But now they are becoming much more reticent about distributing their content because they can go direct to consumers with their own platforms, such as Walt Disney Co. is doing with its streaming service. Gaming companies are pushing to do the same now, where they can keep their best content exclusive to their own platforms.""On-demand gaming Taking another cue from streaming video services, game publishers are evolving their subscription plans to offer consumers games on demand. EA was the first third-party publisher to embrace this subscription model, with its EA Access and Origin Access services for Xbox consoles and PCs, respectively. Xbox Game Pass also now allows subscribers to play every new Microsoft-published title the same day as its release, while Sony added a library of more than 275 downloadable PlayStation 4 games to its PlayStation Now streaming service. Although recurring revenue streams from subscribers are appealing, many in the industry are still cautiously eyeing the possible repercussions of offering a title that can cost more than $60 at retail as part of a subscription that can be canceled after a month. ""I do believe that some subscribers might cancel after finishing the newest game they wanted to play, but the vast majority will keep their subscription because of the online multiplayer component of those same games,"" said Greg Potter, an analyst with Kagan, a media research group within S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Publishers are okay with this model because hit games often have multiple revenue streams other than the purchase at the point-of-sale."" IDC's Ward cited recent survey data indicating U.S. households that subscribed to EA Access and Xbox Game Pass in the third quarter of 2018 earned more than nonsubscribers and had more gamers per household. ""This implies that their core audiences are wealthy households that can afford to spend more on games, and if several people play games these subscriptions are even more attractive,"" Ward said. ""There's certainly a tipping point beyond which the services could cost publishers money relative to what they would have made absent these subscription plans, but we're not there yet."" According to Goodman at Strategy Analytics, one obstacle that could hinder the growth of game subscription services is the number of offerings that consumers may feel they need subscriptions to. ""The question then becomes, how many subscriptions do consumers draw a line at?"" Goodman said. ""There are a lot of companies that want to reach into our wallets, and that number will only increase as more content makers release their Netflix Inc. competitor and more game makers try to maximize profits.""Capital Markets Concentration and Cross Holdings of Chinese Banks Mar. 01 2019 ‚Äî Do you know out of the Big Four state-owned commercial banks in China, only one has three US institutions ranked as its top five largest holders and it is not the one with the largest market cap? Do you know Temasek Holdings, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, is one of the top five holders of another Big Four Chinese banks? Do you know BlackRock Inc., the largest asset management company globally, has its relative % of equity of Chinese Banks in reverse order to their respective market cap rankings? Do you know Standard Life Aberdeen, a European asset manager, has allocated over 10% of its asset towards global banks and close to 5% towards Chinese companies but only 0.33% of that invested in Chinese banks? In this blog, we leveraged the newly exposed Ownership content and other features of the S&P Global Market Intelligence platform to gain insights into the above by analyzing the concentration and cross-board holdings of the largest publicly-traded banks. We also demonstrated how one can use the same content from the S&P Global Market Intelligence platform to replicate such results. As of February 12, 2019, there were 28 global banks with a market capitalization greater than USD $50 billion as seen in Figure 1 below: Figure 1: Screening Criteria for Global Banks with Market Capitalization of more than USD $50 billion The top 10 are dominated by Chinese and US banks with one UK bank, HSBC Holdings Plc, placed at #7, and one Canadian bank, Royal Bank of Canada, made the 11th spot (Table 1). Table 1: Top 11 Global Banks by Market Capitalization HSBC made news¬π last year when a Chinese asset management firm, Ping An Asset Management, became its largest holder with 7.1%, overtaking its 2nd largest holder, BlackRock, with 5.8% of its holdings. This was due to the additional purchase of 166 million shares by Ping An and the sale of 182 mil shares by BlackRock (Table 2). Table 2: Top Two Shareholders of HSBC Holdings and Their Change in Shares Grouping those 28 banks by country and sorting in descending order by their largest holder concentration, we can see that the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) have the highest holder concentration, followed by Spain and USA, with Canada and Japan having the lowest holder concentration as seen in Table 3. Table 3: Top 28 Global Banks Grouped by Country, Sorted in Descending Order by Top Owner Concentration Expanding on those seven Chinese banks, we see that Central Huijin Investment Ltd. is the largest holder for four of those banks and that the Ministry of Finance is either the largest or the second largest for three of those banks (Table 4). However, it is interesting to see these varied cross-board ownerships of selective Chinese banks. Three US institutions, BlackRock, Vanguard Group, and Capital Research are the second, third, and fourth largest holders, respectively, of China Construction Bank. The combined ownership of these three institutions is 4.1%, and is not replicable for the remaining banks (Table 4). With 19% ownership of Bank of Communication, HSBC is the second largest shareholder of a bank with one of the smallest market capitalization in the region (Table 4). Temasek Holdings‚Äô 2.0% share made it the fifth largest owner of the largest bank in terms of market cap, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (not shown in table). Table 4: Top Shareholders of the Seven Largest Chinese Banks Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence as of 12 Feb 2019. For illustrative purposes only. For other BRIC banks, we also noted cross-ownership. For example, American institutions placed second to fourth in ownership of PAO Sberbank of Russia with a combined total of 6.6% after Central Bank of the Russian Federation‚Äôs 52% share. JP Morgan was the top holder of the Indian HDFC Bank with its 17.4% share. Standard Life Aberdeen‚Äôs 4.6% ownership of Banco Bradesco and Dodge & Cox‚Äôs 1.9% ownership of Ita√∫sa placed both respectively as the third largest holder of these Brazilian banks. In addition to analyzing ownership of both public and private companies, the S&P Global Market Intelligence platform can also be used to look at holdings by institutions, filtering by additional factors like industry and region. Here is an example of all the BlackRock holdings filtered just for US and Chinese banks in descending market value (Table 5). From this list, we can see that out of its top 10 holdings, three were Chinese banks: China Construction Bank, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, and Bank of China, ranked as its 6th, 8th and 9th positions. However when filtered based on % of Shares Outstanding of those banks, the respective orders are reversed: 1.66%, 5.06%, and 7.09%. Table 5: BlackRock, Inc‚Äôs Holdings of Public Chinese and US Banks For an Asian sovereign wealth fund like Temasek Holdings, all of its holdings of public bank shares are non-US banks. Singapore‚Äôs DBS Group Holdings is its largest bank holdings followed by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China as its second largest bank holding (Table 6). Table 6: Temasek‚Äôs Holdings of Public Global Banks Lastly, we looked at ownership of a European asset manager, Standard Life Aberdeen Plc. China Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China are its 4th and 6th largest holdings among its Asian bank holdings (Table 7). The percentages are relatively small when compared to its holdings of banks in the ASEAN region: Table 7: Standard Life Aberdeen Plc‚Äôs Holdings of Public Asia-Pacific Banks ‚Ä¶ Or other sectors of the Chinese equity market: Table 8: Standard Life Aberdeen Plc‚Äôs Holdings of Public Chinese Companies In summary, based on the above Ownership and Holder analysis from the S&P Global Market Intelligence platform, we are able to obtain deeper insights by showing you examples on the holdings of specific asset managers, sovereign wealth fund, commercial banks on some of the largest publicly-traded banks in China. By using the same content from the platform, we also demonstrated how we can easily replicate such results by industries, geographies etc. Copyright ¬© 2019 by S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Feb. 25 2019 ‚Äî The South Korean multichannel market should see a year of upheaval as the three incumbent telcos look to acquire some of their cable competitors to accelerate growth in 2019. LG U+ is already in discussion with CJ Hello while KT Corp. considers acquiring D'Live through its direct-to-home arm KT Skylife. Likewise, SK Broadband expressed interest in acquiring both t-broad Holdings Co. Ltd. and D'Live. This is not the first time a telco has proposed a cable MSO acquisition in South Korea. SKB's proposed merger with CJ Hello in 2015 was banned by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission, which prohibits any operator from monopolizing the multichannel market with subscribers over one-third of the total subscriber base. Should the government have no intention of modifying the existing rule, KT would fail to acquire any other operator while SKB's plan to boost subscriber share to 30% would unlikely be approved. Given its relatively small subscriber base, LG U+ stands the highest chance of success from a regulatory perspective if it were to acquire any of the cable MSOs. Cable has been the dominant multichannel platform in terms of subscriber share in the market and yet IPTV is expected to take over from 2019. As of December 2018, Kagan estimated cable and IPTV made up 43.8% and 42.9% of the total multichannel households, respectively. By the end of 2019, IPTV's share is expected to reach 45.3% as cable's share drops to 41.9%. Ever since the launch of IPTV in 2008, telco-owned IPTV operators have successfully gained traction in building their respective subscriber bases. A key factor has been the bundling of IPTV with the telcos' data, fixed voice and/or mobile services at affordable prices. Therefore, many of the cable TV subscribers are willing to take IPTV as a secondary multichannel connection. This also explains why the market has maintained a multichannel penetration rate of over 100%. As of year-end 2018, the market's multichannel penetration was estimated at 167% and is expected to reach 177% by 2023. In terms of subscriber share, KT is currently dominating the market with its IPTV service branded Olleh TV and DTH-services branded KT SkyLife and Olleh TV SkyLife. KT's subscriber share as of June 2018 was 31.07%, followed by SKB with 13.8%, CJ Hello with 12.83% and LG U+ with 11.49%. The potential tie-up of LG U+ and CJ Hello would secure about a quarter of the market's subscribers, superseding SKB's existing share and posing a threat to KT's long-term dominance. In response to the potential threat, KT is considering the acquisition of D'Live, the third-largest cable MSO with 2.4 million subscribers as of June 2018. SKB, on the other hand, is interested in buying both cable MSOs Tbroad and D'Live to secure a subscriber share of over 30%. The telcos aim to quickly boost and retain their subscriber bases and hope to accelerate revenue growth in the long run through the potential M&A deals. Low average revenue per user has always been a challenge to South Korean multichannel operators, especially cable MSOs, which can hardly raise the price due to churn concerns. As of December 2018, IPTV's average blended ARPU was $15.15 per month while cable's average blended ARPU of both analog and digital was significantly lower at $8.69 per month. Cable operators had a hard time fulfilling their digitization commitments while not shifting the cost to subscribers and facing significant churns for six years until 2016. Merging with one of the telcos could be a surviving opportunity for operators of the declining platform. The potential wave of M&A would consolidate the market into fewer players. The telcos would secure a bigger subscriber share and further dominate the market while the remaining cable operators would find it even harder to stay relevant. Yet it is uncertain if the growth of the country's multichannel subscriptions can be sustained. Many multichannel households that currently have both cable and IPTV connections would likely cancel cable service if it were offered by the same company, and the cable platform would further shrink as a result. Feb. 18 2019 ‚Äî In 2018, IPTV overtook direct-to-home as the second-largest multichannel platform in the world by subscribers after cable, accounting for 23.4% of the total market of 1.07 billion. With year-over-year growth of 14.3%, IPTV was the fastest-growing platform in 2018, driven by large subscriber additions in Asia-Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Western Europe. Over the next five years, IPTV is projected to post a 7% subscriber CAGR, second only to pay digital terrestrial television with a projected 8.5% five-year CAGR. While cable remains the dominant multichannel platform globally, cable subs are modeled to continue declining over the next five years at a 0.3% CAGR, largely due to migration to IPTV in Asia and Western Europe. China, India and the USA remain, by far, the largest multichannel markets, collectively claiming 57% of the global subscriber total in 2018. China and India alone are expected to account for half of the global market by 2023. The global multichannel economy generated $230.06 billion in video service revenues in 2018, a 1.1% year-over-year increase, while multichannel penetration breached 60% by year-end. North America remains the most lucrative multichannel region accounting for over half of global revenue. The effects of cord cutting are only observed in North America where multichannel subscribers, revenue and penetration are projected to decline in the foreseeable future, as well as in a handful of oversaturated markets, including Singapore and Hong Kong. In Europe, the biggest threat to traditional multichannel services is posed by free-to-air DTT and lies in the integration of over-the-top and catch-up TV services into DTT platforms as well as the ability to stream channel packages via hybrid boxes.Global multichannel market overview Kagan estimates that in 2018, the global multichannel market grew by 3.1% year over year, down from 3.9% in 2017, as rapid subscriber growth is slowing down in China. After the global multichannel market breached 1 billion subscribers in 2017, 32.3 million new homes adopted pay TV services in 2018 to reach 1.07 billion multichannel homes by year-end. We project that the global multichannel household growth will continue to decelerate in the foreseeable future with most markets across Europe, North America and advanced multichannel markets of the Asia-Pacific reaching saturation. The global market is forecast to post 2.7% year-over-year gains in 2019 with a 2.4% 2018-2023 CAGR. Global multichannel video subscriptions are forecast to increase to 1.21 billion by 2023, adding 136.3 million net subs over a five-year period, while multichannel penetration is forecast to increase to 61.2% in the next five years, up from 60.1% in 2018.Global multichannel subscribers by platform While cable TV is expected to remain the largest platform on a global scale in the next five years, its share is forecast to decline from 52.3% in 2018 to 45.8% by 2023, largely due to analog subscriber churn and market share gains by IPTV operators. IPTV, the fastest-growing of the three major pay TV platforms, is modeled to capture a 23.2% market share by 2023.Global multichannel revenue The global multichannel economy generated $230.06 billion in video service revenues in 2018, a 1.1% year-over-year increase, with more than half earned by North American pay TV providers. The region's pay TV operators, however, lost 2.4% revenue year over year due to steep subscriber declines, despite growing average revenues per user. Western Europe remained the second-largest multichannel economy, accounting for only 17.7% of the global total in 2018. Latin American multichannel revenues expressed in U.S. dollars declined in 2018, mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations in most of the region's markets. Given its comparatively high video service ARPUs, North America is expected to remain the most lucrative multichannel economy in the coming five years, despite being only the third-largest by subscribers and experiencing subscriber declines. The region is modeled to account for 43.2% of global video service revenues by 2023. Despite having the lowest multichannel ARPUs among the six regions analyzed, Asia is projected to overtake Western Europe as the second-largest multichannel economy by 2023, due to the sheer size of its market accounting for 18.8% of global multichannel revenue. IPTV remains the fastest-growing multichannel platform, except in North America and the Middle East and Africa, where increasing pay DTT rollouts are driving revenue growth. Pay DTT is the only platform in Western Europe that is losing revenues, largely due to falling ARPUs. Although cable experienced overall subscriber declines in Western Europe and Asia in 2018, revenues increased on the back of digital subscriber and ARPU gains.Credit Analysis Flying Into The Danger Zone; Norwegian Air Shuttle Feb. 13 2019 ‚Äî The headwinds are picking up for Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (‚ÄúNorwegian‚Äù), the eighth largest airline in Europe. The carrier has been battling with rising fuels costs, increased competition from legacy carriers, and persistent aircraft operational issues. Norwegian‚Äôs problems are a continuation of what have been turbulent months for budget airlines in Europe resulting in a collapse of Primera Air, based in Denmark, near-default of WOW air, Iceland‚Äôs budget carrier, and most recently bankruptcy of Germania. When we pull back the curtain and review the creditworthiness of European airlines to explore further some of the causes for Norwegian‚Äôs turbulent period, we see Norwegian‚Äôs business strategy and financial structure have made the carrier highly exposed. Coupled with the traditionally slow winter season, the airline may have to navigate through the storm clouds forming on the horizon.A View From Above S&P Global Market Intelligence has developed CreditModel Corporates 2.6 (CM2.6), a statistical model trained on credit ratings from our sister division, S&P Global Ratings. The model combines multiple financial ratios to generate a quantitative credit score and offers an automated solution to efficiently assess the credit risk of both public and private companies globally. Within CreditModel, the airline industry is treated as a separate global sub-model to better encompass the unique characteristics of this industry. Figure 1 shows the overview of S&P Global Market Intelligence credit scores obtained using CreditModel for European airlines. Norwegian‚Äôs weak position translate into the weakest credit score among its competitors. The implied ‚Äòccc+‚Äô credit score suggests that Norwegian is vulnerable to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, and its financial commitments appear to be unsustainable in the long term. In addition to Norwegian, Flybe and Croatian Airlines rank among the riskiest carriers in Europe and share a similar credit risk assessment. The airlines with the best credit scores are also Europe‚Äôs biggest airlines (Lufthansa, Ryanair, International Airlines Group (IAG), and easyJet). The exception among the top five European airlines is Air France-KLM, which is crippled by labour disputes and its inability to reshape operations and improve performance.Figure 1: Credit Risk Radar of European Airspace Overview of credit scores for European airlines Note: IAG operates under the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, LEVEL, IAG Cargo, Avios, and Aer Lingus brands. (January 3, 2019) S&P Global Market Intelligence‚Äôs sister division, S&P Global Ratings, issued an industry outlook for airlines in 2019 noting that the industry is poised for stability. It stated the global air traffic remains strong and is growing above its average rate at more than 6% annually. The report also cited rising interest rates dampening market liquidity while increasing the cost of debt refinancing and aircraft leases. Oil prices are expected to settle, and any further gradual increases in oil prices are expected to be compensated by rising airfares and fees. The most significant risks for airlines are geopolitical. Potential downside scenarios include a crisis in the Middle East or other disruptions in oil, causing oil prices to spike. The possibility of trade wars and uncertainty surrounding the Brexit withdrawal agreement represent additional sources of potential disruption or weakening in travel demand.Flying into the danger zone Although Norwegian has so far dismissed any notion of financial distress as speculation, it has simultaneously implemented a series of changes to prevent further turbulence. The airline announced a $230mm cost-saving program that included discontinuing selected routes, refinancing new aircraft deliveries, divesting a portion of the existing fleet, and offering promotional fares to passengers to shore up liquidity. In Figure 2, we rank Norwegian‚Äôs financial ratios within the global airline industry and benchmark them against a selected set of competitor European budget carriers (Ryanair, easyJet, and Wizz Air). Through this chart, we can conclude that Norwegian‚Äôs underlying problems are persistent and the company‚Äôs financial results are weak. Norwegian‚Äôs business model of rapid growth and a debt-heavy capital structure have resulted in severe stress for its financials. Norwegian ranks among the bottom 10% of the worst airlines in the industry on debt coverage ratios, margins, and profitability. This is in sharp contrast to other European budget carriers, which are often ranked among the best in the industry. On the flip side, Norwegian‚Äôs high level of owned assets represents its strong suit and gives the carrier some flexibility to adjust its operations and improve performance in the future.Figure 2: Flying at Low Altitude Norwegian‚Äôs financial ratios are among the worst in the industry Note: Presented financial ratios are used in CreditModelTM Corporates 2.6 (Airlines) to generate quantitative credit score in Figure 1.Faster, Higher, Farther Norwegian has undergone a rapid expansion in recent years, introducing new routes and flying over longer distances. Between 2008 and 2018, the carrier quadrupled its fleet from 40 to 164 planes. This enabled it to fly more passengers and become the third largest budget airline in Europe, behind Ryanair and easyJet. However, unlike its low-cost rivals, Norwegian ventured into budget long-haul flights. After establishing its new base at London Gatwick, it started operating services to the U.S., South-East Asia, and South America. As a result of this expansion, Norwegian‚Äôs capacity as measured by available seat kilometres (ASK) and traffic as measured by revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) grew nine-fold between 2008 and 2018, as depicted in Figure 3. By offering deeply discounted fares, the carrier was able to attract more passengers and significantly grow its revenues, which were expected to reach $5bn in 2018. However, to be able to support this rapid growth, Norwegian accumulated a significant amount of debt and highly increased its financial leverage. This rising debt is putting Norwegian under pressure to secure enough liquidity to repay maturing debt obligations.Figure 3: Shooting for the Stars Norwegian‚Äôs rapid growth propelled by debt Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. All figures are converted into U.S. dollars using historic exchange rates. Figures for 2018 are estimated based on annualized YTD 2018 figures. For illustrative purposes only. (January 3, 2019) Norwegian‚Äôs strategy to outpace growing debt obligations by driving revenue growth is coming under pressure. The data tells us that expansion to the long-haul market and the undercutting of competitors to gain market share proved to be costly and negatively impacted Norwegian‚Äôs bottom line. Operational performance, measured as unit revenue (passenger revenue per ASK) and yield (passenger revenue per RPK), have been slipping continuously since 2008, as depicted in Figure 4. Negative free operating cash flow required Norwegian to continuously find new sources of capital to finance its operations, and profitability suffered. The carrier was able to ride a tailwind of low oil prices and cheap financing for a while, however, the winds seem to be turning.Figure 4: Gravitational Pull Slipping operational and financial performance","unknown","","22","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/images/marketintelligence/research-images/top-11-global-banks-by-market-capitalization.jpg, https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/images/marketintelligence/research-images/top-28-global-banks-grouped-by-country.jpg, https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/images/marketintelligence/blog-images/credit-risk-radar-of-european-airspace-resized.png, https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/images/marketintelligence/blog-images/shooting-for-the-stars-new.png","","0","https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/50172772","0","0","","","0","238973198680","","false","","","","","","","0","","539000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T11:41:55.574+0000","","0.0","309"

The console arrived in Japan at a time when smartphones and tablets became popular. These platforms were already playing a decent quality, the reason why PS Vita had a disadvantage and was condemned to face a dispute of a position in the market. With the decrease in sales, the developers also moved away, which definitely condemned Vita to the goal. According to Engadget there are no sequels planned for Vita and Sony seems to be planning to utilize the sale of PS4 and PS Now. Portable consoles should be forgotten, at least for the foreseeable future.

It doesn't matter whether it was created on PlayStation Now, or on an actual PS3. 
If you are playing a PS4 game, then you have to copy the saved data from PlayStation Now to Plus online storage using the in-game saved data utility in PlayStation Now, and then copy the saved data from Plus online storage to the PS4. 
There is no way to copy saved data from PlayStation Now to a PS4 without a Plus subscription, and a PlayStation Now subscription.","unknown","","32","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://community.playstation.com/content/pdc/us/en_US/pdc-communities/support/games-services.topic.topic.0.25.html/i_lost_all_my_data-Hp4Z","0","0","","","0","238954114796","","false","","","","","","","0","","42803000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T08:43:28.986+0000","","0.0","4199"

The discontinuation falls in line with the words of Sony Interactive Entertainment‚Äôs senior vice president Hiroyuki Oda, who told Famitsu last year that 2019 would see the end of the console‚Äôs production. The Vita had big shoes to fill and a heated battle to fight when it first launched back in 2011. Despite offering an improved handheld-console experience akin to that of its predecessor, it‚Äôs market debut came at a time when mobile gaming on smartphones and tablets was taking off in a big way. This was on top of stiff competition from the Nintendo 3DS. A revised, slimmer model released in 2013 did not do much to help, and the console was faced with several design criticisms, most notably it‚Äôs use of branded memory cards. Sony stopped developing its own games for the Vita in 2015. It later stopped offering physical game copies last year and as of last month, the PlayStation Plus subscription service would no longer offer free games for both the Vita and PS3. In a 2017 interview with Polygon, Chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment‚Äôs worldwide studios Shawn Layden admitted that the Vita had fallen short of the company‚Äôs initial expectations. ‚ÄúVita just didn‚Äôt reach that critical mass with the audience,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd thereby, the development community doesn‚Äôt get behind it, and thereby, the audience doesn‚Äôt come, and it‚Äôs a quick negative spiral effect.‚Äù According to Hiroyuki Oda, there are no current plans for a successor to the Vita. The PS4 has maintained healthy sales figures for Sony, and the company is focusing instead on cloud-based services such as PlayStation Now. Any handheld replacement would have to face off against the Nintendo Switch and its gargantuan sales numbers, as well as the monster that is mobile gaming.

Despite being one of the best selling games of last gen, and far & away the most highly rated in the franchise, Rockstar doesn‚Äôt seem to want to have anything to do with GTA IV. Rockstar didn‚Äôt even do much to celebrate its 10th anniversary at the end of last year. Previous GTA games have been re-released many times. GTA3, Vice City and San Andreas have all been released on PS3 and PS4, with PS3 receiving a PS2 Classic version of San Andreas and even a proper HD disc release of it as well, while Xbox 360 got first a port of the original Xbox game, then an HD version based on the mobile iteration. In terms of Spin-Offs, the PSP ‚ÄúStories‚Äù side entries got PS2 adaptations which are still downloadable on PSN for the PS3 as PS2 Classics, and even the DS/PSP‚Äôs Chinatown Wars has been kept alive by readily available mobile versions. And yet, except Xbox One backwards compat... GTA IV hasn‚Äôt received a proper re-release. It‚Äôs not even available on PS Now although Red Dead Redemption is. *It would be easy to write off that GTA IV would not a steady revenue source, but keep in mind that the much less popular L.A. Noire is single-player only and received a full remaster for not only PS4 & Xbox One but even Switch!* Certainly it‚Äôs a clunkier game 10 years on compared to GTA V or Red Dead Redemption 2 but GTA 3 is, too, in comparison to more polished latter 6th generation games like San Andreas, Manhunt 2 and Bully. I think Liberty City and the trio of protagonists across GTAIV and its expansions is more than worth revisiting and calling attention to, if not necessarily for gameplay strength then for what it was attempting to do narratively - and this is coming from someone who really only experienced and appreciated GTA IV secondhand through my then-girlfriend who just devoured every inch of the game world. I was way more into RDR but surely GTA IV still has its merits?","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/ax4394/any_theories_why_grand_theft_auto_iv_has_not_been/#5320f5e24.ax4394","0","0","","","0","238943026778","","false","","","","","","post","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T06:46:38.945+0000","","0.0","4971"

Some games will require the dualshock4 controller (those that use the touch panel or motion sensing) , and some can be played with xinput controllers (like Xbox 360/one). If you are asking for Bloodborn in particular, I dont see why it wouldn't work on other controllers but I can be wrong. There also seems to be some issue with Metal gear 3 because the original used the dualshock3 pressure sensitive buttons but can't confirm because I haven't play it in psnow.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/awsgr9/just_beat_dark_souls_remastered/ehquhjs/#57865d054.ehquhjs","0","0","","","0","238925218805","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T03:51:53.177+0000","","0.0","4971"

But instead of charging for a large library of games, Shadow lets you ‚Äúrent‚Äù a remote, virtualized gaming PC with a GTX 1080 card equivalent, and fill it up with the PC games you already own. For $35 a month, you can access your remote PC and play your games on Windows, macOS, or Android. But there‚Äôs no easy way to get any of those platforms to play nice with a TV. The Shadow Ghost is the solution. An evolution of the previous Shadow Box device and vaguely reminiscent of the Steam Link, the Ghost is designed to remove all of the compromises of streaming games that are possible at the moment. Its low-power, fanless hardware can nonetheless pump out 4K games at 60 frames per second, or 1080p at 144Hz for those fast-paced shooters and fighting games.","unknown","","15","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2019/02/252cde2e.png, https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2019/02/38f31b12.jpg","","0","https://pcproactive.wordpress.com/2019/03/03/the-shadow-ghost-is-a-curvy-little-box-that-streams-pc-games-in-4k/","0","0","","","0","238917560583","","false","","","","","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T02:46:43.141+0000","","0.0","0"

Not much to really say on the Xbox side. 
As for Sony...

I haven't played Darksiders II, though I hear it's decent. 
Syberia is probably decent if you like the mystery style games. 
Wanted Corp.. it's not anything amazing, but I found it decent enough. 
That was the PS3 version, so I have no idea how the Vita version is. 
Can't say anything else about the rest.

Sony also mention that NEXT March, they're dropping PS3 and PS Vita from the PS+ free games thing. 
So far only said that two PS4 Games will remain. 
Guess we'll see in the future what that does.

Also, glad I never bought MN9 since it'll be free. 
lol Was considering buying Ratchet and Clank, but I guess I waited long enough. 
lol

Yeah. 
Sony clarified to Polygon that the PS+ lineup will consist of TWO PS4 games and NO OTHER free games starting next March...

Oh boy! 
I sure do love paying more for less!

Here's hoping that Sony will offer something else (like maybe include PS Now with PS+) but I'm not going to hold my breath.","unknown","","38","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","http://iyouboushi.com/forum/index.php?/topic/1396-ps-plus-games-with-gold-nintendo-online-march-2019/page-2","0","0","","","0","238903961490","","false","","","","","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-04T00:53:20.688+0000","","2.89","0"

With some companies, it's more likely you'll get an english speaking agent over the phone, but you really just need to try and see what happens.

I have completed every mission on this game by myself by either playing that mission with a second PS3 console or with the AI partner.

This thread is a showcase of performing what many people have considered as an ""insane trophy"" that can only be done if you ""have a great partner"", I've done the game without a partner, so I kind of refute popular opinion regarding this game with that.

This playlist shows the runs of all these missions with either the AI partner or with my second PS3. 
The most difficult missions to complete were Mentor 05 and Master Ninja 04 with the AI partner, both missions require an insane amount of luck, but also a lot of awareness of the enemies of the map because one wrong move can cause the AI partner to get destroyed. 
The most difficult missions to do with my second PS3 were Master Ninja 05, because it was tough to set up the second PS3 twirl for this one, it kept not working and Ultimate Ninja 01 because I couldn't move my second PS3 to the ideal position so Alexei and Liz kept switching to where I was.

If any of you were wondering, although at the beginning of every video I make, I show off what the controller looked like when it was ready to twirl, below is the image of how my controller was set up. 
The controller that was used is the Hori FPS Plus and it is compatible with the PS3 and the PS4. 
The controller allows for the button you want to turbo to be turbo'd without placing an object over the button to hold it down, which is very beneficial for twirling the missions with a 2nd PS3 for this game.

With the extra cost of a 2nd system and a turbo controller, wouldn't it be easier, more fun and better to just play with a friend?

I guess congrats?

I do play with friends, I just wanted to see how possible it would be to do these missions without one of them. 
The ""extra cost"" wasn't an issue for me, I have 6 PS3s and 6 turbo controllers, I help myself out a lot if I ever need to boost the online trophies for games hahaha.

You are aware we're on the forum for the game right? 
You can see the threads that were made for this game by looking at the trophy list, this thread was made in regards to a trophy on this game, why don't you report the thread and see what the mods have to say about it?

Actually, this was something that someone challenged people to do. 
I argued with them back then saying it would be impossible to do that, however then I realised I could try to do it with 2 PS3s alone, that still counts as not being helped by someone else. 
This thread wasn't supposed to offend anyone, so if you're offended then I apologise. 
I don't know why you'd be offended though, over the years people call the team missions insane and say that you ""need a very good partner"", I only needed myself as a partner. 
Are you gonna change your post again to try and make it look like I was bullying you? 
Hahahaha.

I didn't work very hard to do this, heck I've done it twice. 
I just got bored one day and thought of something to do in the game that someone else never did before and this was it and because it's in regards to a trophy, I thought I'd show the trophy hunters on this site that it is possible to do this alone if you have two PS3s and a turbo controller. 
A lot of people this year have two PS3s now so they could help themselves rather than trying to seek out a co-op partner, if they're up for the challenge. 
What did this thread have to do with you anyway? 
You haven't got the game on your trophy list. 
Although you mock me for making a video that goes against popular opinion of the platinum for this game, is there any point I made in that video that provided incorrect information about exploits of the game that make it easier?

You made a 14 minute video, debunking a subjective rating of a 9 year old video game.

You did a 2 player run by yourself because some random chick was like, that would get my respect.

You ever just think you shouldn't care bro?

Don't get me wrong, it's a cool achievement and I'm sure the ninja gaiden 2 veteran community that may or may not exist, might truly appreciate it. 
Idk.

I could have made the video earlier, you're right. 
But I still see people to this day going on forums or telling people that the platinum for the game is insane and a 10/10 difficulty game although they used exploits that make it much easier than it should be. 
The platinum for the game is still obtainable, so the video still has some relevance and hopefully it gets people who would otherwise be afraid to try the game out on the basis that it's a ""hard platinum"" to try it out. 
I still have people asking me for help with the team missions on a regular basis, so there is still a demand for this game. 
I also have friends that do play it with me daily. 
I have enjoyed this game for around 2000 hours so I was looking for more challenges for this game that could test my skills. 
I recently did a run of Master Ninja 03 solo with counters only and the weakest 1 hit attack. 
I don't play my favourite game solely for the approval of other people, but hey if someone wants to challenge me to do shit on the PS3 version then by all means, I will accept as long as it's humanly possible. 
I normally like to do things that don't rely on another person's participation in the mission because I don't like to bug others to do missions with me if it's a grindy requirement that I must do. 
I'm sure we've all had a game that we play for fun regardless of what other people think about it, to me this is the game.

I could have made the video earlier, you're right. 
But I still see people to this day going on forums or telling people that the platinum for the game is insane and a 10/10 difficulty game although they used exploits that make it much easier than it should be. 
The platinum for the game is still obtainable, so the video still has some relevance and hopefully it gets people who would otherwise be afraid to try the game out on the basis that it's a ""hard platinum"" to try it out. 
I still have people asking me for help with the team missions on a regular basis, so there is still a demand for this game. 
I also have friends that do play it with me daily. 
I have enjoyed this game for around 2000 hours so I was looking for more challenges for this game that could test my skills.

What's worse? 
Overrating or underrating? 
I think underrating is worse.

Ninja Gaiden is hard. 
Hence why people want your help. 
A 10/10 probably not. 
But it's subjective and actually believable that NG was the hardest game the 10/10 rater has ever played.

When people start giving child of eden 3/10, you know all they're interested in, is publically admitting they have autism.

I can personally respect them for that, it takes balls being so brave, you know what I'm saying?

Playing for the challenge is good. 
I can dig that. 
Playing for respect or bragging rights is just sad imo as we're gaming lmao.

Gaming achievements do not translate in the real world very well. 
So getting actual respect for your gaming achievements is close to impossible.

I doubt dark rose even gives a fuck that you've done it. 
Shame. 
Least you can say you've done something cool in NG2 I suppose.

I don't care what Rose_Dark thinks about what I did, I just recently remembered it was a challenge set by an ignorant trophy hunter, I doubt they'd be able to do the missions the way I've done them for the past 4 years. 
You wouldn't understand what it's like when someone goes on the forums to rate the platinum for NGS2 as 10/10. 
They get my help and with me, I get 100% of the kills for them in the missions, then as soon as they get the platinum after doing the missions with me, they'll go on the forums to say ""the missions were insane, you really need a good partner for this"", not admitting that they used all the exploits in the book to get those missions done while every skill based thing was something I took care of. 
It's funny because people get massively ass licked for doing something like the co-op spec ops missions for Modern Warfare 2 on their own, but when I do a trophy that for years has been regarded by many as a trophy that stops people from getting a ""10/10"" platinum on my own, I get disrespected by people who have no knowledge of the game or any idea as to why I play the game. 
It was fun for me to do all these missions alone, I wouldn't put myself through something on my favourite game that would bore me to death, there are leaderboards for the game where someone can get the highest score by repeating the same move for 10+ hours, some of my friends pursue high scores on the leaderboards by doing this, this is something I wouldn't personally do.

You did all that because of one post? 
One persons 'respect'?

Bruh, you played yourself.

I changed my post because I thought of something better to say. 
You couldn't bully me if you tried lmao.

What I completely fail to realize is why you even bothered to continue the argument as far as you did when you don't even own the damn game......for that matter you don't own ANY hack & slash games! 
FFS the hardest game you even have is DOOM

How would you ever realize the satisfaction of actually beating a game which is hard as shit to the point of driving you insane. 
Yet one still keeps playing it to the point where you are very comfortable and then wanna try something different, something new and fresh!

This TYPE of thing Sergen did is nothing new but certainly fresh. 
People who master a game, which majority of the community agrees is hard, tend to do handicap playthroughs like a No Upgrade Run or full Stealth or No kills or No damage runs and even combinations of these. 
It's not to show off but for their own satisfaction. 
What Sergen has done is along the same lines. 
You basically NEED a partner for the team missions even if they are just going to twirl but having a Turbo controller, a 2nd PS3 and setting up the twirl himself Sergen has removed that requirement. 
Mind you this is not something just ANYONE could do. 
Even if you had the the equipment you would still require the skill to actually KILL everything vice versa even if you had the skills you would still need all of the equipment! 
So yeah, a hack & slash nut like myself I can definitely say that what Sergen has accomplished is worthy of praise. 
Its hella dope!

I know this thread might be a bit outdated but i never left my opinion about this here. 
I don't know why you started this to bully him for that honestly? 
I could understand you, if he would only post his stuff what he did in the game actually, like his Speedruns etc. Sergen showed up a none discovered method how you could do the Team Missions, - which is greatly skill dependent and requires some devices to do it. 
This Thread is basically for every NGS2 player interesting (we have some NGS2/Trophy Hunters here at this Forum) and for the people who wants to aim for the Trophy but can't find a trust worthy partner. 
Also this discovery can be also helpfull for every player, the reason for that is; you don't have to be worried that your partner might fail a run for odd missions, but if you do it alone it's all up the you and you can have a fair 1on1 for most fights as well.

He was showing off a kind of a support, how to do those Missions on an alternative way. 
He also didn't compared at this Thread the difficulty between this and other games like Injustice. 
But we can't help it, if you see this differently. 
üôÉ But you guys can't get over it, if someone diggs into a game further than just the Trophies ... üòí

He wasn't also even saying that this method is a 11/10 or something like that... he had a very good reason why he released those ""10/10"" Videos and if needed i could explain you that as well. 
All you did basically was starting up a pointless argument, which still continues 'til today. 
(Hope it got resolved somehow)

Also since you seem to be a very active member here and perhaps very liked as well, it wouldn't look good for you, to make fun of people for things like this, when they never bothered you. 
At the end, we just saw what happened actually üôÑ

There wasn't a need to start things like that tbh.

I could understand if you would start to come across like that, if i would have created a Thread like that, since i admit; i wasn't always fair in the past. 
When i was for a few months inactive i had the time to think about a few things. 
But well why at Sergen's Thread tho? 
I don't really get it.

I've decided to make this thread to show that it is possible to achieve the ""All Missions Successfully Completed"" Trophy without assistance from another human player. 
I have completed every mission on this game by myself by either playing that mission with a second PS3 console or with the AI partner.

This thread will act as a celebration to those who have also accomplished this feat for this game. 
I do not blame anyone who won't be able to do this because it requires two PS3s and one turbo controller in order to work successfully.

This playlist shows the runs of all these missions with either the AI partner or with my second PS3. 
The most difficult missions to complete were Mentor 05 and Master Ninja 04 with the AI partner, both missions require an insane amount of luck, but also a lot of awareness of the enemies of the map because one wrong move can cause the AI partner to get destroyed. 
The most difficult missions to do with my second PS3 were Master Ninja 05, because it was tough to set up the second PS3 twirl for this one, it kept not working and Ultimate Ninja 01 because I couldn't move my second PS3 to the ideal position so Alexei and Liz kept switching to where I was.

@xDLl0YD091x has been making progress towards achieving this accomplishment for the game, he has successfully completed Ultimate Ninja 03 and 05 with video evidence that shows that he was capable of doing them with his second PS3. 
Here are links to his videos: Ultimate Ninja 03 and Ultimate Ninja 05 . 
Hopefully soon he'll join me in the no human assistance club for this trophy.

If any of you were wondering, although at the beginning of every video I make, I show off what the controller looked like when it was ready to twirl, below is the image of how my controller was set up. 
The controller that was used is the Hori FPS Plus and it is compatible with the PS3 and the PS4. 
The controller allows for the button you want to turbo to be turbo'd without placing an object over the button to hold it down, which is very beneficial for twirling the missions with a 2nd PS3 for this game.

Awesome job Sergen! 
I enjoy it when people have these out of the box ideas, have the skill to do it and share it with the community. 
Thanks for sharing. 
Nevermind the criticasters. 
You don't have to please them or explain to them why you did it.

I don't have a second PS3 but is it possible to do this method using one PS3 and a PS4 since the game is on the PS Now service ? 
I wouldn't mind having to train a lot for this game but I'd like to know this before buying a turbo controller, thanks.

It would be possible to do that, but the game would lag very badly because a lot of your bandwidth would be used streaming the game. 
You need great internet to do the game with PS Now. 
I really recommend if you want to do the game in a fair way then you find a partner for the game who would twirl for you rather than trying this with 2 PS3s. 
It‚Äôs not something I would have tried without having the trophy already.","unknown","","26","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://forum.psnprofiles.com/topic/44884-all-missions-successfully-completed-alone/?page=1","0","0","","","0","238890343538","","false","","","","","","","0","","2167000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T23:04:00.541+0000","","0.0","1048"

Did you play RDR2? The game has ""latency"" issue with when you move Arthur and when he actually moves. People complained, and yet still finished the game. The biggest issue isnt internet speed anymore, it's how close you are to one of the servers. The minimum speed for a service like this, which, again, Sony is already doing, is 5 Mbps. DSL speeds. We have actual results already of people using a game streaming service with these speeds and no latency at all. Google has also done it. You keep posting about latency over and over in this topic, but don't actually say that real issue. Where you are relative to a server. It's the same issue CURRENT multiplayer games have, and one that Australians complain about every time a new game is released. They get put on servers with Asian countries that destroys the ping of the game. If you have a PC or a PS4, go try the 7 day trial of PSNOW, and try playing from your phone's hotspot connection. I'll bet it works if you're close to a server.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/awssq1/beyond_the_console_xbox_leaders_detail_microsofts/ehq9ih3/#5320f5e24.ehq9ih3","0","0","","","0","238889067523","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T22:54:15.889+0000","","0.0","4971"

Sorry since im probably posting in the wrong place but it seems the other subs are useless. So im posting the chat i had with support which explains my issue about not being able to download Bloodborne. (the only proof i ever had it is in my transaction history). Also i bought it free back in march 2018 with ps plus so it makes sense. ~~also only bought ps plus to play it~~ Support.:Hello, My name is ----. how may I assist you today? Me:Hello i had an issue with not being able to download one of my games Me:I hope that i can fully explain in one text Support.:OK. Go ahead please. Me:In march 7 2018 i downloaded the game called bloodborne. A few months later i deleted the game. Then i purchased a ps now subscription in which i used to download bloodborne. The problem is, the game license is now locked behind the ps now subscription. I hope that you can help me renew my original license Support.:I'll be more than happy to help you with your game. Support.:I'll be working with the information you entered before starting the chat. Support.:Can you give me a hand and provide me with the information below? - Your First and Last Name - Your current phone number Me:****** Support.:Thank you. Me:Ive tried remotely downloading and restoring license but these 2 options did not work Support.:OK. Support.:Thank you for waiting, I was checking in the system that the game was acquired when you had activate PS Now activated in your account, to be able to play the game again without any problem you have to keep PS Now activate in the account, if this subscription is not active, the game will be locked. Me:But can my previous license be renewed? Or can i get a new one? Me:Not through ps now of course Support.:In this moment I can see that the subscription activate, PS Plus . Support.:In this case you have to make sure that PS Now is activate in your account and once that happen you have to restore licenses again and the game will be unlock. Me:So you are telling me i have to buy ps now and then restore my license so i can obtain the license from before ps now? Support.:If the subscription was ended and it was not renew it, the game acquired with that subscription will be lock. Me:But i had the game before that subscription. I want access to the way it was before i ever purchased ps now Support.:I understand your concern and you wish to enjoy the game again. Unfortunately the game will work if PS Now is activate in the account again, it is the only way how this will work in the account. Me:Can you transfer me to someone with the authority to restore the previous license? Support.:I understand you would like to get a different answer but at the moment you have reached the support line that takes care of these type of request and we all have the same tools and resources, I am afraid that your request cannot be fulfilled at this time. I am sorry, for any inconveniences this may cause. Me:Ok then. Thank you Is there anyone who can transfer (?) Back the the license to how it originally was?

And their massive Azure network. Both these contribute to lower latency which like you said is the biggest holdup. Then expanding the reach of the service, Switch, iOS, PC, etc. In-house compatibility improvements with older games like what they currently do with backwards compatibility. And potentially a full library of titles, purchases, gamepass, not just a limited selection. My sense is they will do all these things considering the rumors of putting out low-end hardware built for XCloud themselves. I think MS is still very much committed to a high end console experience, people shouldn't assume that's going anywhere. But their goal with streaming is to *expand* their reach, make all games/services a viable option for people who aren't console/xbox gamers. Still have to buy a console or a high end PC if you want to run native, but streaming is actually kind of a brilliant way to deliver high fidelity games/graphics on very low cost hardware, for a lot of people it's going to be a better experience than what they currently have, and get them started in the general xbox ecosystem.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/awssq1/beyond_the_console_xbox_leaders_detail_microsofts/ehq3mjf/#5320f5e24.ehq3mjf","0","0","","","0","238879936472","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T21:42:43.655+0000","","0.0","4971"

PsNow until very recently arguably has a worse service(streaming only until very recently) but still out sales game pass. It's no argument that Playstation exclusives are top tier and Xbox ones have been disappointing outside of forza. But to keep it strictly to games on the service. What games do you feel as strong enough to make game pass worth paying for as a mobile phone user and potentially switch users? Since pc gamers and Xbox one can already use it the market will be expanding to mobile phones. Sales for Xbox brand are mostly in NA which has data caps/throttling even for unlimited mobile data. So mobile gamers can't stream consistently on the go so they will be a lot of playing at home. Looking at the game pass list I don't see any games that are brand sellers. As for the strength of the brand Xbox ones recent disappointments with games hurt the brand. Sony and switch both have clear exclusive features that set it apart and that is why xbox is working on something else to sell people on. As an owner of a switch, Xbox one, and ps4 I use the Xbox as a plex machine. >Those numbers give us no idea about the size of the Xbox One business, and the squishiness of the data indicates that Microsoft doesn‚Äôt have the confidence to say many clear, unambiguous things about the size of the Xbox One business >The sales milestone is more evidence that Sony is ‚Äúwinning‚Äù the current console generation ‚Äî although, importantly, Microsoft stopped sharing solid hardware sales information for the Xbox One in 2015. Microsoft has since replaced hard sales numbers with relative metrics that allow the company to show growth, without explaining how many people are picking up Xbox Ones or using its services. https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/8/18173711/ps4-hardware-sales-ces-2019","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/awssq1/beyond_the_console_xbox_leaders_detail_microsofts/ehpuni5/#5320f5e24.ehpuni5","0","0","","","0","238864894048","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T19:46:20.353+0000","","0.0","4971"

Generally speaking, you should get whichever controller feels best in your hands I went with the DualShock 4 because I play a lot of platformers and the layout makes the dpad much easier for me to use. The touchpad can also be really useful as a mouse if you're couch gaming. As a bonus, you'll have access to PS Now and PS4 remote play (if someone will let you use their PS4), but you'll have to be wired or buy Sony's overpriced dongle. It works fine with regular bluetooth adapters, but the headphone jack ONLY works if you're wired The main downside is that most games on Windows require a compatibility layer. Steam has one built-in that makes everything pretty painless and adds minimal lag. Even games that have native DS4 support will require a compatibility layer if you're using bluetooth. This is only on Windows, on Linux the controller works both wired and bluetooth and shows up like any other controller The other big downside is that Steam's built-in dualshock support won't show you the battery percentage. There's software out there that can show it to you (ds4windows), but I'm not aware of any simple apps that just warn you when the battery is low Finally, your button prompts won't line up in a huge chunk of games, you'll still see xbox buttons on screen. This is hardly an issue, but can be a bit of a pain when you're first learning a game","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/awpn2u/pcgamers_which_controller_do_you_use/ehptf51/#58125c4d1.ehptf51","0","0","","","0","238862935936","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T19:30:33.273+0000","","0.0","4971"

Shooters are where it becomes a real issue. By time constraint I take it you're talking about the trial period duration because there aren't any constraints in the full subscription. You're right, the lack of DLC is a massive letdown which almost makes me not want to play non-GOTY editions of games. If you're planning on getting a PS4 anyway, PS Now is actually significantly better on PS4, so I'd recommend getting the free trial after you buy the PS4. Unlike on PC, you can download and play games locally, (so no input delay, video compression, etc.,) and if you're playing locally you can also buy and play the DLC as you would if you purchased the game normally.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/awsgr9/just_beat_dark_souls_remastered/ehpskgi/#57865d054.ehpskgi","0","0","","","0","238861550938","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T19:19:26.174+0000","","0.0","4971"

PSP lost the function of its built in psn store, could happen to PS3 too at some point. for the most part, the only PS3 games/ports available on PS4, is streaming through PS Now paid subscription service, but that is not digital ownership of the games. well people can see how PS3 psn store turns out, but it wouldnt be surprising if they shut it down at some point. recently they cut off support for Vita, its only a matter of time before Vita games stop being available in the market.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaten/comments/awpr6s/the_psx_remakes_of_shin_megami_tensei_i_ii_and_if/ehpcyia/#578fb9854.ehpcyia","0","0","","","0","238834365578","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T15:59:27.339+0000","","0.0","4971"

The fact that they have downloadable games has been communicated ad nauseum on the PS Store where they advertise the PS Now service. And in the ps4 sub on Reddit they've discussed it in many threads. If you pretty much stay away from Sony related things and don't own the console I can see how you'd miss this, but you'd have to actually try to avoid the advertising on their store and not follow any discussion of the topic on Reddit if you did own a PS4 and still didn't know about it. I mean I don't think I've seen a commercial before a YouTube detailing the downloadable games, but then again I've not seen one about Game Pass in that situation either. PS Now is definitely not a great service though, at least not for me. I own all the ""Greatest Hits"" that make up a good portion of their downloadable games and despite the fact that I have great fiber internet service I still can't get past the lag and compression artifacts that come with game streaming. For me personally, game streaming will never take the place of playing locally. Well, I guess I can't say *never*, but it would take some major advancements to networking technology for me to consider it. Current capabilities just don't cut it, even for streaming from my PC to a Steam link on my own local network. Or from my Xbox to my PC using Microsoft's home streaming solution. Input lag and compression artifacts just kill the experience.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/awssq1/beyond_the_console_xbox_leaders_detail_microsofts/ehpbsen/#5320f5e24.ehpbsen","0","0","","","0","238832199985","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T15:43:08.298+0000","","0.0","4971"

Even if it did, should this venture for MS be successful they can then invest in studios to create tailor made games for different markets. Like I've said like three times at this point, success in one generation doesn't mean anything. Likely going to keep that market share? Dude, no. It took the PS3 years to recover despite owning the market with the PS2. What if the next Xbox is cheaper? what if the specs are better? what if it happens to have better launch titles? better marketing in general? And sure there are hints the next PlayStation will be BC but we don't know, what if it wasn't. Who knows maybe Sony's post PS2 hubris will have taken effect again. I found their last E3 to be pretty arrogant despite the selection of games shown to be phenomenal. And here's the thing, even should xCloud and GamePass succeed there's space for Sony as well if they're capable. They already have PSNow so they have some infrastructure as it is. It doesn't seem like a priority for Sony at this time however. And if MS did care don't you think they'd stop launching all their games on PC, stop with all this talk of cross platform play, tearing down barriers, game streaming on any devices. And if the rumours of GamePass coming to Switch turn out to be true isn't that a really fucking weird thing to do if you cared about the success of a competing platform. The box you play your games is irrelevant at the end of the day. What is the negative here? if it works out it means games will see more money put into them and you're no longer required to buy a device you don't want just to play a handful of games. I literally don't see a downside.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/awssq1/beyond_the_console_xbox_leaders_detail_microsofts/ehpbr89/#5320f5e24.ehpbr89","0","0","","","0","238832140354","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T15:42:41.281+0000","","0.0","4971"

Are you insane? And the install base is still important. Barring a major fuckup like the XBox One and PS3 price differences, customers are likely to stick with the company they know, especially with the next generation where their current library will carry over. Why subscribe to GamePass when it's not on the console you own? Makes more sense to get PSNow on your PS5 instead.

If you're looking for the handheld, you'll either have to get lucky at a retailer (if there are any units left) or track down a second-hand model. Load Error The Vita had a long shelf life, but not a happy one. It launched in Japan in December 2011, right when phone and tablet gaming were taking off -- Sony was trying to sell people on a dedicated handheld at a time when many could play ""good enough"" mobile games on devices they already owned. And while there were high-quality titles like Severed, tepid sales led developers to shy away. Things only got worse when you included design complaints (such as a reliance on expensive, proprietary memory cards) and fierce competition from Nintendo. Sony doesn't plan a sequel to the Vita. That's no surprising at a time when mobile games are still growing, and competition from the Switch could hurt a new entrant's chances. However, it's not exactly in a rush, either. PS4 sales have usually been strong enough to sustain Sony's fortunes, and the company's future may hinge increasingly on PlayStation Now and other cloud services that aren't tied to a single device. Simply speaking, Sony doesn't have the handheld-shaped hole in its lineup that it did several years ago.

Having been a 360 owner, I linked my old Xbox account and boom, already 20 of my favorite classics from that generation were in my ready to install - MGS remastered, Far Cry 2, Blood Dragon, Alan Wake, Fallout 3, NV, XCOM Enemy Within, etc... fuck that PS Now streaming shit. Xbox has better games with gold, better sales, better QOL... I don‚Äôt think Sony really cares about their console community. Sure, I prefer the controller, their menu layout, their exclusives, but really all I‚Äôll personally miss is Uncharted. I bought a PS2 Slim from Craigslist recently, so if I want my favorites from that generation then I can go there. I don‚Äôt know why people keep saying PlayStation 4 is the better console. I can see how it was when they first came out. Hell, that‚Äôs why I bought one. And it‚Äôs not bad, but if they did backwards compatible for the previous two generations, had better sales and free Plus games (and released MGS1 and 4) then I probably would have stayed put.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/awr7r4/switching_from_ps4/ehox27s/#55895dd74.ehox27s","0","0","","","0","238793586862","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T10:29:42.118+0000","","0.0","4971"

Today, I just can't hate PS4 or Xbox, no matter how hard I tried in last 20 years, I always end up with both each gen. 
While Nintendo is hit or miss, mostly miss.

After Crackdown I didn't want to use my X, if I never paid for Gold/Game Pass, I wouldn't have gone back to play Super Bomberman, Adventure Time and some more Mortal Kombat. 
But that is the beauty, I don't want to spend money on Xbox, I rather buy great PS4 games. 
I don't mind playing dumb games but god I'd never buy them.

Of course I signed up for Origin Access, and gonna re-get PS Now once on sale, and combined with Humble Monthly and PS+, I'll have all the dumb little games I can handle and so not renewing Gold, and might not even need Game Pass, even if on Win10 store. 
I rather be playing actual good dumb games like Unravel 2, Until Dawn, Hollow Knight, etc.

Leaving Nintendo was as easy as leaving WWE. 
Anytime I enjoy them, they piss the ever living hell out of me for the dumbest shit. 
They are naturally aggravating to me, and feel I'm incapable of casually enjoying them. 
Hence haven't watch WWE in a year and sold Switch like a year ago, but maybe in a year Xbox can tag Switch.","unknown","","34","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.gamespot.com/forums/system-wars-314159282/nintendo-is-the-only-console-maker-i-can-even-hate-33453329/","0","0","","","0","238790839713","","false","","","","","","","0","","71674000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T10:07:23.476+0000","","0.0","4488"

It's been a while but the good news is√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨¬¶.IT'S DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So for not having seemingly much left to do, it sure took a while to get the final details sorted. 
First up was the last of the markings. 
I managed to knock up some semi-passable lettering for the ""Telstars"" markings, stars and the airframe numbers, then I made some masks for the stripes out of frisket film. 
Given that I printed the lettering and had to paint the stripes, colour matching was always going to be an issue, but I got it reasonably close I think.

Here's some of the sheet I made up. 
I even managed to find a picture of the central flying school crest where the Telstars were based, so I was able to resize and add that too.

Trying to work out the exact font was pretty much impossible, but once again ""good enough for government work!""

On to the wheels. 
I wanted to get rid of the centre part while keeping the actual tyre so after I'd cleaned up the outside, I chucked them in the lathe and drilled out the centre.

The step drill worked excellently for this. 
I was worried that with a normal drill bit the heat would build up and start to melt the plastic. 
There was no such issues with the step drill, except that obviously you're locked into specific diameters.

Then I knocked up two hubs made of brass. 
The intent was then to machine them further and add details as required.

To achieve that last step took most of the day. 
Mainly because I had just received a new 4 jaw chuck and rotary table for my mill, but I didn't realise until I went to use it that there was no way to mount the two together. 
So I made this T-bar out of brass to join the two together.

more to come...

So this is what it was all about, almost a whole day to set up and only about 15 minutes to machine each hub. 
The spacing of each of the 6 holes was not quite right but unless you're looking at them closely they'll pass

Sanding a flat on each wheel, I finished them off with some hex heads made using ""the nutter."" 
A little wash and they were done!

Last of all, the canopy was glued on, an antenna added behind the cockpit and the little pipe on the left side for the smoke and I call this one done. 
I apologise for the photos of the finished product at the moment, but hopefully I'll be able to get some more tomorrow in natural light.

All in all, this has been a very enjoyable build. 
Even though the little vampire has many, many mistakes and there is, as always, plenty of things I could have done better, I'm pretty happy with the overall result. 
With each model I build I always try to push the boundaries just a little further, so right now this model represents the pinnacle of my modelling skill. 
A big thank you to all of you that followed along and for everyone who gave advice and comments. 
To everyone participating in this group build, I hope you all manage to finish you current projects as there is some really outstanding work going on here.

Cheers!

Craig

Craig, let me be the first to congratulate you on what I think is a stunning achievement, and a fantastic build. 
You've combined courage, skill and tenacity in equal measures here and produced a winner, irrespective of any mistakes and missteps. 
Great stuff indeed!

Kev

Wonderful, TRULY inspiring work Craig!!

I have also uploaded your finished build to the ABIM GB:

http://forum.largescaleplanes.com/index.php'showtopic=47618&do=findComment&comment=579015

Congrats, on a wonderful build your should be rightly proud!

Bravo, Maestro! 
I give you a standing ovation for this wonderful achievement. 
Riding with you along this project has been a thrilling experience, not only because watching you overcome the obstacles was truly inspiring but because by willingly sharing your solutions with us you have given me (and others, I am sure) ways and ideas to tackle similar issues with our own projects.

Excellent job. 
I love it~! 
Congratulations.

Fabian

PS: Now lets wait and see those ""studio"" shots to follow!!

Thanks so much guys! 
And thank you Brian for posting my not very professional photos in the completed builds thread. 
Being my first GB, I was worried I wouldn't make the cutoff, but in the end it doesn't really matter. 
On the flip side though, it was the thought of a deadline which probably saw this through to completion, so maybe not a bad thing overall. 
What it also did was give me the motivation to actually tackle a project I had only ever thought ""one day"" of starting. 
Thanks very much to whoever came up with the theme for this GB; it served it's purpose well! 
I'll hopefully start another WIP soon, but it's always hard deciding which kit to attack next I do know, however, that with the quality of builds going on on this forum, I going to have to try and keep raising the bar!

Cheers, Craig

Wow, very impressive indeed. 
Good you made it to the finish line. 
And by the way, I'm green with envy seeing your lathe...

Cheers

It launched in Japan in December 2011, right when phone and tablet gaming were taking off -- Sony was trying to sell people on a dedicated handheld at a time when many could play ""good enough"" mobile games on devices they already owned. And while there were high-quality titles like Severed, tepid sales led developers to shy away. Things only got worse when you included design complaints (such as a reliance on expensive, proprietary memory cards) and fierce competition from Nintendo. Sony doesn't plan a sequel to the Vita. That's no surprising at a time when mobile games are still growing, and competition from the Switch could hurt a new entrant's chances. However, it's not exactly in a rush, either. PS4 sales have usually been strong enough to sustain Sony's fortunes, and the company's future may hinge increasingly on PlayStation Now and other cloud services that aren't tied to a single device. Simply speaking, Sony doesn't have the handheld-shaped hole in its lineup that it did several years ago.

I researched the floor and airbrushed it to reflect the carpeting seen on the size set.

I fixed the turbo lift door.

The chairs are there temporarily ...They are inaccurate to the Burkes chaired used in the series...

I corrected the helm as the kit was way off.

The model will feature a screen with a TOS star field, or some planet or something I will film. 
It's kind of just set up for now.

The walls are ""wild"" and simple screwed in so I can add electronics and lighting...

Looks like a stunner so far.

Will you have figures to populate your bridge? 
If memory serves, the three included with the old kit were a little weird in their dimensions. 
I seem recall the 'Sulu' one looking particularly strange....

Yeah, looks fantastic!!! 
I have three of the original boxings I intend to combine into one whenever I get around to it.

I was also wondering if the figures you have in the video are the ones you're using or just stand-ins. 
The figures in mine look horrible. 
I've heard the newer reissue has much better ones. 
A friend swapped his out for some figures from a ST chess set that is pretty close to 1/32nd.

I've grabbed some 1/32nd figures I thought I'd convert. 
But lately I've seen some nice generic fantasy/SF 3D printed figures I thought about ordering and trying to use. 
No way I'd get the figures to look like the actors so I figured I'd do another ship and just make them different Starfleet personnel.

So you're doing the Klingon bridge too??

The more I think about it funny no one has made a garage kit of a Klingon bridge to go with the Enterprise one yet. 
Or the movie era Enterprise and/or the 1701D.

If a Federation personnel ever saw a TOS Klingon bridge, we would have to kill him.

But seriously, my Trek-Fu is weak; I don't ever recall seeing one on the show. 
We did get to see the Romulan bridge though, in ""Balance of Terror"".

Sorry, I'm joking since you have the D-7 on your video. 
Guess it wasn't a very good joke...

Yeah, we didn't really see a Klingon bridge until The Motion Picture.

PS: Now that I think about it I think some of the interior of a Klingon D-7 was shown on the animated show from the '70s. 
Which is generally now considered non-canon.","unknown","","50","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","http://cs.finescale.com/fsm/modeling_subjects/f/6/p/181383/2056354.aspx","0","0","","","0","238742524040","","false","","","","","","","0","","255000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T02:53:47.442+0000","","3.94","151"

The move marks the last step of a long, gradual phase-out that included a halt on first-party games in 2015, the discontinuation of physical games and the end to PS Plus freebies . 
If you're looking for the handheld, you'll either have to get lucky at a retailer (if there are any units left) or track down a second-hand model.

The Vita had a long shelf life, but not a happy one. 
It launched in Japan in December 2011, right when phone and tablet gaming were taking off -- Sony was trying to sell people on a dedicated handheld at a time when many could play ""good enough"" mobile games on devices they already owned. 
And while there were high-quality titles like Severed , tepid sales led developers to shy away. 
Things only got worse when you included design complaints (such as a reliance on expensive, proprietary memory cards) and fierce competition from Nintendo.

Sony doesn't plan a sequel to the Vita. 
That's no surprising at a time when mobile games are still growing, and competition from the Switch could hurt a new entrant's chances. 
However, it's not exactly in a rush, either. 
PS4 sales have usually been strong enough to sustain Sony's fortunes, and the company's future may hinge increasingly on PlayStation Now and other cloud services that aren't tied to a single device. 
Simply speaking, Sony doesn't have the handheld-shaped hole in its lineup that it did several years ago.","unknown","","32","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/02/sony-discontinues-ps-vita/","0","0","","","0","238722919324","","false","","","","","","","0","","32083000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-03T00:38:03.890+0000","","0.0","3985"

I am a variety streamer that streams on Twitch! I imitate random voices while streaming and have a weird sense of humor. I cosplay as a hobby as well but I haven't really done a cosplay stream yet. I have been gaming since I was a kid. Started with the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, Xbox, and Playstation. Now I typically stream on my Xbox One or my PC. My schedule is Thursdays - Sundays PST since I work full time. I have been streaming since August and have a built a pretty positive community of amazing streamers, gamers, etc. Everyone is super nice, supportive, and friendly. I love them! Any time someone subs to my channel, I put on my super extra sunglasses and do a dorky dance. I am a mental health advocate and I have a channel in my discord for emotional support. I genuinely care about the people in my community and I want everyone to know that they can reach out for support if needed. Here is my channel if anyone is interested in checking it out.

It doesn't work. Might be my router, might be Comcast. I go through all the tricks and tips from 3rd party forums, and it still doesn't work. Now the ""This should be illegal"" part. Their website says I can get a refund within 14 days. I spend a half hour filtering through dead links to finally get in contact with someone in chat support. They tell me ""No Refunds"". To add insult to injury, if I didn't put my trust in what has turned out to be a criminal organization, I would have just signed up for the trial and cancelled when it didn't work. I had this service for all of 3 hours before contacting them to cancel, and basically get a ""F you"". Has anyone had any luck getting them to actually abide by their written policy?","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationNow/comments/awn1pm/how_is_this_legal/#595d69bd0.awn1pm","0","0","","","0","238700336866","","false","","","","","","post","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T22:10:57.348+0000","","0.0","4971"

I used to always either accidentally hit them or miss it completely, all the time. When they let us map R2/L2/R3/L3 to the front touch screen for emulated games it got a bit better, but it still wasn‚Äôt good enough. I ended up using my Vita as a remote play device more than playing its own games. Who knows what will happen with the recent MS and Nintendo rumours, but if I was Sony I would get both PlayStation Now and more importantly Remote Play on the Switch if they could.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/awlzng/rip_ps_vita_sony_officially_ends_production/ehnm6tm/#5320f5e24.ehnm6tm","0","0","","","0","238696449350","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T21:46:05.161+0000","","0.0","4971"

CGTN‚Äôs Phil Lavelle reported from Los Angeles. Technology giant, Apple, is reportedly set to launch a games subscription service. The company doesn‚Äôt comment on speculation, but multiple sources have reportedly talked of the world‚Äôs most valuable company having been in discussion with games developers since late last year about a model which would allow users to effectively rent games. It‚Äôs reported that it would run along the same lines as Netflix or Spotify, where users pay a fixed monthly fee and get access to a catalog of TV and films or music, respectively. It‚Äôs not a big surprise, said Samson Amore, Technology Reporter at the Los Angeles Business Journal who points out that Apple is increasingly relying on the services aspect of its business: ‚ÄúI think Apple is getting into a lot of areas that don‚Äôt rely solely on the iPhone‚Äù, he told CGTN. ‚ÄúI think the iPhone X is really expensive right now and people are trying to hang onto it as long as they can without replacing it and that means Apple‚Äôs revenue is gonna slow a little so they‚Äôre trying to find a way to supplement that.‚Äù The company has increasingly been looking to other sources of revenue after a slowdown in iPhone sales. Fewer customers are upgrading their phones annually as prices for most models increase (last year, Apple launched its most expensive models ever) and many are opting to take advantage of Apple‚Äôs battery replacement program. Apple has also seen demand for iPhones fall in China ‚Äì a crucial market. But Apple has been enjoying a huge boom in its services division. Services are elements that customers pay for on either a continuous model (like a monthly payment for iCloud storage, Apple Music streaming or Apple Care insurance) or one off payments (like purchases through the App Store, iTunes Store or Apple Pay.) ‚ÄúThey know investors really love subscriptions.. subscriptions really get investors going when it comes to putting more money into acquisitions or things like that‚Äù Samson added. During the first fiscal quarter of 2019, Apple‚Äôs services segment generated $10.9 billion in revenue. That‚Äôs up more than a billion dollars from the same period 12 months earlier. The App Store itself made over a billion dollars during the 2018 holiday season, with $322 million in just one day: New Years Day. Apple is also reportedly about to launch a news subscription service along similar lines ‚Äì with some claiming it could be launched as early as March (Apple typically announces its big software news in June at an event called WWDC). But when it comes to games, it‚Äôs entering an already busy market. Both Microsoft and Sony have the hardcore gaming market sewn up with their Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now services and Nintendo also has a big presence in the market, thanks to the Switch console which targets both hardcore gamers and those who just dip in and out. Nevertheless, Apple‚Äôs customers have one thing in common: they almost certainly own either an iPhone or an iPad (or both) which gives Apple a bit of an edge, explained Ray Carsillo, a video games journalist. ‚ÄúThey would get a whole new section of gamers that are untapped and are waiting to be catered to‚Äù, he told CGTN. ‚ÄúI think that the impact would be seen on what kinds of exclusive games they get. The only way that this would work ‚Äì and of course, Apple still exploring options, would be what kind of games they can offer on their service exclusively.. What makes Micosoft‚Äôs X-Box GamePass and Sony‚Äôs Playstation Now so successful are the exclusive games they have in their library. If Apple can lure people to develop things exclusively for Apple TV, for the iPhone, for the iPad, suddenly this becomes a more viable service. If they can‚Äôt get the games, the impact will be negligible.‚Äù And so the company that told the world 12 years ago it had reinvented the phone now hopes to ‚Äì apparently ‚Äì reinvent the gaming market. It has its work cut out ‚Äì but it also has more money than most other companies and some small countries. If anyone is able to do it successfully, it‚Äôs likely to be Apple.","unknown","","24","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","https://america.cgtn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sequence-01.00_27_34_16.Still003-770x433.jpg, https://america.cgtn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Owen_3-640x360.jpg","","0","https://america.cgtn.com/2019/03/02/reports-apple-set-to-launch-gaming-subscription-service","0","0","","","0","238686741134","","false","","","","","","","0","","950000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T20:43:27.242+0000","","0.0","521"

If it operates the same way you should be able to access it on the German PS webstore, you should see the PlayStation Now tab that'll take you to the subscription page. From there you should be able to purchase a subscription, if your card doesn't work, you'll have to buy PSN credit from an online seller like cdkeys. Once purchased, you should be good to go. However, these are the things I'm uncertain about: I don't know if you would still be required to add a card even after purchasing a subscription as some sort of verification (would be pretty stupid if so) and I'm not sure if you can change language options from German in games.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationNow/comments/aw9d2e/question_about_the_region_of_ps_now_account_vs/ehnfnya/#595d69bd0.ehnfnya","0","0","","","0","238683562251","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T20:23:26.573+0000","","0.0","4971"

Suddenly I understood how the mechanics worked, and I flew through the game with my trusty Lightning Zweihander until Gwyn. Gwyn beat me down repeatedly for days. Eventually, in my frustration, I finally looked at the Wiki only to realize that the one thing he is resistant to was lightning. ‚Äã Fast forward several years, and having beaten DS2, and losing access to a decent PC, I haven't had my Soulsborne itch scratched in a while, and my roommate finally bought Bloodborne. My girlfriend loves watching the game, so she encouraged me to finally try Bloodborne. I picked it up and immediately fell in love. The world, the level design, the boss, THE SCORE. (Side note, I get rock hard anytime I hear the Cleric Beast theme.) I found out that Ludwig's Holy Blade functions like the Zweihander, and boy, I was back at it. Bosses were falling left and right. ‚Äã Eventually, I ended up switching to streaming the game to my PC via PS Now so that my roommate could use his PS4. (Another side note: Don't listen to people who say that PS Now is garbage. I played through easily 60-75% of the game, including PVP on it, and it rocks.) I found out about the Moon Presence fight, and knew I had to beat it. Last weekend, I finally finished all the optional bosses, and all I had left was Mergo's Wet Nurse, and the last two. Mergo put up no fight, and suddenly, it was time to fight the First Hunter. I readied myself, (farming for blood vials is a fucking chore) and entered the garden. ‚Äã Gehrman's quick reflexes and fast dashing forced me out of my greatsword comfort. I could no longer R1 spam. I had to think, and use every bit of combat knowledge I had, but it wasn't good enough. He kept shooing me away like the hungry dog I was. I could come close, and Gehrman would decide that he was done playing around and end it. I was frustrated. This ending would not coming. I debated rolling back my save, but no, I could not let the beasthood claim me. ‚Äã Today, I woke up and swore that Gehrman would die. I steeled myself, and fought tooth and nail, and finally, when all seemed darkest (ala, I had no health vials or QS bullets), I finally landed the hit that would claim the life of the First Hunter. Should I have? Why should I, an outsider, force an end to this hunt? ‚Äã Now that I've gotten my expositing out of the way, holy shit, Gehrman was so fucking difficult, but it might be my favorite fight in all of Soulsborne to date. He rivals Artorias in my book. The score makes you realize just how powerful the First Hunter truly is. He holds his title with reason. ‚Äã Now I make my way to Dark Souls 3, but the hunt will always call me back.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/awlc33/spoiler_what_is_it_with_final_bosses_in_this/#588986bf1.awlc33","0","0","","","0","238675220817","","false","","","","","","post","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T19:30:57.239+0000","","0.0","4971"

The main idea is that the games are not running on your own computer or console, but instead running on servers and then streamed to your device, so you can potentially play games with very high hardware requirements on devices that aren't that powerful. So the ""service"" is that they're running the game for you on their own hardware.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/awk3wo/eli5_what_does_games_as_a_service_mean/ehn2q25/#559d54392d.ehn2q25","0","0","","","0","238658502076","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T17:45:40.012+0000","","0.0","4971"

Within 2 weeks l'd had my ct scan and re started chemo. 
This time Carbo/Gem for recurrence after only 9 months. 
How l hated walking into the chemo suite once again! 
Well, they were all great, even recognising me with my hair :). 
They have a new machine to warm your hand. 
It's like a plastic sleeve which blows warm air for 3/4 minutes. 
Great, it did the trick as they got the needle straight in. 
Long may this work for me, as l am reluctant/afraid to have a port. 
Daft l know as many of you have written to say you would not be without one.

Only slight change to original plans seems to be that they have decided to give me both chemo's every time, instead of carbo/gem then gem alone. 
Schedule is 2 weeks of treatment, then one weeks rest. 
Results of the ct scan have initiated this. 
One session down, 11 to go. 
Then hoping for a PARB or trial. 
Fingers crossed l tolerate this, l did really well last time, never missed a single week, except for the three weeks after my op.

Then we shall immediately re book our holiday, treating my hubby to some normal time. 
On wards and upwards.

Have a good weekend everyone and stay strong. 
X

Hello again,

So glad they rushed you into treatment and I hope this treatment is not too rough for you and that you get to keep your new hair.

Like you, I also was pleased, when I returned to the Chemo Suite, that people recognised me with my new hair - plus, like you, I was soooo very ill the first time round, I could barely walk, but 6 months later I was nearly my old optimistic energetic self!

Now I go in with 2 jovial lady friends who entertain me during treatment and get me snacks!

This treatment I am on takes about 4 hours.

How long is yours?

PS: now I almost wish I had not got this hideous Port. 
It makes infusion easier, but was such a horror inserting it, and is so ugly, but I will hesitate to have it removed...

However, I am going on the PARP Niraparib sometime in April and I pray to the powers that be, that it keeps me in remission for my new forever.

And the same for you.

Hugs,

Laura

Hello Laura, I just wanted to say how much I like your kind, caring and very wise responses to everyone. 
You reassured me when I just joined the forum a few weeks ago and I see you doing the same for many others, your positive and upbeat approach keeps me going. 
I hope you keep on posting and wish you all the best in the future. 
Thank you

love

Pat

Hi Laura, this new treatment took approx 4 hours start to finish. 
Luckily l live only 20mins from the hospital, driving a short country route from my home. 
Passing by a field, with a couple of donkeys which always make me smile.

The hospital installed a new parking payment method over Christmas - vehicle reg id. 
This for me is an improvement as it means on the days you get chemo, parking is free. 
Previously it was free only if you parked in a certain car park and it was always full! 
Reason being it is very close to the hospital. 
I am always shocked by how people with nothing wrong, like staff and visitors will not walk any distance. 
I am the type of person who will walk when well and take the stairs not the lift etc. 
I joined the Ramblers in the summer and look forward to returning asap, l very much enjoyed both the company and the lovely walks.

p.s I managed to get to Esk hause which is on the way to Scafell Pike in the Lake District back last September, 4 months after completing last lot of chemo. 
Hope to attempt this again later this year. 
Hence l was so shocked when offered a blue badge!","unknown","","23","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://healthunlocked.com/ovacome/posts/140172161/back-on-treatment-hey-ho","0","0","","","0","238647443455","","false","","","","","","","0","","900000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T16:41:20.182+0000","","0.0","496"

I always make notes, well more often than not but I've yet to come across a player on Full Tilt or PokerStars where I've made a note on them.

I have come across ""noted"" players on PKR though and the notes have proved very useful and won me some serious pots.

I'm guessing that because there are so many players on FT and PS, it will be rare to bump into any of my noted players...who are plentiful!

Have you ever ""bumped"" into any of your noted players and if so, did the notes help or were you just ranting about how crap they were at playing?

blue use notes is very useful i had tons of players marked in my PS Account and my PKR account and always give me a hint to play againts this players thats a extra help to made a decision and play a hand! 
;) 8) Notes are very complicated and not used properly by most players, myslef included.

A note is worthless if its something like 3 bet from big blind.

A good note should include the date, stakes and exact information like board cards and so on.

However, i feel that taking notes online is a bit overrated in games where you dont come across players as much. 
I think a tag will suffice for the most part. 
This way you will have instant notification if a player is bad, good etc. On FT I would tag all the bad players green and the good ones blue i believe. 
It was rare to across one on big sites. 
But, on the sites I play on these days, notes are well worth taking since I see the same players almost every day.

I think if you use HEM or PT you should be fine and will get the same effect as a note would do if not better. 
You can buy HH from sites I will not name. 
I bought 1 million hands once and the very next time I played on this site , I had at least 3k hands on every player at the table with some reaching 20k hands. 
This made my HEM more powerful than ever and worth more than a note I took months ago would ever be.

I think if you notice a good player, it would be best to tag them sinmce more likely you will see them versus a bad player who will lose their money and not be able to play Where colours are available I use them and for particlar games too. 
On FT, Rush players are always mauve and I make no notes on them. 
In other games, it's Red for bad players, Green for good players and in both red and green, the hands they call with. 
PS now dates notes which is pretty useful too.

I'm still waiting for the day I bump into a person I made a note on at PS and FT though.","unknown","","15","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.latestpokerbonuses.com/forum/poker/so-you-made-a-note-did-you-ever-play-them-again/?action=printpage;PHPSESSID=nefplhde9ctt3va02rh9to96u1","0","0","","","0","238632998713","","false","","","","","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T15:17:24.804+0000","","0.0","0"

I guess you don't see the many discounts you get for Vue, PS Now & PS Video being a PS+ subscriber? Gamers sure do! Epix only became a major player in the last yr or so as another ""premium"" content supplier to rival HBO, Showtime, Starz, Encore...and prolly others I'm forgetting. Its only been a month they've been available as a stand-alone...give them time. Why would Sony roll back their prices? They are competitive compared to other services and like the rest are likely already losing money in the short term to establish their customer base. You have to consider Sony as big as they are, entered this fray with NOTHING previous and had to negotiate agreements with all the providers with no basis except projections and estimates....which obviously Sony banked on. Sling had DISH, DTVNow had DTV, Hulu had their base SVOD #'s, Google is really the only other one starting raw with YTTV. Sony is TRYING to make a profit, at the same time they launched a service trying to compete with cable and other national streaming players....Sony has done quite well considering.","unknown","","59","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/youtube-tv-reportedly-tops-1-million-subscribers/#comment-4361303145","0","0","","","0","238660837776","","false","","","","","","","0","","376000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T17:59:40.651+0000","","5.57","220"

The only problem is since the PS5 is already making waves, is it too late to start?

PS5 is rumoured to be backwards compatible with PS4 and PS3 so id say wait a bit until it's confirmed. 
Also majority of the great games from the PS3 era have been remastered or are available on ps now. 
If you have the connection to support it, it's definitely a great service.

You can purchase a used slim with controllers and games for around $100. 
That‚Äôs a great deal.

Short answer: it‚Äôs never too late.

It's never too late. 
If anything, no better time than now. 
I don't think we'll be getting anymore PS3 games, so you have an entire library of games that are dirt cheap right now. 
Once the PS5 comes out, many PS3 games will start to rise in price.

there's a massive library of games for the ps3. 
most are under 20$ apiece new or used. 
as for used consoles only advice is to avoid gamestop seems there is a higher risk of obtaining a bad one.

slim or super slim is the way to go.

If you want to check out some single player games I would say go for it! 
Ps3 has some AWESOME games. 
A great game will always be a great game. 
It's never too late. 
If you want to check out Ps3 for Multiplayer games I would say skip it. 
Only reason is because a lot of the servers have already shut down. 
You won't get the full experience of these games. 
Or even worse! 
Games that are ONLINE ONLY! 
Unable to play them at all. 
You'll be stuck with a bunch of awesome brick games such as Warkhawk, Mag, SoCom etc... But it's really up to you.

I'm looking forward to see if the PS5 will support PS3 games. 
I highly doubt so, since Sony sits on a comfortable position in this generation, but who knows.

Would be nice to play old games without pushing a 2006 console to its limits (mine is noisy as f****) and with decreased loading times.

If the PS5 is released without backwards compatibility, I believe that it's only a matter of time till Sony shuts down PS3 network, trophy system etc.

Hmm. Kinda lost here.

Too late for what?

If you are into the last trend, if you look for amazing graphics, if for you new stuff is 200% more important than old, Then it is probably a little late.

Otherwise you have a console with a huge library of titles. 
Most of them very cheap, online is free. 
It is not late.

In some way it could be late when Sony decides to shut down all servers for ps3 games (if some day happens).

Too late for ps plus free games perhaps but never too late for the console itself. 
I bought mine along with ps4 having used primarily xbox 360 last gen. 
But be advised that sony stopped manufacturing dualshock 3 about 2 years back. 
So if your gamepad is broken your only option is third party hardware. 
Other than that a worthy console. 
I would get just for collection

Personally, I'd probably cry if my PS3 when into the light - maybe even replace it with a used one. 
So, even tho quite a few of the games have been remastered, I'm still in love with the old console.

Not really too late, it is a question of risk reward at this point. 
We have to accept that there are countless ps3 games that will never be available on the ps4, not remastered and not in psnow. 
The question is, if you really want to play some or all of these games, do you take path 1 or path 2.

Path 1 is you buying a ps3 for cheap now, and cheap old ps3 games you can play on it. 
The console is not all that expensive, and the games aren't either. 
The advantage is that you definitely get the console and you can play your games on it. 
The reward is clear, the risk is the following. 
Ps3 consoles can break down easily due to their age and maybe the ps5 will be fully backwards compatible, in which case the investment into the console was really bad because you have the ps5 then, making the ps3 entirely useless and hard to resell. 
On the other hand, you bought the games before their price increased, so this is probably the most balanced approach if there are MANY games you want to buy on the ps3. 
The more games, the less relevant are the potentially wasted cost from the console itself.

Path 2 is more risky. 
It means you buying only the the ps3 games, not the console. 
The games are cheap now and will get more expensive due to demand should the ps5 be officially announced as backwards compatible with ps3 games. 
If the ps5 is backwards compatible, you just bought a ton of games for cheap before they increased in price, if the ps5 is not backwards compatible, you have to buy a more expensive ps3 because then they are in higher demand due to people realising that this console will be the only way to play certain games for eternity. 
You may save the ps3 console cost entirely, but you could just as easily end up having to pay it in the end, and then some.

You could of course just buy neither and wait until you know that the ps5 is backwards compatible. 
In this case you only have to buy the games, should not be impossible to snatch a few games from people who played through and wanted to sell them back quickly, and maybe the ps store has great prices for ps3 games, who knows. 
However if the ps5 is not backwards compatible and you have bought neither console or games, then you pay much more for a while, but this demand will die down after a while, so this can be a good approach if you are really patient.

if you want to play a ton of ps3 games, definitely pick 1. 
The cost of the console pales in comparison to what you are getting out of it and save on the games. 
Take your time and pick the best offers, maybe you find someone who wants to sell the console and a big collection for a great price. 
I will never get a ps3, I pretty much promised myself that so I hope the ps5 is backwards compatible and I will then just wait patiently on good sales for the few ps3 games I really want to play.

I hope physical PS3 games will download an updated version for the PS5. 
Similar to what Xbox is doing right now with their BC. 
Their RDR1 shit for Xbox One X is goddamn INCREDIBLE, and definitely something that I would love to see Sony outright copy.

It should become the industry standard.

Let me play Final Fantasy XIII-2 with textures that are of this decade, dammit. 
It looks piss poor on my 55"" Sony X900F.

If its just to purely play games and you are not worried about getting Platinum/100% then its never too late to start, you can easily pick up a PS3 really cheap. 
The main problem if you are after getting Platinum is if the game has online trophies because a lot of these games will be pretty much dead online unless its a COD or FIFA type game. 
I still have games in my PS3 library I need to get round to playing at some point. 
Go for it

I beg you - please dont talk about backwards compatibility.

It was one of the greatest announcments for the ps4 - that it could read ps2 and ps3 games. 
Only a few weeks before the ps4 was released, they said that it wont be available at the start - but there will come a patch that gives us the backwards compatibility.

A few months later sony announced, that there will never be a backwards compatibility.

And this was the start of a new Business - the Remastered and Remake-Business.

I'm sure, they will bring us most of the ps4 titles in the store - to buy it for the ps5 again.

Like they did it on the ps4 as well.

But please - buy a ps3, its really cheap meanwhile - dont think about the backwards compatibility in the future. 
This wont happen.

I've taken all of what you've all said into consideration. 
Gonna be doing at least 1 game for each system for every plat I get. 
Thanks again for the feedback. 
Got me a PS3 for $40 that came with a few games. 
So I'm gonna start with that.

I picked up a bunch of used PS3 games and I'm going though them now. 
I was a PS1 and 2 kid, but got a 360 that gen, but have come back home to the PS family. 
I'm swapping back and forth between my PS3 and PS4 and have had no issues doing so. 
That said, if PS5 does indeed come with PS3 and PS4 backwards compatibility, then the system will be day one for me, if not, I may wait until the list of games I have for these two is a little smaller.

Personally i got a PS3 in 2016. 
I was an Xbox 360 gamer during the 7th gen. 
I regret having taken my sweet time to play some of these games. 
I should had focuss more on the PS3 the last 2 and a half year but it is what it is. 
I still have many great titles to play on the machine and im mostly looking only at exclusives...

The factors in getting a PS3 now are...

1) Most games have multiplayer servers down, and if they are still up, there mostly empty unless its Call of Duty, making it either impossible or very hard to unlock the multiplayer trophies.

2) PS3 Servers going offline may be a thing... nothing heard from Sony so far and i do think they would announce it well in advance, but you never know. 
If it happen it may block earning trophies...

But personally i think PS3 and 360 games are holding up just fine...

I have gone thru to the rule process for ""Rules applied WHEN folder is opened"". 
If I leave the computer on with Pegasus running,so the folder is already opened.

If the reply is sent when the folder is ""when opened"", then I am not on vacation any more. 
;)

Is there a place for ""Rules applied WHILE the folder is opened"" ?

Thanks

I have tried leaving the New Mail folder open. 
The emails I am trapping are for a convention I am involved in. 
From my personal email I send to the convention email address. 
I see my personal email show up in the New folder but never receive the ""vacation email"" back to my personal. 
I've waited for 15 minutes, hitting send/recv on my personal email. 
And it didn't go to my junk/spam folder. 
And in PegMail I hit the ""send/receive"" button to make sure the output queue is empty. 
I never see at the bottom the message of ""1 queued email"".

I'm assuming you are using the filter action that sends a text message since that is the only way that comes to mind that could work as an auto-reply from a filter. 
When it's working you should see a message being sent immediately follow one being received that triggers the rule. 
I don't queue messages so don't know if the sends will get queued when it is enabled.

Try setting the 'contains' field to just ""texasstarparty"" or ""tsprooms"" (no quotes).

Also, are there any other rules above this one that might be preventing the message from reaching this rule?

I'm heading out of town shortly and will be unavailable until Sunday night or Monday morning.

I have tried various versions of tsprooms and texasstarparty, still no luck. 
This is the only rule I have created.

Just doesn't make sense why this doesn't work.

Again, thanks for the help and staying with me.

From scratch, the process should be:

Tools > Mail filtering rules > Edit new mail filtering rules > Rules applies when folder is opened. 
The 'New mail filtering rules' window should be open

If the only rule listed is the one you've been trying to get working, delete it. 
If there are others, you'll need to determine they're value, but for now we'll place the vacation rule at the top followed by an Exit processing rule to insure none of the other rules are acting on the message.

Click one the first rule then click the 'Add rule' button. 
If they're aren't any, just click the 'Add rule"" button.

In the ""Create a new filtering rule' window click the 'Headers...' button

In the ""Edit standard header rule' window select the 'To' option then in the 'Contains text' box type ""tsprooms"" (no quotes). 
The 'Exact match' option should not be checked.

For the Action option select 'Set message colour', click the 'Set' button and pick a color. 
The bottom two options should be unticked.

Click OK.

Now click the ""Add rule"" button again. 
Click the 'Always trigger' button and set the Action to 'Exit this rule set'. 
Click OK.

Your top two rules should now be:

Headers T contains 'tsprooms' Set colour to...

Always Exit this rule set

If they're in reverse order, click on the top one to select it, then click the rgreen down arrow in the window header to move the rule position down.

Click Save. 
Click Close.

You're done.

To test, make sure you have a message in the new mail folder that contains 'tsprooms' in the To: field. 
Mark it as unread if it isn't.

Close then reopen your new mail folder. 
The 'tsprooms' message should now be colored.

GOT IT WORKING!

The ""operator issue"" was that after setting up the rule, not hitting the Save & Close buttons.

First pass got message to change color.. Second pass got the ""sending address"" to receive the ""out on vacation"" message.

Whewww... Case closed.

THANKS AGAIN for staying with me on this.

Steve

PS: Now to disable until we really leave town.

I have many From Software games, simply love Otogi and Frame Gride as well. So I recently got gifted a PS3 and a 360 for doing some hack/mod jobs as payment. The 360 came with Dark Souls and I went and scooped up Demon Souls and Dark Souls 2 but for the life of me I just can't get into them like Bloodborne. I have gotten pretty good at Dark Souls but haven't picked up Demon Souls and I got pretty far in Dark Souls 2 till my system got stolen. I'm simply craving Bloodborne though. Looked into PS Now but alas no OSX support and I can't use a VM or Bootcamp as this Mac Book belongs to the law firm. So I desperately wanted to love the Souls games but they feel slow and clunky compared to my found memories of Bloodborne. I recall when I bought it I kept getting my arse handed to me over and over but couldn't put it down and finally one day it clicked and I as they say ""Git Gud"" I just fell in love with the game. Never have I been so immersed in a game. It's all I played even having so many games I hadn't played yet. I just wanted different builds and new ways to play the game. So it leads me to where I am now, wanting to dive into more Souls games I just can't even come close to the feeling I had playing that game. I live vicariously through the post here waiting for the day I can get another PS4 once I'm able to go back to work. Does anyone else have this problem with the other games in the series??","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/awc278/anyone_else_just_find_dark_souls_a_bore/#588986bf1.awc278","0","0","","","0","238529170078","","false","","","","","","post","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T02:55:02.391+0000","","0.0","4971"

When the biggest games in the world, Fortnite and Minecraft, already operate this way you have to question the logistics.

Another way of looking at it is that Game Pass is ¬£7 per month, so over the 5 year span of a generation that alone is going to cost more than a console outright.

I think one of my points is that eventually there will be no need for expensive and powerful hardware. 
It costs a ton for them to produce it and then they dont make much of a profit anyways. 
In some cases they're making losses in an attempt to plug software to people. 
They've got to be thinking of ways around that.

I've used Vita Remote Play from living room to bedroom to run patrols and other low difficulty stuff in Destiny 1. 
It was fine, but also felt lumpier. 
There's no way I'd have tried anything hard. 
I tried the PS Now after I got a free trial - played one of the Force Unleashed games. 
Now admittedly, they've got lumpy controls to start with, but there the latency just left everything feeling ""off"" as well. 
I don't think of myself as someone who notices frame rates, input lag and things - I'm not a hugely hardcore gamer that complains about 60fps and the like. 
But the two streaming things I've tried both felt materially worse than playing natively. 
So I'm pretty sceptical.

It'll get better, of course. 
But what breaks my heart (for some weird reason) is when people play SMK on a SNES Mini and blame their aging on poor driving skills. 
It only takes minuscule amounts of latency to put you into drink-driving territory with that game. 
For the record SMK took me the longest time to adapt to out of all of the games on there. 
:/

Yeah, but another thing I forgot to mention is allowing you to use the main console and the streaming device at the same time for different things. 
So, for example, my girlfriend can be watching Netflix on the main Xbox while I‚Äôm streaming a game from it upstairs. 
I don‚Äôt think you can do that at the moment, can you?

Nope. 
It probably won't have the horsepower to run a game that's pushing and then also pump out a stream to you plus decode an incoming stream probably.

You're effectively wanting straight game streaming. 
Or if you're playing Ms first party games you may as well use Win 10 Game stroe and play that same game locally since they're all play anywhere now.

Nope.

Or not, seeing as I‚Äôm on Mac. 
I suppose I could install Windows on a partition on that, if I really wanted. 
Like I said, no real need though because I‚Äôve got Xboxes everywhere currently. 
Ah well, it was just a thought!

In theory, it could render at a higher resolution when there's less motion on screen, such as when the camera isn't moving and the eye is more able to pick out the detail. 
That extra detail can be rendered late because static things aren't time sensitive.

You're referring to a separate idea that Microsoft's R&D came up with, that was more about doing fancier graphics for mobile devices. 
The supposed streaming Scarlett box that was originally rumoured did collision detection locally, that is supposed to be the breakthrough development to fix latency.

Though since then, the rumours about Scarlett don't actually mention it anymore, now they only talk about an Xbox One X equivalent entry level machine and a replacement for the Xbox One X:

According to our sources, there are two consoles currently being prepped, aiming for a 2020 holiday debut ‚Äî a cheaper ""S""-style console, to succeed the Xbox One S, and a more beastly ""X""-style console, to succeed the Xbox One X. 
The codename for the ""S 2"" seems to be ""Lockhart,"" and the codename for the ""X 2"" seems to be ""Anaconda,"" which may also be serving as a dev kit.

The next-gen Lockhart console will be the affordable SKU, providing the next-gen Xbox experience in a package potentially around as powerful as the current Xbox One X hardware wise, with refinements under the hood. 
The Anaconda console will be more powerful and more expensive, providing a cutting-edge console gaming experience. 
We've also heard Microsoft is exploring technology to dramatically reduce loading times, potentially including SSD storage in the package.

Windowscentral have a really useful summary of the potential solutions Microsoft's xCloud project might use to fix the latency problem, their R&D team is even trying to make Cloud-VR happen, and that is the most latency sensitive application out there!:

Using Doom 3 as an example, the Kahawai tool managed to cut the bandwidth required to stream the game over a 1MB line by more than 80 percent while avoiding major cuts in visual quality. 
All this occurs while eliminating the delay usually associated with cloud gaming.

A recent report also detailed additional moves to clamp down on latency, ""predicting"" player actions in real time. 
Leveraging deep learning advancements, it appears Microsoft plans to anticipate inputs before they're made, while seamlessly correcting inaccuracies as they occur.

There's another side to the lag issue also, because however much the lag can be reduced, there has to be something there because the game is running on a remote system, so it isn't possible to eliminate the lag 100% .

They can do what is in their power to reduce it, but they don't have any control of, for example, your system at home. 
If you're using the TV I nearly bought from John Lewis 3 years ago, the one that has 8ms lag, and if you're connecting that TV to your router with slow power line adaptors then there's nothing your streaming provider can do about that and their extra bit of lag could be the straw that breaks the camels back.

Having family members that watch SD channels on their HD TVs in the wrong aspect ratio whilst playing a 2.0 stereo feed into a 5.1 system, I'm happy that, at least initially, the lag issue wouldn't bother most people. 
But just as Guitar Hero educated a lot of people about lag (having to calibrate the game based on your TVs response rate), I think the lag issue would be something that would become a known issue as people start to ask themselves why they have become rubbish at playing. 
I consider myself a bit of an expert on Gradius 5 for example , but on that old Samsung DLP I could barely get through a couple of levels. 
I'd imagine playing it on a streaming service to be equally bad, but if I happened to be streaming it to that old TV as well it wouldn't even be worth trying to play it.

Apart from being totally unreliable and bulky, it had a screen lag that totally did my head in. 
The upscaler in the TV was a little slow. 
Setting the DVD player, games console etc. to output 720p meant that the TV displayed the image just fine but anything that wasn't 720p (SD, component Wii, rf, scart) would be upscaled by the TV to 720p and it would take time to do it. 
This meant that the audio (from my amp) was slightly ahead of the image and I could tell from this that the TV was to blame. 
However with video games it was just a weird experience. 
At first, I didn't notice the issue, but I felt that I'd lost my skills. 
Suddenly I was crap at games. 
After a while, I played arcade action titles and realised that Mario jumped just after I pressed the button and this meant that anything involving timing became really tricky. 
With the help of Guitar Hero, I isolated that the TV was mere frames behind, but this tiny difference had a profound effect on the games. 
Obviously fast arcade reaction games were completely ruined, but I was surprised at the effect on everything I tried. 
Platform games had a feel of those ice levels they used to do all the time, with the character falling off a platform you'd already reacted to. 
You'd shoot someone but they'd have moved out of the way by the time you'd pressed the button.

This for me thinking about streaming services. 
They seem to be the next big thing with PS Now, Antstream, Apple, Shadow, all making claims to be producing the best thing ever and I'd be interested in seeing this happen. 
But I know that once you notice the lag, you can see it all the time and lag became a huge bugbear for me, ruining every game I played because I knew it was there. 
Even games you wouldn't think would be affected became sluggish and felt, just wrong, in a way that was really hard to explain. 
Even doing a Sodoku game felt like a poor experience, and I'd suspect that little puzzle apps are probably the least lag-dependant games available.

So the idea of streaming, using a cheap, basic setup at home to receive stunning 4K resolutions etc sounds amazing to me, but there seems to be this elephant in the room where these services are all suggesting they have the technology to eliminate lag and make a streaming service that is every bit as good as playing the way we do know. 
I don't believe this, and I don't see how that can be possible. 
Lag can be reduced, sure. 
But whatever the streaming service promises they can only improve at their end. 
You have all your wiring in your house that they cannot affect, and of course between you and them is the internet. 
Even a few frames is enough to have a massively negative effect on the experience.

The drive to create these new streaming platforms appears to be driven by companies seeing the success of Netflix and realising that there is a lot of money to be made, rather than being driven by a need or demand for the service. 
I'm wondering, is streaming ever going to be a viable replacement for what we have now?

Although I remain skeptical about how well it can be done, I'm still in favour of companies giving it a go. 
I think the forthcoming Antstream will be quite interesting - an entirely streamed selection of retro games from an era where rapid reflexes were hugely important. 
If Antstream can pull that off, I'll be impressed, because the challenge it faces isn't any easier just because the graphics are low fi. 
The graphics are not the problem.

My first playthrough of Alien Isolation was done using Steam Home Streaming, purely because I didn't have a long enough HDMI lead at the time to hook my PC up to my telly in the same room. 
It was an absorbing, terrifying and utterly amazing experience for all the right reasons, and it was only later when I played it natively that I realised there was a noticeable lag involved making Amanda's movement seem heavy and considered. 
It didn't impact my enjoyment of the game.

If a streaming solution's lag is of that level (and many individuals report that they don't notice the issue when they're playing) then streaming has a future. 
Whether it can be applied to all games is another matter. 
As I only owned one Xbox One controller, I used to play PES 2016 against my mate by streaming to a PC so I could hook up a 360 pad. 
The bone controller was hooked directly, the output to the TV was from the console, and the PC was only used as a gateway for the second controller. 
Hence, there was a clear delay in button presses being registered compared to the native controller, and on a game that relies a lot on fast response to your input, the effects were noticeable enough to be detrimental. 
And this was on a local network - not pinged to some online server.

Longer term I'd have concerns about the ability for enthusiasts to preserve games. 
Say we move to an all-streaming approach in the next decade. 
In another thirty years, are those games going to be readily available if nobody but streaming companies ever had a copy of the game?

It's no different to video streaming in that respect, but I suppose considering the bulk of (paying) customers are happy to stick with standard definition DVD, streaming is actually an improvement over that but inferior to massive bitrate BD.

Game streamings happening, even if people don't want it to. 
The lure of all those people on mobile and Smart TVs is too much to resist. 
Though they could at least architect games actually designed to be streamed, rather than retrofit the existing game design paradigms.

I‚Äôve had great game streaming over a piddly ADSL connection but I haven‚Äôt been able to get my 100Mbps, fairly low latency wifi broadband to stream right since someone set up a new router three doors away. 
I find it it surprising and strange that lag is always mentioned as the main and only barrier to making game streaming viable. 
Aren't places like the UK and the USA (two pretty major markets) rife with draconian download caps even in 2019? 
Aren't major parts of those countries not yet serviced by a decent connection? 
How many more countries are in the same situation, and how does stuff like ending net neutrality the United States of Trumponia affect the viability of streaming for a large enough audience?

There's a lot of variable in making it work well enough. 
Some of which are at the customer end. 
There's also bandwidth caps to consider even if a player has internet of the correct speed.

Given that both MS and Google are heavily investing in the tech and the rumour is that MS plan to launch some kind of service this year I'd be surprised not to see it getting a big push over the next few years (And likely mostly at the start of whatever the next gen turns out to be).

I've had mixed experiences with it so far. 
I couldn't even activate a PSNow trial since Sony deemed my 32meg connection wasn't fast enough (Their speedtest said I had six meg) and yet that same week I was happily playing Bloodborne on my friend's PS4 over the same connection via shareplay.

I'd rather have the games playing natively but if they get the tech to a point where it's worth it for a large proportion of the games it could be a viable option in some circumstances. 
At work and fancy playing some Destiny? 
Break out that Switch, get on the work wifi and launch your XBox Gamepass app

I played Arkham City via GeForce Now over a 25 meg mobile connection, which is the best I could get locally. 
Free to Shield owners for a bit. 
Software detection targeted 720p but could get a little blurry at times. 
Occassional annoying complete drops were a bigger issue than responsiveness.

Eliminate those and have a decent selection of games and I'd happily pay a Netflix style fee for access. 
But I couldn't see my using it as my sole gaming system. 
Some people might though, itll depend on your tolerance for technical imperfections / desired for hitting the really top end and what games you are into. 
But it'll definitely be part of the mix, convenience will make it worthwhile for a lot of people aside from anything else.

I don't think streaming is really about countries with high console ownership in the first place, if you consider that even with every single person accounted for, you aren't even half-way to reaching 2 Billion potential customers appealing to people in those countries.

I think you need to think outside the box on this one and view it not from an existing gaming customer POV.

This is what I expect also. 
As long as they offer both options, everybody should be happpy. 
If, at a certain point streaming is the only way to play new games then I've got enough older titles waiting to be played in my backlog to last me a hundred years easy.

That's exactly what I'm doing though, yer existing average gamer will likely have a decent connection and be willing to pay to get around download caps. 
For people outside of that audience, be that in the UK or USA, or outside those traditional countries where the current state of the network may very well be similarly bad, how big of a roadblock will this be? 
Streamed games are going to compete directly with the popularity of YouTube and Netflix et al for the limited and precious download cap allowance. 
Maybe I'm talking nonsense, but I'm wondering whether this could be a potential roadblock. 
Note that I'm making assumptions on the state of USA and UK connectivity based on the amount of complaining I read in here and in other places.

A while back, I watched my nephews playing Fortnite on a TV setup with massive latency. 
I found it absolutely, completely unplayable; they didn't give a shit. 
And they were doing totally fine in the game too. 
I've played streaming services - even years back - that delivered smaller latency than that bloody TV setup. 
Which makes me think that streaming services have a good shot at working out for a lot of players, though there will always be people for who it's a total no-go. 
(I also fully expect to see stream-players viewed as casuals by local hardware players in the future, who call themselves the master race, etc)

It's more an additive product than a replacement product at this point in time. 
They specifically talk about making it work well with mobile data networks and how streaming will allow big console-style games to reach a bigger audience, as existing mobile and PC online games are already reaching a pretty big audience as-is.

Data caps could indeed be a problem for uptake in certain parts of the world.

Yup. It's going to be akin to the people who play retro and insist they use CRT to the 90% of other retro gamers that give zero fucks they're playing on non CRT Tv's.

A future? Sure. 
The future? 
I don't know... the bandwidth involved seems like it would be a bit of a luxury until connections get more efficient and cheaper. 
Besides, weren't we supposed to be against an always-online world back in 2013?

Yup. It's going to be akin to the people who play retro and insist they use CRT to the 90% of other retro gamers that give zero fucks they're playing on non CRT Tv's.

I don't really see that as the main barrier. 
Even if people are willing to tolerate touch controls over a proper controller, tiny text and visuals etc. the real problem will be having a connection stable enough for it to actually work and not eat up all their data, and that's before we even consider the price of a subscription. 
Sure, for us lot who play games all the time and are enthusiasts of the medium, it's great value, but for those who just play Minecraft, Fortnite or whatever it might not be.

Worth keeping in mind that all the rumours indicate that Microsoft is aiming to get two next-gen Xboxes out there: one Xbox One X style fancy powerful box that plays all the latest and greatest locally, and one cheap streaming Xbox without a disc drive. 
So whoever is worried about streaming being the future of ALL gaming, probably doesn't need to worry for at least another 7 to 8 years. 
And maybe both options - local and streaming - will coexist even in the generation after that.

I really don't see the point of that streaming Xbox. 
Surely the point of streaming, the only real reason to use it, is to bypass hardware entirely to reach customers who aren't buying consoles.

Different price points will entice different people to jump in.

Full fat - Full price

Streaming box - middle for those who don't own the other consoles maybe?

Software only solution for people who already have the other consoles that it can run on

Software only solution for people who own no consoles and arent even in the gaming market that can play on tablet or phone.

they all have a different appetite for latency/price and what they want to play.

Will it though? 
I mean no doubt it will be cheaper, but if they're going to be streaming the same games to smart phones and TV's anyway it seems pointless to me.

A streaming-only console would presumably be something like a Chromecast or Amazon Fire stick, bundled with a pad and a headset. 
Would be handy for taking on holiday, if nothing else.

I think it's an experiment worth trying. 
The streaming box MIGHT have something in it to do some local stuff. 
Who knows?

If it doesn't work out then they've still got the full fat box or software only strands of the strategy to plow on with.

Feels like a sensible risk mitigation.

People who don't buy consoles till they get to under a ¬£100 maybe? 
Or people who just don't buy games right now? 
Or people who don't game very often and the streaming solution is the cheaper option for them to get instant access to stuff when they do fancy dipping in here and there.

But if it needs local processing to work more efficiently don't you then have to question how good the service will be? 
You're not gonna reach 2 billion customers by selling them a box.

Like I said. 
I don't know what the box will contain. 
It might be just a streaming dongle with a headset and pad.

It might be something that somehow does some local processing giving you another price point on what the quality might be like. 
Who knows!

You're arguing about a piece of hardware we know nothing about and using that as some sort of reason for why streaming won't work as a whole. 
It'll work to varying degrees depending on connection. 
Will it have plenty of hiccups initially. 
Yes. 
Will it get better? 
Yes. 
Are we going to beat the speed of light? 
No. Will some people not give a fuck? 
Yes.

Constant path? 
Pitch? 
Airspeed? 
True Airspeed? 
Basically, for a high performance airplane, you can plot, on a series of complex curves, the specific excess energy that exists at each altitude and airspeed. 
When I say excess energy, that means the amount of energy added by thrust that exceeds the amount needed to maintain that altitude and airspeed. 
So, excess energy can be added to the airplane in the form of airspeed (kinetic energy in physics) or altitude (potential energy in physics). 
Now, as an airplane changes airspeed, the drag changes. 
So, at very low airspeed, you have a tremendous amount of induced drag - that is, drag that is created by airflow over the wings as it generates lift. 
At high airspeed, you have much lower induced drag (which varies with angle of attack) but much higher parasitic drag - that is, drag created by the resistance of air moving over the airframe. 
If you calculate both induced and parasite drag, and add them up, you end up with a drag curve. 
Very high at low speed, and very high at high speed, but there is a place in the drag curve where it is minimum, this spot is known as L/D max - where you get the greatest lift over drag ratio. 
An important spot. 
That's the speed at which you have the lowest drag and best L/D...so, that's the speed at which you have your best endurance (fuel used over time), your best glide range, and your best climb angle. 
The drag curve takes into account wing characteristics and airframe characteristics and it's true for every airplane. 
In little airplanes, like a Cessna, it's simple and absolute. 
But that curve has not taken into account the change in thrust with respect to airspeed. 
For high-performance airplanes, like an F-15, or F-14, there can be a big change in thrust with respect to airspeed. 
For example, and I think that I discussed this earlier in the thread, the F-14B, with the GE F110-400 engines, had 23,800# of thrust per engine under static (zero airspeed, sea level) conditions, but when the airplane was going 450 KIAS at sea level, that thrust increased to 32,000# per engine. 
Big difference. 
So, the derivation of specific excess energy (or power, or thrust, it's all the same) has to take into account the drag, both induced and parasite, and the changes in thrust. 
We're going to call it PS (it's actually P sub S but I can't type that on the forum). 
When all that is done, you get a measurement of specific excess power. 
Again, for example, if you got super slow in an F-14, you could have so much induced drag that the excess energy was negative. 
I've flown the airplane there, and the only way out is to reduce the AOA so that the induced drag is reduced and the engine power can start adding airspeed. 
At a higher airspeed, drag is reduced and now the airplane will be at zero excess, or perhaps positive excess. 
When you're trying to get to a new altitude, and you want to get there as quickly as possible, you want to climb at the airspeed that gives you the greatest PS. 
That speed changes as the variables change. 
An engineer named Rutowski figured this out in the 1950s and developed the climb profile that allowed the Navy's new airplane, the F-4, to set all kinds of time to climb records. 
What he did was link the max PS points and climb the airplane at those points. 
So, for an F-14, you would climb at 0.9 IMN in full AB until you hit 35,000 feet, then you would unload (fly at zero G, which gets rid of induced drag), accelerate and descend, and resume climbing at 1.2 IMN. 
At 32,000 feet or so, the PS at 1.2 IMN was GREATER than the PS when subsonic, even though the drag was higher, the thrust was higher still. 
Drag on a supersonic airplane is a complex curve... 
As you gained altitude, you would allow the speed to increase to 1.4 IMN, and continue climbing. 
What you were doing was keeping the airplane at the precise speed (airspeed down low, mach up high) that would give you best PS....that speed changes, and you have to fly the airplane in a counter-intuitive way to keep it at best PS. 
Now let's talk about setting records... At some point in the climb, you're willing to trade airspeed (kinetic) for altitude (potential)...right? 
You're trying to get to that altitude as fast as possible. 
Doesn't matter if you get there with zero speed, you got there and at that instant, the clock stops. 
So, you climb on the Rutowski profile, and then at some point, you sell all your airspeed in a zoom to the target altitude. 
You exchange kinetic for potential. 
IF you had stayed on the Rutowski profile, you would get there, but it would take you longer, as you would still be going the best climb airspeed. 
So, each target altitude in the time to climb effort required a different profile, a combination of Rutowski/best PS profile and a trade-off at the end. 
By the way, we used to do a demo in the F-14B for those who hadn't seen the climb ability of the airplane. 
From 250 KIAS at sea level, start the clock, select full AB. At 450 KIAS pull up to a 70 degree pitch. 
At 200 KIAS, roll over to level flight. 
You would be at 40,000+ feet less than 60 seconds later. 
The airplane would stay pretty close to the Rutowski profile until 35,000 feet, when instead of descending and accelerating to 1.2 IMN, you were just zooming to get to 40,000 feet. 
It was an awesome ride up, by the way. 
Not a stunt plane, like the Streak Eagle, and not an extraordinary day, like the days on which records were set, just a demo of the airplane's performance... 
A demo of its ability to generate truly awesome PS numbers...","unknown","","22","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.bobistheoilguy.com/forums/ubbthreads.php/topics/5028839/f-14-questions-answered-ask-away#7","0","0","","","0","238673512101","","false","","","","","","","0","","437000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-02T19:19:43.358+0000","","0.0","254"

"1999726385","Playstation Now","2019-03-01 23:06:29.0","Altman Vilandrie & Company Survey: 70% of U.S. Adults Now Play Games on Smartphones as Gaming Reaches Mobile Tipping Point in 2019","https://www.timesunion.com/business/press-releases/article/Altman-Vilandrie-Company-Survey-70-of-U-S-13655182.php","www.timesunion.com","neutral","news","en","us","n-a","North America","United States","","","","","2019-03-01T23:13:08.068+0000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","0","2","8602","0","","false","","","","0.0","","","0","0","","0","","0","0","","The report, which includes a comprehensive consumer survey of gaming habits in the U.S., China, Japan, and U.K., comes as mobile gaming is poised to become the dominant driver in the global gaming market in 2019, generating more revenue than Console and PC platforms combined and expanding gaming accessibility. Gaming reaches mobile tipping point The overall video game market size, projected at $167 billion for 2019, is expected to grow 5% annually from 2018 to 2022, almost entirely driven by the continued growth in mobile gaming (10% annually). Mobile is the most-used platform in gaming, with 83% of all gamers stating that they play on their smartphone or tablet, versus 54% each for Console and PC. The continued growth in popularity of Mobile has shifted the balance of power among gaming platforms; Consoles and PCs, once dominant in the gaming market, have shown only modest growth recently and will be eclipsed by Mobile revenues in 2019 ($80B Console & PC v. $86B Mobile). Despite Nintendo‚Äôs resurgence with the Switch, console shipments still lag historical highs and the overall installed base for consoles is shrinking. However, even as the market has shifted to Mobile, less than 5% of Console and PC gamers are using mobile as a replacement for even a portion of their gaming. ‚ÄúMobile is growing, but not at the expense of Console or PC,‚Äù said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Laurence Wong, co-director of the survey. ‚ÄúMobile is working to grow usage, the gamer base, and overall market.‚Äù Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality hasn‚Äôt fully arrived as a gaming platform, with only 44% of gamers (36% excluding China) having played AR/VR games. However, 67% stated (56% excluding China) that they would play games on an AR/VR device in the future. The main impediments to adoption are the still-high prices of AR/VR devices and the early state of the technology. Mobile and F2P expand gaming accessibility, player base Games that are Free-to-Play (F2P), or requiring no upfront charge, are now very popular, and were cited by players as the most common reason to try a new game. The F2P model continues to gain revenue market share with an estimated 80% of digital revenue for 2018 (Source: SuperData, January 2019). While F2P drives players to try games, the survey found that new content (e.g., new characters, new maps, DLC) is the most cited reason for continued engagement with a game. ‚ÄúThe free-to-play model gets people in the door,‚Äù said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Jon Wakelin, co-director of the survey. ‚ÄúBut without a compelling game or new content, the players are likely to move on quickly.‚Äù Altman Vilandrie & Company also discovered that Mobile has virtually closed the gaming gender gap. Women now play games at similar rates to men (79% for women v. 83% for men), buoyed by a strong preference for Mobile (33% of women gamers are ‚Äúmobile-only‚Äù compared to 15% for men). At the same time, mobile preferences vary significantly by geography and gender, with women from most countries having different preferences than men of the same nationality. By contrast, Chinese gamers of both genders shared similar preferences. ‚ÄúAn optimized Mobile portfolio needs different IP and content for nearly every major market and gender,‚Äù Wakelin said.

Gaming reaches mobile tipping point The overall video game market size, projected at $167 billion for 2019, is expected to grow 5% annually from 2018 to 2022, almost entirely driven by the continued growth in mobile gaming (10% annually). Mobile is the most-used platform in gaming, with 83% of all gamers stating that they play on their smartphone or tablet, versus 54% each for Console and PC. The continued growth in popularity of Mobile has shifted the balance of power among gaming platforms; Consoles and PCs, once dominant in the gaming market, have shown only modest growth recently and will be eclipsed by Mobile revenues in 2019 ($80B Console & PC v. $86B Mobile). Despite Nintendo‚Äôs resurgence with the Switch, console shipments still lag historical highs and the overall installed base for consoles is shrinking. However, even as the market has shifted to Mobile, less than 5% of Console and PC gamers are using mobile as a replacement for even a portion of their gaming. ‚ÄúMobile is growing, but not at the expense of Console or PC,‚Äù said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Laurence Wong, co-director of the survey. ‚ÄúMobile is working to grow usage, the gamer base, and overall market.‚Äù Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality hasn‚Äôt fully arrived as a gaming platform, with only 44% of gamers (36% excluding China) having played AR/VR games. However, 67% stated (56% excluding China) that they would play games on an AR/VR device in the future. The main impediments to adoption are the still-high prices of AR/VR devices and the early state of the technology. Mobile and F2P expand gaming accessibility, player base Games that are Free-to-Play (F2P), or requiring no upfront charge, are now very popular, and were cited by players as the most common reason to try a new game. The F2P model continues to gain revenue market share with an estimated 80% of digital revenue for 2018 (Source: SuperData, January 2019). While F2P drives players to try games, the survey found that new content (e.g., new characters, new maps, DLC) is the most cited reason for continued engagement with a game. ‚ÄúThe free-to-play model gets people in the door,‚Äù said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Jon Wakelin, co-director of the survey. ‚ÄúBut without a compelling game or new content, the players are likely to move on quickly.‚Äù Altman Vilandrie & Company also discovered that Mobile has virtually closed the gaming gender gap. Women now play games at similar rates to men (79% for women v. 83% for men), buoyed by a strong preference for Mobile (33% of women gamers are ‚Äúmobile-only‚Äù compared to 15% for men). At the same time, mobile preferences vary significantly by geography and gender, with women from most countries having different preferences than men of the same nationality. By contrast, Chinese gamers of both genders shared similar preferences. ‚ÄúAn optimized Mobile portfolio needs different IP and content for nearly every major market and gender,‚Äù Wakelin said. And, while F2P is the primary driver of adoption, players have expressed a strong willingness to pay for good games: 77% of mobile gamers say they have paid or would pay for a mobile game. Rise of new content and revenue models Players are increasingly embracing game-related video content and subscription services, introducing added opportunities for user adoption, retention, engagement, and monetization: 67% of video game players watch game-related content (e.g., eSports, Twitch); 81% of players that watch game-related content say that doing so makes them more likely to play that game; similarly, gamers that watch eSports play 2.1 hours more of the game that they watch each week; 62% of gamers pay for a game-related subscription service (e.g., PlayStation Now; Twitch Prime); 89% of gamers make in-game purchases (e.g. cosmetic, performance, or content-related upgrades). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre no longer in a world where you buy a $50 game and play it to completion and move on,‚Äù said Wakelin. ‚ÄúPlayers are consuming all types of content that is ancillary to the game itself, and they‚Äôre showing a preference for new revenue models like subscriptions and in-game transactions.‚Äù Gamers increasingly playing online and ‚Äúon-the-go‚Äù Today‚Äôs gamers are leaving the living room both physically and virtually: 60% of Mobile gamers play ‚Äúon-the-go‚Äù while commuting or traveling; at the same time, gamers are increasingly playing, watching, and buying games online. ‚ÄúThis shift in where people are playing and where the game is hosted is reducing the importance of ‚Äòwinning the living room‚Äô for publishers and console manufacturers,‚Äù said Wakelin. ‚ÄúAnd it opens the door for new providers to enter the game-service delivery chain.‚Äù Supporting this notion, 72% of gamers stated that they would be willing to play games provided by a non-traditional provider (e.g., cable company, Google).

I‚Äôm doing this for you and just for you. If I just one person‚Äôs day better today, then shit I will feel I succeeded. Today by the end of the day you will sleep knowing there‚Äôs going to be someone there for you no matter what if you send me a message even if it‚Äôs a single ‚Äúhi‚Äù. I‚Äôm just looking for people who need someone but I‚Äôm not looking for people to hookup with not a long distance romantic thing. Here‚Äôs a little about me so you know what kind of dude you‚Äôre gonna be dealing with and know who‚Äôs going to be showering you with attention and affection. I‚Äôm an Italian (born and raised in San Diego tho) and im 25 years old. I work as an elementary school teacher‚Äôs assistant but still in school to become a full time elementary school teacher. I‚Äôm not that much of a gamer but I know my stuff. I play* on the PS4 and play some games from the PS3 through PS Now so we can still play games from that too. I'm also heavily into psychological thrillers and stuff that is so depressing that it will make you wonder why there are books like that, but I‚Äôd read any type of book as well. I watch a large amount of movies too. Horror movies, biopics, and other types as well, so if you wanna write me an article about why A Serbian Film should of won Oscars, I‚Äôll be waiting for that. I love music. The music I listen to is limitless. One day I‚Äôll be listening to Johnny Cash and the next day I‚Äôll be listening to The Beatles or Ben Howard. But if you love music as well, please introduce me to your favorite songs. My sense of humor goes from dad jokes to dark sense of humor. But I can adapt to the types of jokes you like. I‚Äôm someone who likes being there for people. Giving people attention and supporting people too. I‚Äôm really patient with people. I‚Äôm also someone who doesn‚Äôt judge. Especially if you‚Äôre bad at conversations, shy or have depression/anxiety. In general, I don't care about what you look like, age, race, gender, social skills. I'm gonna be there for you. If you want to talk somewhere else just hit me up with your username and the app you want or even number. *Play as in just turn on the PS4 and play music through Spotify on blast.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/SoCalR4R/comments/awax8h/25_m4r_sandiego_im_the_most_laid_person_youll/#58e3b9160.awax8h","0","0","","","0","238494133891","","false","","","","","","post","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-01T23:02:54.530+0000","","0.0","4971"

I've been using it for 10 hours and for now this service has no cons, except one. I'm running Windows 7 and I connect my dualshock 4 to PC via bluetooth without using any 3rd party apps (except cases when I need emulate X360 controller). Most of games detect that I'm using DS4 and it's working fine, but not ps now. If I use bluetooth connection, as I always do, PS Now app just doesn't see any controller connected. It only does when I plug in a cable. Is there any way to use Dualshock 4 without a cable?","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationNow/comments/aw9cw6/using_dualshok_4_without_a_cable_pc/#595d69bd0.aw9cw6","0","0","","","0","238473624866","","false","","","","","","post","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-01T20:32:58.339+0000","","0.0","4971"

To start off, let me say that I wish nothing but the absolute best for Reggie Fils-Aime. Sure I‚Äôve had my issues with him and some of the decisions that he made, just like I did with the late great Satoru Iwata, but we know how much he loved what he did over at Nintendo. We can go back to his ‚Äúkicking ass, taking names, and making games‚Äù intro, his days as ‚Äúthe Regginator,‚Äù and his meme worthy lines such as ‚Äúmy body is ready.‚Äù Needless to say, Reggie is a huge icon when it comes to Nintendo, and when he retires in April, a huge void will be left behind. But hopefully that void will not last long, because he‚Äôs already announced his successor, Doug Bowser, a name that cannot be any more ironic. After all, who better to replace the Regginator that Mario‚Äôs own arch nemesis? Still, I‚Äôm sure he will carry on the tradition. But that is not all we‚Äôve been hearing regarding Nintendo lately. In fact, the news is more Xbox related but it still affects Nintendo. Over the last week a rumor has been circling, stating that Xbox will be expanding their Game Pass subscription service over to the Nintendo Switch. Granted this is all just a rumor, but you know how the internet acts: they are responding to it like it as fact and speculation is huge on the rise. I‚Äôm going to get the most obvious rumor out of the way, and sadly one that the mainstream press and the most extreme fanboys out there would want to happen: that this signals the end of Xbox as a hardware platform, similar to what Sega did back in 2001. This is obviously not the case because there are also reports that Microsoft is working on two more Xbox models: one codenamed ‚ÄúLockhart‚Äù which appears to be a diskless successor to the Xbox One S, and codename ‚ÄúAnaconda,‚Äù a 12-teraflop ‚Äúsuper monster‚Äù that would surpass even the Xbox One X. However, some of the specs I read are a little on the extreme side. Aside from the 12 teraflops that Anaconda will over (double that of the X,) both are including a 1TB NVME SSD hard drive. That drive alone would increase the price of both consoles significantly. A 2TB mechanical hard drive for each system would make a lot more sense. Granted these are still ways ahead in the future, and will probably be hinted at come E3, but regardless, it proves Microsoft will still be producing Xbox consoles in the future. It will also be quite interesting to see what titles would come to Game Pass. After all, even the standard Xbox One and the Xbox One S are more powerful than the Nintendo Switch, more so when in a portable state. That‚Äôs not even including the limited storage space the Switch has, even with a memory card installed. Will there be a cut down version designed to take advantage of the Switch‚Äôs hardware? Will games be streamed in the same way they are with Sony‚Äôs PlayStation Now? After all, some Switch games in Japan are played via streaming. Lastly, will this also allow Microsoft to help Nintendo out with their fledgling Nintendo Online service? I have to admit, this partnership does not surprise me at all. Nintendo and Microsoft have been helping each other out the past two years. Microsoft allowed crossplay on Minecraft to work with those who play on PC and Switch along with Xbox, and just last year when Sony refused crossplay on Fortnite, players on both Nintendo and Microsoft were welcome to play with each other. So this is just one more step in their beliefs that gaming should not be limited based on platform. Now I know what you‚Äôre saying. ‚ÄúI thought you hated this idea? Didn‚Äôt you go off on Sega when they went multiplatform?‚Äù Yes, I did, and I still stand by my comments from back in 2001. But as I said earlier this is because Sega completely turned their back on Dreamcast owners, even going as far as canceling Shenmue II just one week before it was going to come out. Microsoft is not killing off Xbox consoles, and this feels like an expansion of their ‚ÄúPlay Anywhere‚Äù service that I‚Äôve enjoyed on my laptop. It‚Äôs just another way for me to take my games on the go. I can still play them on my Xbox at home, and then on the road just take my laptop or my Switch with me with progression going along on all three platforms, something I wish I could do with Metro Exodus, which has me playing a separate save on my Steam account compared to my X. But still, I do hope that if this all comes true, Nintendo brings some of their source material over to the Xbox platform too. Currently Playing: Anthem (Xbox One X,) Metro Exodus (Xbox One X/PC on Steam) Waiting For: Devil May Cry 5","unknown","","51","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.gameindustry.com/editorials/hardcore/strange-and-wonderful-days-ahead-for-nintendo/","0","0","","","0","238461249663","","false","","","","","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-01T19:06:57.613+0000","","5.14","0"

Mobile continues to increase accessibility and broaden the gamer base, largely closing the gender gap in gaming (83% of men play games v. 79% of women). Also, 77% of gamers are willing to pay for games and 89% make in-game purchases, while Free-to-Play games gain popularity. PR Newswire BOSTON, March 1, 2019 BOSTON, March 1, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ ‚Äì After years of surging mobile gaming growth, 70% of American adults now play video games on their smartphones, according to a new report on gaming trends released today by strategy consulting firm Altman Vilandrie & Company. The report, which includes a comprehensive consumer survey of gaming habits in the U.S., China, Japan, and U.K., comes as mobile gaming is poised to become the dominant driver in the global gaming market in 2019, generating more revenue than Console and PC platforms combined and expanding gaming accessibility. Gaming reaches mobile tipping point The overall video game market size, projected at $167 billion for 2019, is expected to grow 5% annually from 2018 to 2022, almost entirely driven by the continued growth in mobile gaming (10% annually). Mobile is the most-used platform in gaming, with 83% of all gamers stating that they play on their smartphone or tablet, versus 54% each for Console and PC. The continued growth in popularity of Mobile has shifted the balance of power among gaming platforms; Consoles and PCs, once dominant in the gaming market, have shown only modest growth recently and will be eclipsed by Mobile revenues in 2019 ( $80B Console & PC v. $86B Mobile). Despite Nintendo‚Äôs resurgence with the Switch, console shipments still lag historical highs and the overall installed base for consoles is shrinking. However, even as the market has shifted to Mobile, less than 5% of Console and PC gamers are using mobile as a replacement for even a portion of their gaming. ‚ÄúMobile is growing, but not at the expense of Console or PC,‚Äù said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Laurence Wong, co-director of the survey. ‚ÄúMobile is working to grow usage, the gamer base, and overall market.‚Äù Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality hasn‚Äôt fully arrived as a gaming platform, with only 44% of gamers (36% excluding China ) having played AR/VR games. However, 67% stated (56% excluding China ) that they would play games on an AR/VR device in the future. The main impediments to adoption are the still-high prices of AR/VR devices and the early state of the technology. Mobile and F2P expand gaming accessibility, player base Games that are Free-to-Play (F2P), or requiring no upfront charge, are now very popular, and were cited by players as the most common reason to try a new game. The F2P model continues to gain revenue market share with an estimated 80% of digital revenue for 2018 (Source: SuperData, January 2019 ). While F2P drives players to try games, the survey found that new content (e.g., new characters, new maps, DLC) is the most cited reason for continued engagement with a game. ‚ÄúThe free-to-play model gets people in the door,‚Äù said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Jon Wakelin, co-director of the survey. ‚ÄúBut without a compelling game or new content, the players are likely to move on quickly.‚Äù Altman Vilandrie & Company also discovered that Mobile has virtually closed the gaming gender gap. Women now play games at similar rates to men (79% for women v. 83% for men), buoyed by a strong preference for Mobile (33% of women gamers are ‚Äúmobile-only‚Äù compared to 15% for men). At the same time, mobile preferences vary significantly by geography and gender, with women from most countries having different preferences than men of the same nationality. By contrast, Chinese gamers of both genders shared similar preferences. ‚ÄúAn optimized Mobile portfolio needs different IP and content for nearly every major market and gender,‚Äù Wakelin said. And, while F2P is the primary driver of adoption, players have expressed a strong willingness to pay for good games: 77% of mobile gamers say they have paid or would pay for a mobile game. Rise of new content and revenue models Players are increasingly embracing game-related video content and subscription services, introducing added opportunities for user adoption, retention, engagement, and monetization: 67% of video game players watch game-related content (e.g., eSports, Twitch); 81% of players that watch game-related content say that doing so makes them more likely to play that game; similarly, gamers that watch eSports play 2.1 hours more of the game that they watch each week; 62% of gamers pay for a game-related subscription service (e.g., PlayStation Now; Twitch Prime); 89% of gamers make in-game purchases (e.g. cosmetic, performance, or content-related upgrades). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre no longer in a world where you buy a $50 game and play it to completion and move on,‚Äù said Wakelin. ‚ÄúPlayers are consuming all types of content that is ancillary to the game itself, and they‚Äôre showing a preference for new revenue models like subscriptions and in-game transactions.‚Äù Gamers increasingly playing online and ‚Äúon-the-go‚Äù Today‚Äôs gamers are leaving the living room both physically and virtually: 60% of Mobile gamers play ‚Äúon-the-go‚Äù while commuting or traveling; at the same time, gamers are increasingly playing, watching, and buying games online. ‚ÄúThis shift in where people are playing and where the game is hosted is reducing the importance of ‚Äòwinning the living room‚Äô for publishers and console manufacturers,‚Äù said Wakelin. ‚ÄúAnd it opens the door for new providers to enter the game-service delivery chain.‚Äù Supporting this notion, 72% of gamers stated that they would be willing to play games provided by a non-traditional provider (e.g., cable company, Google). This shift has been enabled by improvements to internet infrastructure, from stronger mobile networks to faster wireline bandwidth to better cloud-based delivery models; however, there hasn‚Äôt been a significant amount of direct monetization from the telecom players. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt yet seen the cloud and internet service providers take advantage of this new source of demand, but it should happen soon,‚Äù said Wong. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already seen instances of Comcast, Google, and Sprint entering the gaming space in various ways, and more will follow.‚Äù Altman Vilandrie & Company fielded the online survey in January 2019 to more than 2,200 respondents (from U.S., U.K., China, and Japan ) provided by Dynata. Additional key portions of the analysis as well as charts and sources to support the findings are available here. More survey results, including detailed country-breakdowns and on eSports, will be released this spring. For more details on the survey please contact gamingsurvey(at)altvil(dot)com.

""The free-to-play model gets people in the door,"" said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Jon Wakelin, co-director of the survey. ""But without a compelling game or new content, the players are likely to move on quickly."" Altman Vilandrie & Company also discovered that Mobile has virtually closed the gaming gender gap. Women now play games at similar rates to men (79% for women v. 83% for men), buoyed by a strong preference for Mobile (33% of women gamers are ""mobile-only"" compared to 15% for men). At the same time, mobile preferences vary significantly by geography and gender, with women from most countries having different preferences than men of the same nationality. By contrast, Chinese gamers of both genders shared similar preferences. ""An optimized Mobile portfolio needs different IP and content for nearly every major market and gender,"" Wakelin said. And, while F2P is the primary driver of adoption, players have expressed a strong willingness to pay for good games: 77% of mobile gamers say they have paid or would pay for a mobile game.

The report, which includes a comprehensive consumer survey of gaming habits in the U.S., China, Japan, and U.K., comes as mobile gaming is poised to become the dominant driver in the global gaming market in 2019, generating more revenue than Console and PC platforms combined and expanding gaming accessibility. Gaming reaches mobile tipping point The overall video game market size, projected at $167 billion for 2019, is expected to grow 5% annually from 2018 to 2022, almost entirely driven by the continued growth in mobile gaming (10% annually). Mobile is the most-used platform in gaming, with 83% of all gamers stating that they play on their smartphone or tablet, versus 54% each for Console and PC. The continued growth in popularity of Mobile has shifted the balance of power among gaming platforms; Consoles and PCs, once dominant in the gaming market, have shown only modest growth recently and will be eclipsed by Mobile revenues in 2019 ( $80B Console & PC v. $86B Mobile). Despite Nintendo's resurgence with the Switch, console shipments still lag historical highs and the overall installed base for consoles is shrinking. However, even as the market has shifted to Mobile, less than 5% of Console and PC gamers are using mobile as a replacement for even a portion of their gaming. ""Mobile is growing, but not at the expense of Console or PC,"" said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Laurence Wong, co-director of the survey. ""Mobile is working to grow usage, the gamer base, and overall market.""

Gaming reaches mobile tipping point The overall video game market size, projected at $167 billion for 2019, is expected to grow 5% annually from 2018 to 2022, almost entirely driven by the continued growth in mobile gaming (10% annually). Mobile is the most-used platform in gaming, with 83% of all gamers stating that they play on their smartphone or tablet, versus 54% each for Console and PC. The continued growth in popularity of Mobile has shifted the balance of power among gaming platforms; Consoles and PCs, once dominant in the gaming market, have shown only modest growth recently and will be eclipsed by Mobile revenues in 2019 ( $80B Console & PC v. $86B Mobile). Despite Nintendo's resurgence with the Switch, console shipments still lag historical highs and the overall installed base for consoles is shrinking. However, even as the market has shifted to Mobile, less than 5% of Console and PC gamers are using mobile as a replacement for even a portion of their gaming. ""Mobile is growing, but not at the expense of Console or PC,"" said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Laurence Wong, co-director of the survey. ""Mobile is working to grow usage, the gamer base, and overall market."" Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality hasn't fully arrived as a gaming platform, with only 44% of gamers (36% excluding China ) having played AR/VR games. However, 67% stated (56% excluding China ) that they would play games on an AR/VR device in the future. The main impediments to adoption are the still-high prices of AR/VR devices and the early state of the technology. Mobile and F2P expand gaming accessibility, player base Games that are Free-to-Play (F2P), or requiring no upfront charge, are now very popular, and were cited by players as the most common reason to try a new game. The F2P model continues to gain revenue market share with an estimated 80% of digital revenue for 2018 (Source: SuperData, January 2019 ). While F2P drives players to try games, the survey found that new content (e.g., new characters, new maps, DLC) is the most cited reason for continued engagement with a game. ""The free-to-play model gets people in the door,"" said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Jon Wakelin, co-director of the survey. ""But without a compelling game or new content, the players are likely to move on quickly."" Altman Vilandrie & Company also discovered that Mobile has virtually closed the gaming gender gap. Women now play games at similar rates to men (79% for women v. 83% for men), buoyed by a strong preference for Mobile (33% of women gamers are ""mobile-only"" compared to 15% for men). At the same time, mobile preferences vary significantly by geography and gender, with women from most countries having different preferences than men of the same nationality. By contrast, Chinese gamers of both genders shared similar preferences. ""An optimized Mobile portfolio needs different IP and content for nearly every major market and gender,"" Wakelin said. And, while F2P is the primary driver of adoption, players have expressed a strong willingness to pay for good games: 77% of mobile gamers say they have paid or would pay for a mobile game. Rise of new content and revenue models Players are increasingly embracing game-related video content and subscription services, introducing added opportunities for user adoption, retention, engagement, and monetization: 67% of video game players watch game-related content (e.g., eSports, Twitch); 81% of players that watch game-related content say that doing so makes them more likely to play that game; similarly, gamers that watch eSports play 2.1 hours more of the game that they watch each week; 62% of gamers pay for a game-related subscription service (e.g., PlayStation Now; Twitch Prime); 89% of gamers make in-game purchases (e.g. cosmetic, performance, or content-related upgrades). ""We're no longer in a world where you buy a $50 game and play it to completion and move on,"" said Wakelin. ""Players are consuming all types of content that is ancillary to the game itself, and they're showing a preference for new revenue models like subscriptions and in-game transactions."" Gamers increasingly playing online and ""on-the-go"" Today's gamers are leaving the living room both physically and virtually: 60% of Mobile gamers play ""on-the-go"" while commuting or traveling; at the same time, gamers are increasingly playing, watching, and buying games online. ""This shift in where people are playing and where the game is hosted is reducing the importance of 'winning the living room' for publishers and console manufacturers,"" said Wakelin. ""And it opens the door for new providers to enter the game-service delivery chain."" Supporting this notion, 72% of gamers stated that they would be willing to play games provided by a non-traditional provider (e.g., cable company, Google). This shift has been enabled by improvements to internet infrastructure, from stronger mobile networks to faster wireline bandwidth to better cloud-based delivery models; however, there hasn't been a significant amount of direct monetization from the telecom players. ""We haven't yet seen the cloud and internet service providers take advantage of this new source of demand, but it should happen soon,"" said Wong. ""We've already seen instances of Comcast, Google, and Sprint entering the gaming space in various ways, and more will follow."" Altman Vilandrie & Company fielded the online survey in January 2019 to more than 2,200 respondents (from U.S., U.K., China, and Japan ) provided by Dynata. Additional key portions of the analysis as well as charts and sources to support the findings are available here.

The continued growth in popularity of Mobile has shifted the balance of power among gaming platforms; Consoles and PCs, once dominant in the gaming market, have shown only modest growth recently and will be eclipsed by Mobile revenues in 2019 ( $80B Console & PC v. $86B Mobile). Despite Nintendo's resurgence with the Switch, console shipments still lag historical highs and the overall installed base for consoles is shrinking. However, even as the market has shifted to Mobile, less than 5% of Console and PC gamers are using mobile as a replacement for even a portion of their gaming. ""Mobile is growing, but not at the expense of Console or PC,"" said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Laurence Wong, co-director of the survey. ""Mobile is working to grow usage, the gamer base, and overall market."" Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality hasn't fully arrived as a gaming platform, with only 44% of gamers (36% excluding China ) having played AR/VR games. However, 67% stated (56% excluding China ) that they would play games on an AR/VR device in the future. The main impediments to adoption are the still-high prices of AR/VR devices and the early state of the technology. Mobile and F2P expand gaming accessibility, player base Games that are Free-to-Play (F2P), or requiring no upfront charge, are now very popular, and were cited by players as the most common reason to try a new game. The F2P model continues to gain revenue market share with an estimated 80% of digital revenue for 2018 (Source: SuperData, January 2019 ). While F2P drives players to try games, the survey found that new content (e.g., new characters, new maps, DLC) is the most cited reason for continued engagement with a game. ""The free-to-play model gets people in the door,"" said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Jon Wakelin, co-director of the survey. ""But without a compelling game or new content, the players are likely to move on quickly."" Altman Vilandrie & Company also discovered that Mobile has virtually closed the gaming gender gap. Women now play games at similar rates to men (79% for women v. 83% for men), buoyed by a strong preference for Mobile (33% of women gamers are ""mobile-only"" compared to 15% for men). At the same time, mobile preferences vary significantly by geography and gender, with women from most countries having different preferences than men of the same nationality. By contrast, Chinese gamers of both genders shared similar preferences. ""An optimized Mobile portfolio needs different IP and content for nearly every major market and gender,"" Wakelin said. And, while F2P is the primary driver of adoption, players have expressed a strong willingness to pay for good games: 77% of mobile gamers say they have paid or would pay for a mobile game. Rise of new content and revenue models Players are increasingly embracing game-related video content and subscription services, introducing added opportunities for user adoption, retention, engagement, and monetization: 67% of video game players watch game-related content (e.g., eSports, Twitch); 81% of players that watch game-related content say that doing so makes them more likely to play that game; similarly, gamers that watch eSports play 2.1 hours more of the game that they watch each week; 62% of gamers pay for a game-related subscription service (e.g., PlayStation Now; Twitch Prime); 89% of gamers make in-game purchases (e.g. cosmetic, performance, or content-related upgrades). ""We're no longer in a world where you buy a $50 game and play it to completion and move on,"" said Wakelin. ""Players are consuming all types of content that is ancillary to the game itself, and they're showing a preference for new revenue models like subscriptions and in-game transactions."" Gamers increasingly playing online and ""on-the-go"" Today's gamers are leaving the living room both physically and virtually: 60% of Mobile gamers play ""on-the-go"" while commuting or traveling; at the same time, gamers are increasingly playing, watching, and buying games online. ""This shift in where people are playing and where the game is hosted is reducing the importance of 'winning the living room' for publishers and console manufacturers,"" said Wakelin. ""And it opens the door for new providers to enter the game-service delivery chain."" Supporting this notion, 72% of gamers stated that they would be willing to play games provided by a non-traditional provider (e.g., cable company, Google). This shift has been enabled by improvements to internet infrastructure, from stronger mobile networks to faster wireline bandwidth to better cloud-based delivery models; however, there hasn't been a significant amount of direct monetization from the telecom players. ""We haven't yet seen the cloud and internet service providers take advantage of this new source of demand, but it should happen soon,"" said Wong. ""We've already seen instances of Comcast, Google, and Sprint entering the gaming space in various ways, and more will follow."" Altman Vilandrie & Company fielded the online survey in January 2019 to more than 2,200 respondents (from U.S., U.K., China, and Japan ) provided by Dynata.

My search through Google leads most of the time to some answers regarding FS2004 and the AFCAD editor which is replaced with ADE for FSX... ups sorry - I've FSX installed with Acceleration and that stuff.

In this forum I searched the first 17 pages, found some - I would say - questions that were in some points similar to mine, but the solutions there didn't work on my problem.

What do I want you ask?

OK let's go:

A week ago I made a flight from EDDF to LTBA (Istanbul airport in turkey). 
Everything went perfect except 10 miles before the approach. 
I recognized that the LOC and GS stayed 'armed' and nothing more (I fly 737NGX).

Everytime I entered the ILS course of 174 in the MCP and pressed the approach button the ILS course on the MCP was reset to 177, nothing I could do... 
I read my approach chart again and again and the ILS course and frequency was 111.1/174¬∞.

Then after some tests and reading in forums I came across ADE and took a look at the airport and guess what: runway 17L doesn't exist, only 18L and 18R... 
The ILS course of them were 181,3 with a MagVar of -3,3 (which is the ILS course the MCP automatically put in all the time).

Now I wanted to do the following:

Alter the magnetic course of the airport: I entered -7,3 in the properties for MagVar on the airport to match get the 174¬∞

Alter runway identifiers: changed 18L to 17L

Created a new ILS approach and entered everything from the stock ILS and then removed it.

After that was done:

I compiled the 'new' airport and put it in the folder \addon scenery\corrections\scenery\cor_ltba.bgl

After that I started FSX and added this folder to my library and put it on top of all.

Now I was curious as hell if my efforts were enough and loaded my flight again. 
Everything seems perfect but as I entered 174¬∞ in the MCP for the ILS course and then clicked on ""App"" the same thing happened again, the course was reset to 177¬∞, no change at all.

So my question to the community is - because I thought that someone must be here who does the same - how do you alter a stock airport in FSX to match the current NavData cycle?

Some of you might ask: Why does he remove the stock ILS (as I did)? 
Because I learned with EDDF, that identifiers and frequencies can also change. 
The identifiers aren't editable when it's a stock ILS. 
So I wanted to have an editable ILS for the future in case the frequencies and identifiers of the ILS change again.

How do you edit a stock airport to correct the new heading (174¬∞ was on the chart, 177¬∞ was in FSX) and remove the stock ILS BUT keep the entire approach (because the approach didn't change, I just want to have an editable ILS)?

After compiling and reopening the airport the ILS is still declared as 'stock' though I deleted it... strange thing.

I hope that some of you can answer me - I don't want detailed explanations, because for this I have the manual ready... 
I just want to know how some of you who simply want to edit stock airports like me, fit the ones on the actual NavChart?

If you need the project file from ADE... I'll provide it when I'm back at home (in the evening), maybe I've overseen an option.

Thank you for any help here and I hope we can find a solution for my query together.

Best regards,

Frank

PS: now i was at home (text written in a break) and have attached the project file. 
Now I was curious as hell if my efforts were enough and loaded my flight again. 
Everything seems perfect but as I entered 174¬∞ in the MCP for the ILS course and then clicked on ""App"" the same thing happened again, the course was reset to 177¬∞, no change at all.

The Mag value of a airport listed as per ADE is not a useful code in FS.

Airports get the mag value from the Magdec.bgl in the world scenery folder. 
Even though each airport and each runway has a mag value, when you change it FS does not recognize the change.

The only way to make the runway/ILS mag value change in FS is to change the runway true heading.

We can only assume that MS was going to allow each airport to have a working mag value since they gave each airport a seperate mag value. 
However that was never coded.

You cannot delete a stock ILS. 
ADE should have gave you a warning. 
If you do bypass the warming and delete the ILS we orphan it which means it still exist but out of the way with no ILS freq. 
This is used to decommission a ILS that has been removed from a runway.

Thanks for clarifying some things for me. 
I thought changing the MagValue corrects the headings as well.

Regarding the ILS:

I right-klicked at the stock ILS and then delete. 
No warning at all. 
I read in the manual that the ILS is not really deleted, just orphaned.

So, is there no way to alter stock airports the way they match with current NavData?

Best regards,

Frank

Regarding the ILS:

I right-klicked at the stock ILS and then delete. 
No warning at all. 
I read in the manual that the ILS is not really deleted, just orphaned.

If you were able to select an ILS and find Delete in the Right Click Menu then the ILS was not recognized by ADE as a stock ILS.

ADE will do several things if an ILS is stock. 
First the Tooltip will be a pale purple color; second the words From Stock will appear in the tooltip; third if you right click on it after selection there will be no Delete menu option and fourth if you use the Delete key you will get the warning that Jim refers to.

So it seems possible that the airport you are working on did not start directly as a stock airport. 
Or you are loading the airport from the Bgl file you created rather than loading the ADE project file.

If this airport was opened from a Bgl file created by AFCAD or AFX then it is entirely possible that you can apparently delete a stock ILS because of the way these utilities handle them.

You may find that if you were able to delete the ILS in ADE and compile it that in fact when you open the airport in FS then the ILS will still be there in its original location.

It is beyound the scope of ADE to hack MS stock files. 
FS is a moment in time but that time has come and gone. 
There are some 3rd party updated magdec.bgl 
files on certain web sites but in most cases they can cause a CTD.

FS and ADE will update the Mag Value of the VOR but this is allowed by MS.

thanks you two for clarifying my question.

I'll then search in the Freeware libraries of Avsim for a corrected Airport file. 
Maybe there're some users around which created an entirely new LTBA Airport with the stock Airport as reference.

For the updated MagVar files I also found a resource.

Again, thank you very much and have a nice weekend.

The report, which includes a comprehensive consumer survey of gaming habits in the U.S., China, Japan, and U.K., comes as mobile gaming is poised to become the dominant driver in the global gaming market in 2019, generating more revenue than Console and PC platforms combined and expanding gaming accessibility. Gaming reaches mobile tipping point The overall video game market size, projected at $167 billion for 2019, is expected to grow 5% annually from 2018 to 2022, almost entirely driven by the continued growth in mobile gaming (10% annually). Mobile is the most-used platform in gaming, with 83% of all gamers stating that they play on their smartphone or tablet, versus 54% each for Console and PC. The continued growth in popularity of Mobile has shifted the balance of power among gaming platforms; Consoles and PCs, once dominant in the gaming market, have shown only modest growth recently and will be eclipsed by Mobile revenues in 2019 ($80B Console & PC v. $86B Mobile). Despite Nintendo‚Äôs resurgence with the Switch, console shipments still lag historical highs and the overall installed base for consoles is shrinking. However, even as the market has shifted to Mobile, less than 5% of Console and PC gamers are using mobile as a replacement for even a portion of their gaming. ‚ÄúMobile is growing, but not at the expense of Console or PC,‚Äù said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Laurence Wong, co-director of the survey. ‚ÄúMobile is working to grow usage, the gamer base, and overall market.‚Äù Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality hasn‚Äôt fully arrived as a gaming platform, with only 44% of gamers (36% excluding China) having played AR/VR games. However, 67% stated (56% excluding China) that they would play games on an AR/VR device in the future. The main impediments to adoption are the still-high prices of AR/VR devices and the early state of the technology. Mobile and F2P expand gaming accessibility, player base Games that are Free-to-Play (F2P), or requiring no upfront charge, are now very popular, and were cited by players as the most common reason to try a new game. The F2P model continues to gain revenue market share with an estimated 80% of digital revenue for 2018 (Source: SuperData, January 2019). While F2P drives players to try games, the survey found that new content (e.g., new characters, new maps, DLC) is the most cited reason for continued engagement with a game. ‚ÄúThe free-to-play model gets people in the door,‚Äù said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Jon Wakelin, co-director of the survey. ‚ÄúBut without a compelling game or new content, the players are likely to move on quickly.‚Äù Altman Vilandrie & Company also discovered that Mobile has virtually closed the gaming gender gap. Women now play games at similar rates to men (79% for women v. 83% for men), buoyed by a strong preference for Mobile (33% of women gamers are ‚Äúmobile-only‚Äù compared to 15% for men). At the same time, mobile preferences vary significantly by geography and gender, with women from most countries having different preferences than men of the same nationality. By contrast, Chinese gamers of both genders shared similar preferences. ‚ÄúAn optimized Mobile portfolio needs different IP and content for nearly every major market and gender,‚Äù Wakelin said. And, while F2P is the primary driver of adoption, players have expressed a strong willingness to pay for good games: 77% of mobile gamers say they have paid or would pay for a mobile game. Rise of new content and revenue models Players are increasingly embracing game-related video content and subscription services, introducing added opportunities for user adoption, retention, engagement, and monetization: 67% of video game players watch game-related content (e.g., eSports, Twitch); 81% of players that watch game-related content say that doing so makes them more likely to play that game; similarly, gamers that watch eSports play 2.1 hours more of the game that they watch each week; 62% of gamers pay for a game-related subscription service (e.g., PlayStation Now; Twitch Prime); 89% of gamers make in-game purchases (e.g. cosmetic, performance, or content-related upgrades). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre no longer in a world where you buy a $50 game and play it to completion and move on,‚Äù said Wakelin. ‚ÄúPlayers are consuming all types of content that is ancillary to the game itself, and they‚Äôre showing a preference for new revenue models like subscriptions and in-game transactions.‚Äù Gamers increasingly playing online and ‚Äúon-the-go‚Äù Today‚Äôs gamers are leaving the living room both physically and virtually: 60% of Mobile gamers play ‚Äúon-the-go‚Äù while commuting or traveling; at the same time, gamers are increasingly playing, watching, and buying games online. ‚ÄúThis shift in where people are playing and where the game is hosted is reducing the importance of ‚Äòwinning the living room‚Äô for publishers and console manufacturers,‚Äù said Wakelin. ‚ÄúAnd it opens the door for new providers to enter the game-service delivery chain.‚Äù Supporting this notion, 72% of gamers stated that they would be willing to play games provided by a non-traditional provider (e.g., cable company, Google). This shift has been enabled by improvements to internet infrastructure, from stronger mobile networks to faster wireline bandwidth to better cloud-based delivery models; however, there hasn‚Äôt been a significant amount of direct monetization from the telecom players. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt yet seen the cloud and internet service providers take advantage of this new source of demand, but it should happen soon,‚Äù said Wong. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already seen instances of Comcast, Google, and Sprint entering the gaming space in various ways, and more will follow.‚Äù Altman Vilandrie & Company fielded the online survey in January 2019 to more than 2,200 respondents (from U.S., U.K., China, and Japan) provided by Dynata. Additional key portions of the analysis as well as charts and sources to support the findings are available here. More survey results, including detailed country-breakdowns and on eSports, will be released this spring. For more details on the survey please contact gamingsurvey(at)altvil(dot)com.

Gaming reaches mobile tipping point The overall video game market size, projected at $167 billion for 2019, is expected to grow 5% annually from 2018 to 2022, almost entirely driven by the continued growth in mobile gaming (10% annually). Mobile is the most-used platform in gaming, with 83% of all gamers stating that they play on their smartphone or tablet, versus 54% each for Console and PC. The continued growth in popularity of Mobile has shifted the balance of power among gaming platforms; Consoles and PCs, once dominant in the gaming market, have shown only modest growth recently and will be eclipsed by Mobile revenues in 2019 ( $80B Console & PC v. $86B Mobile). Despite Nintendo's resurgence with the Switch, console shipments still lag historical highs and the overall installed base for consoles is shrinking. However, even as the market has shifted to Mobile, less than 5% of Console and PC gamers are using mobile as a replacement for even a portion of their gaming. ""Mobile is growing, but not at the expense of Console or PC,"" said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Laurence Wong, co-director of the survey. ""Mobile is working to grow usage, the gamer base, and overall market."" Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality hasn't fully arrived as a gaming platform, with only 44% of gamers (36% excluding China ) having played AR/VR games. However, 67% stated (56% excluding China ) that they would play games on an AR/VR device in the future. The main impediments to adoption are the still-high prices of AR/VR devices and the early state of the technology. Mobile and F2P expand gaming accessibility, player base Games that are Free-to-Play (F2P), or requiring no upfront charge, are now very popular, and were cited by players as the most common reason to try a new game. The F2P model continues to gain revenue market share with an estimated 80% of digital revenue for 2018 (Source: SuperData, January 2019 ). While F2P drives players to try games, the survey found that new content (e.g., new characters, new maps, DLC) is the most cited reason for continued engagement with a game. ""The free-to-play model gets people in the door,"" said Altman Vilandrie & Company Principal Jon Wakelin, co-director of the survey. ""But without a compelling game or new content, the players are likely to move on quickly."" Altman Vilandrie & Company also discovered that Mobile has virtually closed the gaming gender gap. Women now play games at similar rates to men (79% for women v. 83% for men), buoyed by a strong preference for Mobile (33% of women gamers are ""mobile-only"" compared to 15% for men). At the same time, mobile preferences vary significantly by geography and gender, with women from most countries having different preferences than men of the same nationality. By contrast, Chinese gamers of both genders shared similar preferences. ""An optimized Mobile portfolio needs different IP and content for nearly every major market and gender,"" Wakelin said. And, while F2P is the primary driver of adoption, players have expressed a strong willingness to pay for good games: 77% of mobile gamers say they have paid or would pay for a mobile game. Rise of new content and revenue models Players are increasingly embracing game-related video content and subscription services, introducing added opportunities for user adoption, retention, engagement, and monetization: 67% of video game players watch game-related content (e.g., eSports, Twitch); 81% of players that watch game-related content say that doing so makes them more likely to play that game; similarly, gamers that watch eSports play 2.1 hours more of the game that they watch each week; 62% of gamers pay for a game-related subscription service (e.g., PlayStation Now; Twitch Prime); 89% of gamers make in-game purchases (e.g. cosmetic, performance, or content-related upgrades). ""We're no longer in a world where you buy a $50 game and play it to completion and move on,"" said Wakelin. ""Players are consuming all types of content that is ancillary to the game itself, and they're showing a preference for new revenue models like subscriptions and in-game transactions."" Gamers increasingly playing online and ""on-the-go"" Today's gamers are leaving the living room both physically and virtually: 60% of Mobile gamers play ""on-the-go"" while commuting or traveling; at the same time, gamers are increasingly playing, watching, and buying games online. ""This shift in where people are playing and where the game is hosted is reducing the importance of 'winning the living room' for publishers and console manufacturers,"" said Wakelin. ""And it opens the door for new providers to enter the game-service delivery chain."" Supporting this notion, 72% of gamers stated that they would be willing to play games provided by a non-traditional provider (e.g., cable company, Google). This shift has been enabled by improvements to internet infrastructure, from stronger mobile networks to faster wireline bandwidth to better cloud-based delivery models; however, there hasn't been a significant amount of direct monetization from the telecom players.

Really hoping this is fake.

I got too many games to play on my PS3. 
I I will never be able to do them all before May 2019

I am obviously aware eventually this will happen, but would hope they would announce it way in advance (like a year or so, so we can buy/download all that we need to) and secondly not before the PS5...

Really hope you are right

In any case i will double down on doing PS3 games until May just in case. 
Just finished Killzone HD, will chain to Killzone 2. I am not worrying too much about trophies on this game as servers are shut down and even if they where not, the trophies where ridiculous anyway, was not gonna do them. 
I will just play the game regulary and enjoy it.

I don't know, maybe stuff is different in [insert region here], but if I saw ANYTHING from ANY company that starts with I would already know it's fake. 
Typical fake Apple or PayPal email bullshit that only the most amateur of conjobs use.

Source: The 5-10 emails of that nature I receive every day.

Nah, fake as hell.

That ""Atencion"" is missing an accent mark. 
""Atenci√≥n"" is the correct word. 
An announcement like that wouldn't have such stupid spelling mistakes. 
Probably someone bored modified the source code, added that line and took the photo. 
A really bad photo by the way. 
Also, these announcements are done with much anticipation.

It‚Äôs unlikely PS3 servers would shut down anytime soon because PS Now is also keeping it alive with allowing you to access PS3 games to play including the multiplayer portion if the servers are still active. 
So I don‚Äôt see PS3 going down for a few more years or at least until PS Now becomes like Xbox Games Pass where you can play certain new releases too. 
So yeah I am sure it will be fine.","unknown","","26","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://forum.psnprofiles.com/topic/71768-ps3-online-features-shutting-down-in-may-2019/","0","0","","","0","238404934615","","false","","","","","","","0","","2167000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-01T13:11:37.219+0000","","0.0","1048"

Cloud gaming? Yes, streaming the video and audio of a game from the cloud to your computer, so your computer doesn‚Äôt have to do the actual computing to produce sound and image. Play the best games on max settings with your potato hardware.The Problem With PC Gaming Here‚Äôs the problem that PC gamers face on an almost continuous basis: games ask for too much. Companies keep on pushing the boundaries of how realistic they can make a game look, which naturally requires better hardware. I‚Äôll give you Battlefield V as an example. It‚Äôs one of the first games that incorporates real-time ray-traced graphics for ultra-realistic lighting and reflections. Currently, only three graphics cards support ray tracing, and they‚Äôre all from NVIDIA: the RTX 2070, 2080, and the 2080 Ti. A single 2080 Ti will set you back $1,200. Building a fast PC with a 2080 Ti can easily cost you between $2,500 to $3,000, if not more. Of those 1.2 billion gamers, how many do you think can afford $1,200 for realistic reflections in a game? That‚Äôs right, not many. Of course, that‚Äôs not the point. Game developers and hardware manufacturers have to keep on pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs technically possible. They know it won‚Äôt be affordable for 99.9% of gamers, but things will get cheaper and the benefits of what they‚Äôre doing now will trickle down to those with a lower budget eventually. But even the minimum PC requirements to play certain games are out of reach for many gamers. Playing Far Cry 5 is computationally intensive for most okay PCs. I‚Äôm writing this from a slow Surface laptop. There‚Äôs no way I can play AAA games, even at the lowest graphical settings. And if you do have a good PC or laptop, not upgrading it at least once a year means you‚Äôll eventually won‚Äôt be able to play the newest games in good detail anymore. Playing on a PC is expensive and it requires upkeep of hundreds of dollars a year if you want to play the latest games in their full glory.Cloud Gaming is the Solution So imagine you don‚Äôt need any expensive hardware to play the latest games in full detail. That‚Äôs the premise (and promise) of cloud gaming. All you need is fast broadband to stream video and audio down to your device. Technically, you could plug an Ethernet cable into a Raspberry Pi, hook it up to a screen, and play the latest Assassin‚Äôs Creed without any problem. Your device won‚Äôt even get warm. But cloud gaming isn‚Äôt just interesting for gamers, it‚Äôs interesting for game developers too. After all, the developers who make the game want people to be able to play it on max settings. They don‚Äôt want them to play a watered-down version simply because their hardware doesn‚Äôt allow for nice water and grass. It‚Äôs motivating if you know that everyone will be able to play your game as you intend it to be played.Problems With Cloud Gaming So how come cloud gaming isn‚Äôt a thing yet? What‚Äôs stopping companies from offering gamers a cloud gaming solution? Turns out that companies have tried. And failed. It‚Äôs apparently really difficult to stream content from the cloud to other devices. OnLive was a company founded in 2003 that allowed gamers to rent computer games without installing them on their devices, streaming video and audio to gamers‚Äô devices instead. Gaikai was another U.S. company that had a platform where you could stream a game over a local wired or wireless network. OnLive went defunct in 2015 and its patents were acquired by Sony, and Gaikai was bought by Sony for $380 million in 2012. The main problem that both companies faced, and in fact the main problem for any cloud gaming platform, is latency. When you‚Äôre playing a game streamed to the cloud, every command you make needs to be sent to the nearest server of the platform, computed, and sent back to your device. Even on very fast broadband, this takes up enough time to be noticeable, particularly in a fast-paced FPS such as Battlefield. There‚Äôs a slight delay for everything you do, and it makes playing a game much less enjoyable. Additionally, streaming a game in full HD in 60 FPS to a PC requires broadband of at least 25 Mbps or more, and can easily eat up multiple GBs of your data. Your ISP might slow down your connection when it notices you‚Äôre draining its network so badly. Finally, it‚Äôs not easy for the cloud gaming platform either, because they need to make sure their hardware is always up-to-date. Cloud gaming simply means that the requirement to almost continuously upgrade your hardware shifts from the consumer to the cloud gaming platform. If you don‚Äôt have enough users paying you a monthly fee for your service, this requirement to upgrade can quickly become financially untenable.Can Blockchain Technology Help? Blockchain technology can help solve one of the above problems: it allows people to lease their PC hardware to gamers streaming a game on a cloud gaming platform. Think of it as a peer-to-peer video game streaming service. This way, the cloud gaming platform can mitigate some of the cost that comes with always having to upgrade hardware. A smart contract on the blockchain can be used to determine the relationship between the gamer and the PC owner, and the owner would also receive a reward for leasing their hardware, in a way that‚Äôs similar to mining on a traditional blockchain. The above is how the Russian blockchain project Playkey operates. It‚Äôs a blockchain-based cloud gaming platform that allows you to stream a game in full HD and 60 FPS to your PC. The company raised $7 million from VCs and business angels, and it raised $10.5 million during an ICO for its cryptocurrency PKT. You can already use their platform, but it‚Äôs still a bit clunky and buggy at the moment. I tried to play Fortnite and definitely experienced some of the latency that all platforms suffer from, although this has much more to do with my relatively slow broadband connection than it has to do with the Playkey platform itself.What Are Other Companies Offering? As far as I know, Playkey is the only blockchain project that‚Äôs trying to tackle cloud gaming. But it has some serious competitors that aren‚Äôt blockchain-based. The two major ones right now are NVIDIA‚Äôs Geforce Now and PlayStation Now (built by Sony, using Gaikai‚Äôs technology). Google is working on a cloud streaming project too, where you‚Äôll be able to stream a game directly in the Chrome browser (how cool is that). Not much is known about Google‚Äôs service yet, but there are rumors that Google will unveil more during its tech event on March 19 this year. Smaller players are LiquidSky, Parsec, and Vortex. Cloud gaming feels like the natural direction for gaming to go in. It‚Äôs easy to envision a future where you can play any game without having to worry about computer hardware, where you just click and go. A Netflix for games. While we‚Äôre still bumping into bandwidth limitations and latency problems right now, it will only be a matter of time before broadband will be fast enough to clear those issues too. Blockchain technology can reward people who have powerful hardware, so hardware requirements don‚Äôt fall entirely on the cloud streaming platform. Particularly for people who don‚Äôt really need that hardware, it‚Äôs an efficient way to use their spare computing power. A P2P video game streaming platform might be preferable over a centralized gaming platform. I‚Äôm certainly excited about a future where games can be streamed to my computing device without noticeable latency. I‚Äôd happily pay a monthly fee for it, too. And I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one. There‚Äôs a huge market for cloud gaming. Once the technical limitations are cleared away and people have access to faster broadband, cloud gaming could spread like wildfire around the world.","unknown","","15","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GmJzND3S-OQtKiNJITYipDaK0j9_05AKRdHK--BpLMJIkC1Ul-SfRP7nGCt9p-3qbQfAMklZ8TjhecFReKq06AWGT80xm_U7PSMBTnESVdz8of9q0MvIS5c4yV70VQ3T3OvlScWV, https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ipVq0-dDTQwO6dfBccIbjijpwhN67NRIVNhPr6A0q8EbiOACgacSbsc72zwUTO816OkVebqGRkTVLXbyoeTztXIfaUhR-sJKDoRF0Q-0HjQVaf2V_b_yk-v8mL1z1JQNJt-IwSy2","","0","https://dgaming.com/does-the-future-of-gaming-lie-in-the-cloud/","0","0","","","0","238403123480","","false","","","","","","","0","","0","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-01T12:57:01.523+0000","","0.0","0"

This is yet another topic about game dev.

Before you start reading, a bit of context (correct me if I'm wrong): three weeks ago, ThePile ""appeared"" in the development part of the game and hyped a few people to continue the development of the game (see http://darkspace.net/index.htm'module=forums.php&page=/viewtopic.php&topic=54919&forum=285) , including me.

Since then, the Discord channel is pretty active, mostly in the dev section and that makes me happy to see people still care about this game. 
I even played it a few hours these last couple of days.

All of that is great but in order to move on, we actually need to know what to do. 
Maybe some of you know and it's somewhere in their head, but since it doesn't seem to be written somewhere, for me (and probably others), it doesn't exist.

I think the point of open sourcing the game is to try to get a bit more contributors and players if possible. 
Or at least make the game more enjoyable for those who play from time to time, or daily.

I see a lot of talk on Discord about features or adjustments, for example: Ships balance. 
Players talk about it from time to time but if there is something I learned on my side: talking about huge features or huge ""game logic change"" like this one on a live chat is often not the right solution: it's hard for people to remember what have been said a few days ago and they won't be able to easily find back what was said. 
What I mean by that is: we may be better using the forums for such topics. 
Do not hesitate to create a topic to request comments from other players about what you have in mind (you could tag them [RFC], ""request for comments"" for example).

The other topic I ""often"" see is the on-boarding of new players and the UI that might be a little too complex.

I didn't see much talk about how we could improve it. 
This talk might also be better in a topic, at least to ask players opinions and from there, take actions (or not).

Other than that, there are a few bug fixes to do and some ground work with the resourcer, which I'll probably try do this week if nothing else pops up.

All in all, if you have ideas, do not hesitate to express them, create topics about it so people can tell their opinions. 
Some features will take months to be decided, others a few hours. 
But that's how it works and at least we will have somewhere to move forward to, which IMHO, is not the case for now.

And I encourage you to comment on this post if you disagree about something, if I said something wrong or if I'm a complete moron.

PS: now that the game is open source, it's (partially) up to the community to decide where the game goes. 
And you are the community. 
Every idea or opinion matters

PS2: I didn't talk much about bugs: if you see some, reporting in the dev channel on Discord or through a topic is fine for me. 
And if it's not a bug, maybe it's a game logic problem.

inb4 ""FIX KLUTH AI SPAWNZSS"" (spoiler alert: for me there are no bugs)

EDIT: for suggestions, you can make a topic here http://darkspace.net/index.htm'module=forums.php&page=/viewforum.php'forum=36&25365 but please search for an existing topic and bump it if needed

i myself (having no experiance in development of any game) have wanted to get into the development of a game. 
when i read darkspace went to open source i was glad that i could have my chance. 
tho i have no idea where to start even if its a rough guide someone could post would be helpful. 
could anyone be willing to help get me there? 
thanks in advance love this game hope to see it continue.

-NICON-

p.s. time is not an issue for me when im not working im always doing a project and id like this to be a project i can work on. 
plus i can usually learn anything fairly quickly.

Posted: 2018-02-07 08:31 honestly what killed it for me was taking away elite npc's and most of the npc population. the game is low population player base as it is and that just made it boring.

bring back npc populations with elite npcs and make the maps bigger!!!

i miss the old map....

Posted: 2018-02-07 14:12 The beta server is updated before the production servers, to test features and fix bugs. 
The few last releases didn't get tested on the beta server but this was a bug and we did not want that to happen. 
It is now fixed.

As for the npc population you're talking about I'm not sure I've been around long enough to know what that is :/

_________________

Posted: 2018-02-07 16:36 ther used to be NPC dreads, stations and all other class of ships even interdictors that spawned in the perspective factions home system.... this was a viable way to lvl up combat and actualy do combat instead of chasing down recon and troop carriers like now. 
i think this is a important feature that should be returned to the game considering the player base is super low. 
gives newer players an incentive to keep playing and allows them to rank up faster.

whoever is involved in the development of this game should take my advice...

stop making changes to game mechanics that already work and focus on making the game more populated. 
i don't know if its a server issue not being able to handle the load, but i feel populating the game fixing a few bugs and focusing on updating the website are more important to the survival of the game. 
i want to see new players coming in and them actualy having something do do other than ""try"" to build a planet. 
or ""try"" to bomb a planet. 
i do agree that ecm and eccm need some adjustments but i don't think messing with the cloak is an effective way of doing so. 
ICC ships stacking ecm is just as effective and as a cloak if not more so. 
they need stacking penalties and the ability to switch out more of the auxiliary modules with more variety.

on another note

I'm not happy with the timer on these cloaks either. 
i know trying to do it with energy vs time was tried and failed but 90 seconds is hardly enough time to maneuver and stay undetected. the element of surprise is halved from this change. 
i understand that perma cloaks are a pain in the arse as a ugto player but i think you guys went about it all wrong. 
you need to fix the modules that help detect the cloak, like beacons and eccm instead of hating on k'luth and nerfing their power and in turn driving away all the k'luth players. 
you guys aren't bringing the game back to life your adjusting game mechanics to fit your own personal needs.

food for thought.................

maybe try and get the game added on steam!?!?

Players rank up to play with dreads and stations and some with cruisers, imagine if a fight is 2 sistems away how long will make to get there ?? Well i get bored to travel 10 minutes foa 1 mi ute fight. 
The second thing that i dont like is that torpedos range is very , very low. 
It used to be a longer range with less damage and it really made the game more imterested. 
Oh and the last one is planet dences ....planets are useless, dictors on them aint working , bombing and killing a planet is for any newb and is very easy. 
No pd like it used to be. 
So in my opinion the game should get better not worse. 
Trust me if this changes take place you will see alot of people back. 
Till then ill play Ps4 games! 
Have a good day !

Not sure how feasible that would be though. 
For instance rearranging the target window from the lower right hand corner to somewhere more immediately visible is one thing I might suggest as a specific. 
It gets rather difficult to see when there is a lot going on in the game.

yes!!!! these are things that need to be fixed. 
maybe have short rang and long range torpedoe variants for playstyle. 
and dictors not working.... lots of things that are broken and every one is interested in changing snap that already works.

seems like the current people developing are just using a dead game to mess around with a toy with... not thinking about the big picture... this game could be great. 
but no one realy has the intention of making it so.

i sence sarcasm in a effort to dismiss a truly good idea. 
this wouldn't hurt the game anymore than its hurting. 
you guys are killing me with your fiddle faddle bull snap..

get a select few people to be developers get rid of gameCQ fly under a new banner close the open dev and submit it to steam.

i don't know jack snap about code but i know how game mechanics affect game play on a bigger scale. 
ive seen many game come and go...

this is all i will say cuz it feel like there already are a select few doing the dev and they don't seem interested in making any actual fixes to the game. 
they just want to tweak the stats and play around with it.

Posted: 2018-02-08 07:06 Hello to all,

Thanks for the feedback.

I edited my first message so you know where to put the suggestions. 
I won't take a position for or against what you say because I don't have the required knowledge of the game, the players do. 
But having a thread PER suggestion will help the discussion, instead of having multiple subjects into one huge messed up thread.

Also, please note something: For some time now, the development of the game (if any) has been done on people own free time. 
By free time, I mean ""after work hours"", or ""during rainy weekends"", or ""whenever the dev felt like s.he wanted to do something"".

Hence, it's quite useless to blame ""devs"" for not making the game better. 
Instead, be supportive! 
Anyone can now contribute and if there is something you don't like, feel free to do it yourself, we would be very glad

Posted: 2018-02-10 00:35 the distance required for MIRV bombs to be dropable could be adjusted from the 100 gu it is now to something more reasonable like 25 or 30 gu, i just find that being a close orbit bombing specialist is harder than it needs to be b/c the moment the distence drops under 100 gu the bombs won't fire. 
thank you for all your hard work.

peace out

I have a case and decent 500w power supply I was going to reuse, unless there's some compelling reason to upgrade the PS now. I'm mainly just torn between getting more CPU cores and more memory, or getting a faster CPU/memory now. Frankly, though, I only rarely max out the 8 GB I have now, and if I get 16 GB with the option to easily add more later, that's probably fine. I'm just constantly kicking myself for not splurging for 16 GB when I bought this current motherboard. I think you're right, though, in that my experience will be better if I spend the extra money on an SSD rather than more RAM.","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/avwlxo/upgrade_advice_ryzen_build_to_replace_6_yr_old_a6/ehjflk2/#5910e9fd0.ehjflk2","0","0","","","0","238363599743","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-01T07:21:03.973+0000","","0.0","4971"

This was me 5 months ago, completely hollow: [https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/9ti4o5/i\_just\_finish\_dark\_souls\_the\_first\_time\_in\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/9ti4o5/i_just_finish_dark_souls_the_first_time_in_my/) And now after free Gerhman from his eternal duty and get rewarded by lord SONY: \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/0gjVwwP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0gjVwwP.jpg)), I am back with a lot of things in my mind. First I want to talk a little about my gaming life, I played video games since I was a kid. Warcraft 3, Heroes 3, Mario, Resident Evil 1, Zelda, God of War, Call of Duty, Mass Effect ... It was fun till I get to highschool, the only game I still played was Dota 1, and later SMITE, mostly because my friends play them as well. I found more fun when playing with real people than against AI. I found even more fun for doing other thing like hang out, learning history, food, make love ... than playing offline games. I thought to myself I will never love offline games again. Next I want to talk about ""How I met Soulsborne"". That was a party between ""long time no see highschool friends"" 5 months ago. A dude show me a soundtrack name ""Cleric Beast"". I listened to that, wow, I feel the need to slaughter something, don't feel that much adrenaline for quite a while. A little bit about me here: I would like to call myself a ""Epic Music"" lover, I can listen to music for from Hans Zimmer, Clint Mansell, Two Steps From Hell, Audiomachine ... all days. So I asked him ""Is that the FINAL boss theme ?"", he said ""No, is the FIRST boss"". No ways, is must be joking. He said, If I don't believe him, go try that for myself. I go back home that day, doing some google, well Bloodborne is just a spiritual sequel, we need to Demon Souls - Dark Souls 1/2/3 - Bloodborne. My journey begins. I don't own a PS3 at that time, PS Now won't support my country, and look, Dark Souls Remastered just released on Steam. Later then Demon Souls, I will back to you later (that ""later"" mean 3 months) :D Omg, wat is dis. Broken Straight Sword ? In the trailer, I suppose to have at least a longsword. Well, this could be some kind of dream, and when I get out this, I will have a proper sword. Wat is dis again ? A boss at the start of the game ??? My weapon deal like 10 dmg against him. Damn this look not ok. Suddenly I remember Resident Evil, a game which you shoudn't fight everything you see. Then I see that little hallways, haha, we can bypass this boss, I am such a genius. I entered that hallways, look back to the Asylum Demon, you dumb, can't get to me in here. Suddenly, he swing his hammer, it's go through all walls then slap in my head. First dead. You guys can imagine what happen next. Dead by sword. Dead by arrow. Dead by fire. Dead by drowned. Dead by ghost. Dead by lightning. Dead by toxic. Dead by poison. Dead by gravity. Dead by trying to see what happen If you attack NPC ... You named them. You dead, you loose all Souls you hardly earned. You dead, you back from the start. At first It really frustating. But then I see an item named Dark Sign. Use this, you back to the start, loose the stuff you hardly earned. I remember a quote in the trailer ""Dead is my friend"". Oh It make senses now, I started consider dead is just a part of this game, same with failure is just a part of life. You either accept them, take lesson from that, move on. Or let them get into your head, make you loose the will to fight, until you go full hollow aka rage quit. Suddenly everything feel much and much easier. Thanks to you Soulsborne, you help me find my forgotten love. Now here is some of my silly list, with a little of consult from my girlfriend, who is the first time since I met her enjoy watching me play video games. Please take this with a lot of salt. Also there is some SPOILER after this part, so turn back If you haven't played the games. Top 10 bosses in all Soulsborne, a very hard list to make. I rate them via lore, fair, difficulty, design, fun, boss fight arena, and the most important, music. This is based on my experience with them solo only, no guide in first playthrough, completely offline, mix with ng and ng+. 1. Lothric and Lorian. Fight me with this. I know for you guys there is a lot of boss better than these cripple brothers: Gael, Friede, Midir, Nameless King, Soul of Cinder, Alonne, Artorias, Manus, Gascoigne, Gerhman, Ludwig, Kos, Maria, ... First he feel fair to fight against. He doesn't have nearly infinite stamina like Friede, Kos ..., after 2-3 swing, he always need some time to regain his stamina. He doesn't have any move which doing nothing or useless stuff (Artorias slowly turn back at you, Nameless buffing his spear and in the end call a lightning which miss 99% of time, Dancer keep walking around showing you her ass ...) Literally every move he did, you can do the same, except the teleport, but that make up for he can't move normally and roll like you. Nearly everything applied to you also applied to him. You can even parry his one hand attack If you skilled enough. And that music, I believe If even a no-gamer like my girlfriend enjoy that, It gotta be real good. 2. Gerhman, The First Hunter. Maria will never as good as her teacher. For me, Maria is just a R1 spammer, which forgot the existence of her gun. She did sometime use that, but overall, she just abuse her abnormal long quickstep and spam R1 to win. Look at her mentor, Gerhman, he slowly walk at you, fathom you, toying you around with gun, then suddenly use his combo. Did I mention you the first reason I play this series, the music ? I feel his triumph, his lost, his pain, all in one song. Second best soundtrack in Bloodborne for me. 3. Gael. He lived through the War with the Dragons. He lived through The First Age of Fire. He lived through thousand of thousand circle of linking the fire, watching thousand of thousand kingdom rise and fall with it. But in the end, his final battle, he fought an Ash, unfit even to be a Cinder, in a middle of nowhere, just for a promise he can't no longer keep. I don't think we can ask for a more epicness. Fun thing about this fight I noticed, in all Souls game, the Lightning is always yellow: Gwyn's lightning is yellow in the trailer, all your LIghtning's spells are yellow as well. But only in this fight, the Lightning is white/blue, which is the same color in Bloodborne. I would like to think that mean somehow Bloodborne is a Dark Souls true sequel, not just a coincidence. 4. Sir Alonne. Only one word to say about this fight: beautiful, everything is so beautiful It hurt. The clean floor you can even mirror yourself in, the sunset light through the windows, and the calmly samurai peacefully sitting in middle all of it. Fighting him is not so hard, just a normal hit one and dodge fight, but I can sure that was a fight you never forget. 5. Champion Gundyr, without parry him. First, let's talk about my fight against Ludex Gundyr. I finished Dark Souls 1 and half of Dark Souls 2 before I get to Dark Souls 3. I finished him in like 30 second, right before the music start kicking good, without using a single Estus. Damn, that was like make love but you can't shoot your load. Now I see you again, what the fuck is this, not a single moveset change at all ? At that moment, I even think ""Ludex"" mean ""Champion"" in Latin, because they literally fighting the same way. This could be some kind of joke, Miyazaki must be in smoke when direct these part of the game. Oh wait, he just slam to the ground ! Is that mean phase 2 begin ? All other bosses have some kind of anime moves/effects when changing phase, Abyss Watchers make fire from a bloodied sword, Dancer pull a new sword from the ground, Nameless King butchered his own pet then stand cool before the camera ... And the only thing this dude did, just one slam to the ground with a very small effect. No anime roaring, no transformation, no cutscenes, just a slam. OH FUCK, what is this no stamina nonsense, can you give me a break. Oh thanks, I can Estus now. Wait what ? You leap on me when I drink Estus ? Please just stand still for a moment, we all have to drink ... From that day, though he is an optional boss, he become a main boss in my list. 6. Father Gascoigne. You simply can't hate him. He is very fair to fight, everything applied to him also applied to you: stamina, poise, moveset, parriable, hp bar, you can even mimic his phase 2 with Beast Claw. From the lore viewpoint, knowing you can use Tiny Music Box to stun him is a big wow. Is he challenge ? For a dude like me which already beat all Souls before go to Bloodborne, is still a decent fight. That was the fight forced me to play the Bloodborne way, not Dark Souls way: dancing around your prey, finding their weakness, then strike them hard. For a girl like my girlfriend which only watching me play the series before, that was the first time after 1 year in love I saw her rub her head and slam her hand that hard. The best part of this fight is the boss's theme. In the official OST album, It is not called ""Father Gascoigne"", it is ""The Hunter"". I think It describe a hunt, which is also the main point of the game, perfectly. The first part is just foreplay, the hunter and the beast PROBE each other. This PROBE part take 2/3 duration of the song, longer than 2nd part, but I think that is quite realistic, understand your prey will always take much longer than the kill itself. Then boom, shit get real, THE HUNT part. The prey run, the hunter begin to chase, ferociously. But just one mistake, the hunter will be hunted instead. Best Bloodborne OST for me. 7. Yhorm, but no Storm Ruler. A lot of people will not agree with me here, so please take time and hear my story. We all feel hyped when we see Yhorm in the trailer. Finally after a messy annoy prison and ruined capital, we meet him. I swear to you guys, that was the first time my katana broke in DS3. So slash my way to victory is not an option here. I suddenly see the Storm Ruler. It blown my mind at first. Yhorm died after a few shot from Storm Ruler. But then I try that weapon on normal mobs. Why is this so weak, the weapon art can take down a giant, but can't take down a low life undead ? The first time in my Soulsborne course, I feel really sorry for a boss. A great giant get beaten by a sword so crappy can't even scratch a normal mob. I have to fight against him normally in NG+. You may not believe me, but I actually broke my Uchigatana, Lothric Knight Sword, Hollow Slayer Greatsword just to take down him. You know what is the fun part ? After that fight, I did some google, oh my god, I did this fight a wrong way all the time. I suppose to hit his head and his hand, not his leg. I have to try again. And that bring more fun than I thought when I figured how to do. The most unique Soulsborne experience I ever had. 8. Watchdog of the Old Lords, the FRC dungeon version. Some say this fight is bullshit. Some say this fight is totally unfair. Some even say It design for you to rage quit. Let me tell you this, I consider this is the ""git gud"" point of Bloodborne. This fight forced you to play as a hunter, mean you can't trade hit with your prey, you can't overpower your prey with higher level, you HAVE TO learn your prey to beat him. Even when you learnt them, shit can still happen, one mistake and you die. 9. Sister Friede. My first playthrough with Dark Souls 3 takes 49 hours, and the last 20 hours was nothing but Friede keep ""snuff out these ashes for good"". You guys can just read my history with her here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/aejtcq/i\_just\_beat\_sister\_friede\_after\_20\_hours\_just/](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/aejtcq/i_just_beat_sister_friede_after_20_hours_just/) 10. Artorias. Finally a Dark Souls 1 boss. This dude is the perfect Dark Souls 1 for me. Through the main game, we keep hearing about his legend. He is like the biggest mystery in Dark Souls 1. Then we finally have the chance to fight him. To be fair, he is not so hard. But the arena, the music theme, the way he fight you, and especially the lore behind him, I am pretty sure he is the best boss in Dark Souls 1. Top 10 moments in Soulsborne 1. Sister Friede phase 3: Did anyone like me, finished her phase 2, go to inventory, equip Symbol of Avarice, Shield of Want and Silver Ring of Covetous, waiting for those juicy money then ""boom"", immediately die without knowing why ? I bet there is someone out there in the Souls community did the same. 2. Gough shot down Kalameet. This scene will always take a special place in my heart. Through the franchise, we heard countless story about legend slaying dragons, legend fighting the abyss, legend slaying the demons. But this is the only time in the series, we see a legend in action with our own eyes. An old lonely blind giant waiting for his days over, slowly stand up, grab his bow, take one deep breath, then shot down a fucking flying dragon. If that was not epic enough for you, I don't know what can. 3. First time seeing Anor Londo. I will just quote my girlfriend here: ""Wow"". There is nothing much to say about this, even a blind man can see the beautiful of Anor Londo. 4. Finally found the Skull Lantern in Tomb of The Giants. I heard people hate Blightown. I heard some hate Anor Londo's archers. I totally get that. But for me, this is the most memorable part in my Dark Souls 1's journey. Miyazaki gonna have a very big ball for making a map when you literally can't see more than 1cm around you. Did I mention you this map have dog can one shot you ? Or perma Anor Londo's archer ? ... Then finally we got the lantern, omg, I was so relieve, finally I can see, I never loved a simply lamp like that, more than any lamp in my life. You guys should try wandering in the darkness of the Tomb without any light at least once to understand what I mean, especially those have friends who about to play Dark Souls :D 5. Found the first true shortcut from Upper Undead Burg to Firelink Shrine. Let see, we just got through a bunch of Hollow Soldier's rapefest. We beat a giant demon. We met a fellow named Solaire. We saw a ""dragon"" breathing fire for the first time. We survived another rapefest of Hollow Soldier. We stab a Steel Boar's ass. We take down some caped knights. Oh, is that an elevator ? Where is gonna take us ? We hop on it, raise our shield to prepare for whatever coming. Oh, this look familiar. Could this be ... Firelink Shrine ? No way, It is really Firelink Shrine!!! Relieve, relax, a little of shock, happy. After all those adventure, we back to the start. ! For me, world's design is the best point of Dark Souls 1. Dark Souls 1 don't have outstanding boss like Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 1 don't have the fluidity of combat like Bloodborne. But whoever make the world's design deserve an VGA for himself. Every stage/map before Anor Londo are all connected with each other via Firelink Shrine, and they all feel so natural, no rushed, no forced. A beautiful and genius design which sadly no other Soulsborne games can keep T.T 6. Soul of Cinder phase 2, three string notes. You can fight humans, monsters, dragons, gods ... But you just can't fight the feel. The first time you hear those notes, the game was about to end. The second time you hear those notes, the franchise was about to end. And after all, you still fighting the same old man who tried so hard to keep his kingdom. RIP 7. Found out about Great Hollow + Ash Lake. I completely miss these areas in my first playthrough. The moment I knew about them via wikidot, I was like ""wtf"", who on earth can found out about that place without a guide ? Illusory wall is sure one of the best thing in Soulsborne. 8. Bring down the hacker named Bloody Crow of Cainhurst. I fought him in NG+. For me, this dude is the hardest non FRC Chalice fight in the whole game. Let me make a comparison. I skipped the DLC in NG. I died against Ludwig 5 times, Living Failures 0, Maria 0, Kos 1, Lawrence 7. In the main game, the boss I have trouble most is Daughter of Cosmos, 4 dead by her . But all those number combined is only 1/4 of the times I was killed by that hacker. He had the health bar of a boss, infinite bullet to spam his gun and Old Hunter Bone, and If the god of rng bless him, he may use his Blood Vial up to 4 times, very very annoy and tedious. He was the only ""boss"" FORCED me to change my setup and playstyle. I removed my favorite Hunter's set, wear the Maria's set, the attire with highest Blood defense, though my hunter is a man. I stock a shitload of molotov, knife and poison knife. I equip all the regen gems on my right hand weapon, then only shoot him with the Blunderbuss + bomb + knife, never use my right hand weapon. It was a 25-30 minutes fight, but finally I take him down for my waifu Eileen. 9. Finish the first FRC Chalice. FRC Chalice is sure one of the best challenge in Bloodborne. Trap everywhere. Enemies nearly always go as a pack, and every single mob in that pack can one shot you. Did I have to mention the boss, more specifically the Hotdog ? It could take you hours to figure it out, some may days, weeks, months. But when you do, I guarantee that was one of the best moment in your gaming life. 10. The Burnt Ivory King entrance. First time I see his entrance, I can't stop myself thinking about Lord of The Rings. Pure badass and epic. My last top 10, and also the hardest top 10 to make, top 10 songs in Soulsborne, which is the very first reason I come to this series. 1. Dark Souls 3 main menu theme 2. Prince Lorian and Lothric's theme 3. Father Gascoigne's theme 4. One Who Craved Souls - unless you already play Demon's Souls, I bet not much of you guys heard this masterpiece. Give that a chance, you won't disappoint, I promise. 5. Gerhman's theme 6. Gundyr's theme 7. Gael's theme 8. Friede's theme 9. Ludwig's theme 10. Cleric Beast's theme, but with his scream :D. The OST itself is already good, but with his scream, It goes to another level. Thanks for reading guys, I just want to share. Let all sit here and wait for Sekiro will be better than Soulsborne","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/aw1gt5/i_just_finished_all_soulsborne_games_just_want_to/#58125d643.aw1gt5","0","0","","","0","238356400044","","false","","","","","","post","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-01T06:11:24.787+0000","","0.0","4971"

This was me 5 months ago, completely hollow: [https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/9ti4o5/i\_just\_finish\_dark\_souls\_the\_first\_time\_in\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/9ti4o5/i_just_finish_dark_souls_the_first_time_in_my/) And now after free Gerhman from his eternal duty and get rewarded by lord SONY: \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/0gjVwwP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0gjVwwP.jpg)), I am back with a lot of things in my mind. First I want to talk a little about my gaming life, I played video games since I was a kid. Warcraft 3, Heroes 3, Mario, Resident Evil 1, Zelda, God of War, Call of Duty, Mass Effect ... It was fun till I get to highschool, the only game I still played was Dota 1, and later SMITE, mostly because my friends play them as well. I found more fun when playing with real people than against AI. I found even more fun for doing other thing like hang out, learning history, food, make love ... than playing offline games. I thought to myself I will never love offline games again. Next I want to talk about ""How I met Soulsborne"". That was a party between ""long time no see highschool friends"" 5 months ago. A dude show me a soundtrack name ""Cleric Beast"". I listened to that, wow, I feel the need to slaughter something, don't feel that much adrenaline for quite a while. A little bit about me here: I would like to call myself a ""Epic Music"" lover, I can listen to music for from Hans Zimmer, Clint Mansell, Two Steps From Hell, Audiomachine ... all days. So I asked him ""Is that the FINAL boss theme ?"", he said ""No, is the FIRST boss"". No ways, is must be joking. He said, If I don't believe him, go try that for myself. I go back home that day, doing some google, well Bloodborne is just a spiritual sequel, we need to Demon Souls - Dark Souls 1/2/3 - Bloodborne. My journey begins. I don't own a PS3 at that time, PS Now won't support my country, and look, Dark Souls Remastered just released on Steam. Later then Demon Souls, I will back to you later (that ""later"" mean 3 months) :D Omg, wat is dis. Broken Straight Sword ? In the trailer, I suppose to have at least a longsword. Well, this could be some kind of dream, and when I get out this, I will have a proper sword. Wat is dis again ? A boss at the start of the game ??? My weapon deal like 10 dmg against him. Damn this look not ok. Suddenly I remember Resident Evil, a game which you shoudn't fight everything you see. Then I see that little hallways, haha, we can bypass this boss, I am such a genius. I entered that hallways, look back to the Asylum Demon, you dumb, can't get to me in here. Suddenly, he swing his hammer, it's go through all walls then slap in my head. First dead. You guys can imagine what happen next. Dead by sword. Dead by arrow. Dead by fire. Dead by drowned. Dead by ghost. Dead by lightning. Dead by toxic. Dead by poison. Dead by gravity. Dead by trying to see what happen If you attack NPC ... You named them. You dead, you loose all Souls you hardly earned. You dead, you back from the start. At first It really frustating. But then I see an item named Dark Sign. Use this, you back to the start, loose the stuff you hardly earned. I remember a quote in the trailer ""Dead is my friend"". Oh It make senses now, I started consider dead is just a part of this game, same with failure is just a part of life. You either accept them, take lesson from that, move on. Or let them get into your head, make you loose the will to fight, until you go full hollow aka rage quit. Suddenly everything feel much and much easier. Thanks to you Soulsborne, you help me find my forgotten love. Now here is some of my silly list, with a little of consult from my girlfriend, who is the first time since I met her enjoy watching me play video games. Please take this with a lot of salt. Also there is some SPOILER after this part, so turn back If you haven't played the games. Top 10 bosses in all Soulsborne, a very hard list to make. I rate them via lore, fair, difficulty, design, fun, boss fight arena, and the most important, music. This is based on my experience with them solo only, no guide in first playthrough, completely offline, mix with ng and ng+. 1. Lothric and Lorian. Fight me with this. I know for you guys there is a lot of boss better than these cripple brothers: Gael, Friede, Midir, Nameless King, Soul of Cinder, Alonne, Artorias, Manus, Gascoigne, Gerhman, Ludwig, Kos, Maria, ... First he feel fair to fight against. He doesn't have nearly infinite stamina like Friede, Kos ..., after 2-3 swing, he always need some time to regain his stamina. He doesn't have any move which doing nothing or useless stuff (Artorias slowly turn back at you, Nameless buffing his spear and in the end call a lightning which miss 99% of time, Dancer keep walking around showing you her ass ...) Literally every move he did, you can do the same, except the teleport, but that make up for he can't move normally and roll like you. Nearly everything applied to you also applied to him. You can even parry his one hand attack If you skilled enough. And that music, I believe If even a no-gamer like my girlfriend enjoy that, It gotta be real good. 2. Gerhman, The First Hunter. Maria will never as good as her teacher. For me, Maria is just a R1 spammer, which forgot the existence of her gun. She did sometime use that, but overall, she just abuse her abnormal long quickstep and spam R1 to win. Look at her mentor, Gerhman, he slowly walk at you, fathom you, toying you around with gun, then suddenly use his combo. Did I mention you the first reason I play this series, the music ? I feel his triumph, his lost, his pain, all in one song. Second best soundtrack in Bloodborne for me. 3. Gael. He lived through the War with the Dragons. He lived through The First Age of Fire. He lived through thousand of thousand circle of linking the fire, watching thousand of thousand kingdom rise and fall with it. But in the end, his final battle, he fought an Ash, unfit even to be a Cinder, in a middle of nowhere, just for a promise he can't no longer keep. I don't think we can ask for a more epicness. Fun thing about this fight I noticed, in all Souls game, the Lightning is always yellow: Gwyn's lightning is yellow in the trailer, all your LIghtning's spells are yellow as well. But only in this fight, the Lightning is white/blue, which is the same color in Bloodborne. I would like to think that mean somehow Bloodborne is a Dark Souls true sequel, not just a coincidence. 4. Sir Alonne. Only one word to say about this fight: beautiful, everything is so beautiful It hurt. The clean floor you can even mirror yourself in, the sunset light through the windows, and the calmly samurai peacefully sitting in middle all of it. Fighting him is not so hard, just a normal hit one and dodge fight, but I can sure that was a fight you never forget. 5. Champion Gundyr, without parry him. First, let's talk about my fight against Ludex Gundyr. I finished Dark Souls 1 and half of Dark Souls 2 before I get to Dark Souls 3. I finished him in like 30 second, right before the music start kicking good, without using a single Estus. Damn, that was like make love but you can't shoot your load. Now I see you again, what the fuck is this, not a single moveset change at all ? At that moment, I even think ""Ludex"" mean ""Champion"" in Latin, because they literally fighting the same way. This could be some kind of joke, Miyazaki must be in smoke when direct these part of the game. Oh wait, he just slam to the ground ! Is that mean phase 2 begin ? All other bosses have some kind of anime moves/effects when changing phase, Abyss Watchers make fire from a bloodied sword, Dancer pull a new sword from the ground, Nameless King butchered his own pet then stand cool before the camera ... And the only thing this dude did, just one slam to the ground with a very small effect. No anime roaring, no transformation, no cutscenes, just a slam. OH FUCK, what is this no stamina nonsense, can you give me a break. Oh thanks, I can Estus now. Wait what ? You leap on me when I drink Estus ? Please just stand still for a moment, we all have to drink ... From that day, though he is an optional boss, he become a main boss in my list. 6. Father Gascoigne. You simply can't hate him. He is very fair to fight, everything applied to him also applied to you: stamina, poise, moveset, parriable, hp bar, you can even mimic his phase 2 with Beast Claw. From the lore viewpoint, knowing you can use Tiny Music Box to stun him is a big wow. Is he challenge ? For a dude like me which already beat all Souls before go to Bloodborne, is still a decent fight. That was the fight forced me to play the Bloodborne way, not Dark Souls way: dancing around your prey, finding their weakness, then strike them hard. For a girl like my girlfriend which only watching me play the series before, that was the first time after 1 year in love I saw her rub her head and slam her hand that hard. The best part of this fight is the boss's theme. In the official OST album, It is not called ""Father Gascoigne"", it is ""The Hunter"". I think It describe a hunt, which is also the main point of the game, perfectly. The first part is just foreplay, the hunter and the beast PROBE each other. This PROBE part take 2/3 duration of the song, longer than 2nd part, but I think that is quite realistic, understand your prey will always take much longer than the kill itself. Then boom, shit get real, THE HUNT part. The prey run, the hunter begin to chase, ferociously. But just one mistake, the hunter will be hunted instead. Best Bloodborne OST for me. 7. Yhorm, but no Storm Ruler. A lot of people will not agree with me here, so please take time and hear my story. We all feel hyped when we see Yhorm in the trailer. Finally after a messy annoy prison and ruined capital, we meet him. I swear to you guys, that was the first time my katana broke in DS3. So slash my way to victory is not an option here. I suddenly see the Storm Ruler. It blown my mind at first. Yhorm died after a few shot from Storm Ruler. But then I try that weapon on normal mobs. Why is this so weak, the weapon art can take down a giant, but can't take down a low life undead ? The first time in my Soulsborne course, I feel really sorry for a boss. A great giant get beaten by a sword so crappy can't even scratch a normal mob. I have to fight against him normally in NG+. You may not believe me, but I actually broke my Uchigatana, Lothric Knight Sword, Hollow Slayer Greatsword just to take down him. You know what is the fun part ? After that fight, I did some google, oh my god, I did this fight a wrong way all the time. I suppose to hit his head and his hand, not his leg. I have to try again. And that bring more fun than I thought when I figured how to do. The most unique Soulsborne experience I ever had. 8. Watchdog of the Old Lords, the FRC dungeon version. Some say this fight is bullshit. Some say this fight is totally unfair. Some even say It design for you to rage quit. Let me tell you this, I consider this is the ""git gud"" point of Bloodborne. This fight forced you to play as a hunter, mean you can't trade hit with your prey, you can't overpower your prey with higher level, you HAVE TO learn your prey to beat him. Even when you learnt them, shit can still happen, one mistake and you die. 9. Sister Friede. My first playthrough with Dark Souls 3 takes 49 hours, and the last 20 hours was nothing but Friede keep ""snuff out these ashes for good"". You guys can just read my history with her here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/aejtcq/i\_just\_beat\_sister\_friede\_after\_20\_hours\_just/](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/aejtcq/i_just_beat_sister_friede_after_20_hours_just/) 10. Artorias. Finally a Dark Souls 1 boss. This dude is the perfect Dark Souls 1 for me. Through the main game, we keep hearing about his legend. He is like the biggest mystery in Dark Souls 1. Then we finally have the chance to fight him. To be fair, he is not so hard. But the arena, the music theme, the way he fight you, and especially the lore behind him, I am pretty sure he is the best boss in Dark Souls 1. Top 10 moments in Soulsborne 1. Sister Friede phase 3: Did anyone like me, finished her phase 2, go to inventory, equip Symbol of Avarice, Shield of Want and Silver Ring of Covetous, waiting for those juicy money then ""boom"", immediately die without knowing why ? I bet there is someone out there in the Souls community did the same. 2. Gough shot down Kalameet. This scene will always take a special place in my heart. Through the franchise, we heard countless story about legend slaying dragons, legend fighting the abyss, legend slaying the demons. But this is the only time in the series, we see a legend in action with our own eyes. An old lonely blind giant waiting for his days over, slowly stand up, grab his bow, take one deep breath, then shot down a fucking flying dragon. If that was not epic enough for you, I don't know what can. 3. First time seeing Anor Londo. I will just quote my girlfriend here: ""Wow"". There is nothing much to say about this, even a blind man can see the beautiful of Anor Londo. 4. Finally found the Skull Lantern in Tomb of The Giants. I heard people hate Blightown. I heard some hate Anor Londo's archers. I totally get that. But for me, this is the most memorable part in my Dark Souls 1's journey. Miyazaki gonna have a very big ball for making a map when you literally can't see more than 1cm around you. Did I mention you this map have dog can one shot you ? Or perma Anor Londo's archer ? ... Then finally we got the lantern, omg, I was so relieve, finally I can see, I never loved a simply lamp like that, more than any lamp in my life. You guys should try wandering in the darkness of the Tomb without any light at least once to understand what I mean, especially those have friends who about to play Dark Souls :D 5. Found the first true shortcut from Upper Undead Burg to Firelink Shrine. Let see, we just got through a bunch of Hollow Soldier's rapefest. We beat a giant demon. We met a fellow named Solaire. We saw a ""dragon"" breathing fire for the first time. We survived another rapefest of Hollow Soldier. We stab a Steel Boar's ass. We take down some caped knights. Oh, is that an elevator ? Where is gonna take us ? We hop on it, raise our shield to prepare for whatever coming. Oh, this look familiar. Could this be ... Firelink Shrine ? No way, It is really Firelink Shrine!!! Relieve, relax, a little of shock, happy. After all those adventure, we back to the start. ! For me, world's design is the best point of Dark Souls 1. Dark Souls 1 don't have outstanding boss like Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 1 don't have the fluidity of combat like Bloodborne. But whoever make the world's design deserve an VGA for himself. Every stage/map before Anor Londo are all connected with each other via Firelink Shrine, and they all feel so natural, no rushed, no forced. A beautiful and genius design which sadly no other Soulsborne games can keep T.T 6. Soul of Cinder phase 2, three string notes. You can fight humans, monsters, dragons, gods ... But you just can't fight the feel. The first time you hear those notes, the game was about to end. The second time you hear those notes, the franchise was about to end. And after all, you still fighting the same old man who tried so hard to keep his kingdom. RIP 7. Found out about Great Hollow + Ash Lake. I completely miss these areas in my first playthrough. The moment I knew about them via wikidot, I was like ""wtf"", who on earth can found out about that place without a guide ? Illusory wall is sure one of the best thing in Soulsborne. 8. Bring down the hacker named Bloody Crow of Cainhurst. I fought him in NG+. For me, this dude is the hardest non FRC Chalice fight in the whole game. Let me make a comparison. I skipped the DLC in NG. I died against Ludwig 5 times, Living Failures 0, Maria 0, Kos 1, Lawrence 7. In the main game, the boss I have trouble most is Daughter of Cosmos, 4 dead by her . But all those number combined is only 1/4 of the times I was killed by that hacker. He had the health bar of a boss, infinite bullet to spam his gun and Old Hunter Bone, and If the god of rng bless him, he may use his Blood Vial up to 4 times, very very annoy and tedious. He was the only ""boss"" FORCED me to change my setup and playstyle. I removed my favorite Hunter's set, wear the Maria's set, the attire with highest Blood defense, though my hunter is a man. I stock a shitload of molotov, knife and poison knife. I equip all the regen gems on my right hand weapon, then only shoot him with the Blunderbuss + bomb + knife, never use my right hand weapon. It was a 25-30 minutes fight, but finally I take him down for my waifu Eileen. 9. Finish the first FRC Chalice. FRC Chalice is sure one of the best challenge in Bloodborne. Trap everywhere. Enemies nearly always go as a pack, and every single mob in that pack can one shot you. Did I have to mention the boss, more specifically the Hotdog ? It could take you hours to figure it out, some may days, weeks, months. But when you do, I guarantee that was one of the best moment in your gaming life. 10. The Burnt Ivory King entrance. First time I see his entrance, I can't stop myself thinking about Lord of The Rings. Pure badass and epic. My last top 10, and also the hardest top 10 to make, top 10 songs in Soulsborne, which is the very first reason I come to this series. 1. Dark Souls 3 main menu theme 2. Prince Lorian and Lothric's theme 3. Father Gascoigne's theme 4. One Who Craved Souls - unless you already play Demon's Souls, I bet not much of you guys heard this masterpiece. Give that a chance, you won't disappoint, I promise. 5. Gerhman's theme 6. Gundyr's theme 7. Gael's theme 8. Friede's theme 9. Ludwig's theme 10. Cleric Beast's theme, but with his scream :D. The OST itself is already good, but with his scream, It goes to another level. Thanks for reading guys, I just want to share.

All other bosses have some kind of anime moves/effects when changing phase, Abyss Watchers make fire from a bloodied sword, Dancer pull a new sword from the ground, Nameless King butchered his own pet then stand cool before the camera ... And the only thing this dude did, just one slam to the ground with a very small effect. No anime roaring, no transformation, no cutscenes, just a slam. OH FUCK, what is this no stamina nonsense, can you give me a break. Oh thanks, I can Estus now. Wait what ? You leap on me when I drink Estus ? Please just stand still for a moment, we all have to drink ... From that day, though he is an optional boss, he become a main boss in my list. 6. Father Gascoigne. You simply can't hate him. He is very fair to fight, everything applied to him also applied to you: stamina, poise, moveset, parriable, hp bar, you can even mimic his phase 2 with Beast Claw. From the lore viewpoint, knowing you can use Tiny Music Box to stun him is a big wow. Is he challenge ? For a dude like me which already beat all Souls before go to Bloodborne, is still a decent fight. That was the fight forced me to play the Bloodborne way, not Dark Souls way: dancing around your prey, finding their weakness, then strike them hard. For a girl like my girlfriend which only watching me play the series before, that was the first time after 1 year in love I saw her rub her head and slam her hand that hard. The best part of this fight is the boss's theme. In the official OST album, It is not called ""Father Gascoigne"", it is ""The Hunter"". I think It describe a hunt, which is also the main point of the game, perfectly. The first part is just foreplay, the hunter and the beast PROBE each other. This PROBE part take 2/3 duration of the song, longer than 2nd part, but I think that is quite realistic, understand your prey will always take much longer than the kill itself. Then boom, shit get real, THE HUNT part. The prey run, the hunter begin to chase, ferociously. But just one mistake, the hunter will be hunted instead. Best Bloodborne OST for me. 7. Yhorm, but no Storm Ruler. A lot of people will not agree with me here, so please take time and hear my story. We all feel hyped when we see Yhorm in the trailer. Finally after a messy annoy prison and ruined capital, we meet him. I swear to you guys, that was the first time my katana broke in DS3. So slash my way to victory is not an option here. I suddenly see the Storm Ruler. It blown my mind at first. Yhorm died after a few shot from Storm Ruler. But then I try that weapon on normal mobs. Why is this so weak, the weapon art can take down a giant, but can't take down a low life undead ? The first time in my Soulsborne course, I feel really sorry for a boss. A great giant get beaten by a sword so crappy can't even scratch a normal mob. I have to fight against him normally in NG+. You may not believe me, but I actually broke my Uchigatana, Lothric Knight Sword, Hollow Slayer Greatsword just to take down him. You know what is the fun part ? After that fight, I did some google, oh my god, I did this fight a wrong way all the time. I suppose to hit his head and his hand, not his leg. I have to try again. And that bring more fun than I thought when I figured how to do. The most unique Soulsborne experience I ever had. 8. Watchdog of the Old Lords, the FRC dungeon version. Some say this fight is bullshit. Some say this fight is totally unfair. Some even say It design for you to rage quit. Let me tell you this, I consider this is the ""git gud"" point of Bloodborne. This fight forced you to play as a hunter, mean you can't trade hit with your prey, you can't overpower your prey with higher level, you HAVE TO learn your prey to beat him. Even when you learnt them, shit can still happen, one mistake and you die. 9. Sister Friede. My first playthrough with Dark Souls 3 takes 49 hours, and the last 20 hours was nothing but Friede keep ""snuff out these ashes for good"". You guys can just read my history with her here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/aejtcq/i\_just\_beat\_sister\_friede\_after\_20\_hours\_just/](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/aejtcq/i_just_beat_sister_friede_after_20_hours_just/) 10. Artorias. Finally a Dark Souls 1 boss. This dude is the perfect Dark Souls 1 for me. Through the main game, we keep hearing about his legend. He is like the biggest mystery in Dark Souls 1. Then we finally have the chance to fight him. To be fair, he is not so hard. But the arena, the music theme, the way he fight you, and especially the lore behind him, I am pretty sure he is the best boss in Dark Souls 1. ‚Äã Top 10 moments in Soulsborne 1. Sister Friede phase 3: Did anyone like me, finished her phase 2, go to inventory, equip Symbol of Avarice, Shield of Want and Silver Ring of Covetous, waiting for those juicy money then ""boom"", immediately die without knowing why ? I bet there is someone out there in the Souls community did the same. 2. Gough shot down Kalameet. This scene will always take a special place in my heart. Through the franchise, we heard countless story about legend slaying dragons, legend fighting the abyss, legend slaying the demons. But this is the only time in the series, we see a legend in action with our own eyes. An old lonely blind giant waiting for his days over, slowly stand up, grab his bow, take one deep breath, then shot down a fucking flying dragon. If that was not epic enough for you, I don't know what can. 3. First time seeing Anor Londo. I will just quote my girlfriend here: ""Wow"". There is nothing much to say about this, even a blind man can see the beautiful of Anor Londo. 4. Finally found the Skull Lantern in Tomb of The Giants. I heard people hate Blightown. I heard some hate Anor Londo's archers. I totally get that. But for me, this is the most memorable part in my Dark Souls 1's journey. Miyazaki gonna have a very big ball for making a map when you literally can't see more than 1cm around you. Did I mention you this map have dog can one shot you ? Or perma Anor Londo's archer ? ... Then finally we got the lantern, omg, I was so relieve, finally I can see, I never loved a simply lamp like that, more than any lamp in my life. You guys should try wandering in the darkness of the Tomb without any light at least once to understand what I mean, especially those have friends who about to play Dark Souls :D 5. Found the first true shortcut from Upper Undead Burg to Firelink Shrine. Let see, we just got through a bunch of Hollow Soldier's rapefest. We beat a giant demon. We met a fellow named Solaire. We saw a ""dragon"" breathing fire for the first time. We survived another rapefest of Hollow Soldier. We stab a Steel Boar's ass. We take down some caped knights. Oh, is that an elevator ? Where is gonna take us ? We hop on it, raise our shield to prepare for whatever coming. Oh, this look familiar. Could this be ... Firelink Shrine ? No way, It is really Firelink Shrine!!! Relieve, relax, a little of shock, happy. After all those adventure, we back to the start. ! For me, world's design is the best point of Dark Souls 1. Dark Souls 1 don't have outstanding boss like Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 1 don't have the fluidity of combat like Bloodborne. But whoever make the world's design deserve an VGA for himself. Every stage/map before Anor Londo are all connected with each other via Firelink Shrine, and they all feel so natural, no rushed, no forced. A beautiful and genius design which sadly no other Soulsborne games can keep T.T 6. Soul of Cinder phase 2, three string notes. You can fight humans, monsters, dragons, gods ... But you just can't fight the feel. The first time you hear those notes, the game was about to end. The second time you hear those notes, the franchise was about to end. And after all, you still fighting the same old man who tried so hard to keep his kingdom. RIP 7. Found out about Great Hollow + Ash Lake. I completely miss these areas in my first playthrough. The moment I knew about them via wikidot, I was like ""wtf"", who on earth can found out about that place without a guide ? Illusory wall is sure one of the best thing in Soulsborne. 8. Bring down the hacker named Bloody Crow of Cainhurst. I fought him in NG+. For me, this dude is the hardest non FRC Chalice fight in the whole game. Let me make a comparison. I skipped the DLC in NG. I died against Ludwig 5 times, Living Failures 0, Maria 0, Kos 1, Lawrence 7. In the main game, the boss I have trouble most is Daughter of Cosmos, 4 dead by her . But all those number combined is only 1/4 of the times I was killed by that hacker. He had the health bar of a boss, infinite bullet to spam his gun and Old Hunter Bone, and If the god of rng bless him, he may use his Blood Vial up to 4 times, very very annoy and tedious. He was the only ""boss"" FORCED me to change my setup and playstyle. I removed my favorite Hunter's set, wear the Maria's set, the attire with highest Blood defense, though my hunter is a man. I stock a shitload of molotov, knife and poison knife. I equip all the regen gems on my right hand weapon, then only shoot him with the Blunderbuss + bomb + knife, never use my right hand weapon. It was a 25-30 minutes fight, but finally I take him down for my waifu Eileen. 9. Finish the first FRC Chalice. FRC Chalice is sure one of the best challenge in Bloodborne. Trap everywhere. Enemies nearly always go as a pack, and every single mob in that pack can one shot you. Did I have to mention the boss, more specifically the Hotdog ? It could take you hours to figure it out, some may days, weeks, months. But when you do, I guarantee that was one of the best moment in your gaming life. 10. The Burnt Ivory King entrance. First time I see his entrance, I can't stop myself thinking about Lord of The Rings. Pure badass and epic. ‚Äã My last top 10, and also the hardest top 10 to make, top 10 songs in Soulsborne, which is the very first reason I come to this series. 1. Dark Souls 3 main menu theme 2. Prince Lorian and Lothric's theme 3. Father Gascoigne's theme 4. One Who Craved Souls - unless you already play Demon's Souls, I bet not much of you guys heard this masterpiece. Give that a chance, you won't disappoint, I promise. 5. Gerhman's theme 6. Gundyr's theme 7. Gael's theme 8. Friede's theme 9. Ludwig's theme 10. Cleric Beast's theme, but with his scream :D. The OST itself is already good, but with his scream, It goes to another level. ‚Äã Thanks for reading guys, I just want to share.

With one click, users can now tap into the unlimited power of the cloud to render immediately, hit deadlines and finish faster than ever before.

‚ÄúArtists love the idea of throwing hundreds of computers at a job but dislike the hidden costs and challenges that come with traditional cloud rendering services,‚Äù said Boris Simandoff, Chaos Cloud Director of Engineering at Chaos Group. 
‚ÄúChaos Cloud simplifies this process, reducing it to a single button inside the world‚Äôs most popular renderer. 
With so many artists and designers already using V-Ray, the benefits of the cloud can now be accessed by the widest group possible.‚Äù

Chaos Cloud is backed by five years of R&D and an extensive beta program that saw users render six million frames and over 500,000 jobs over the course of six months. 
Thanks to these tests, artists can now easily render an entire animation in the time it takes to render a single frame, without having to track assets, manage licenses or set up virtual machines. 
Chaos Cloud also removes the need to pack scenes, a laborious process that required artists to manually assemble bitmaps, scripts and plugins every time they wanted to render to the cloud. 
Now, this all happens automatically.

Behind the scenes, smart features are hard at work, removing all the complexity commonly associated with cloud rendering.

SmartSync

With SmartSync technology, data only needs to be uploaded once to the Chaos Cloud. 
After that, only the parts of a scene that change will need to be resynced, keeping upload times to the absolute minimum and ensuring quick iterations as you work.

SmartVault

All data uploaded through Chaos Cloud is stored in its secure SmartVault database for easy recall and additional renders. 
SmartVault keeps track of asset ‚Äúfingerprints,‚Äù so they never need to be uploaded again ‚Äì regardless of how they‚Äôre named, what scene they‚Äôre used in or where they‚Äôre stored locally.

Live View and Remote Control

Since the Chaos Cloud interface is entirely browser-based, artists can also control it from almost any device, including a smartphone. 
With Live View and Remote Control, users can monitor progress, preview images, pause or even cancel renders from anywhere with an internet connection.

While V-Ray rendering is the first offering on the Chaos Cloud, plans are already underway for Corona Renderer and Phoenix FD. 
In the future, Chaos Cloud will also add compatibility for distributed and GPU rendering, promising even faster speeds in the years to come.

‚ÄúChaos Cloud is undeniably the best rendering cloud out there,‚Äù said Gerardo Capote, beta tester and Lead 3D Artist at Embraer Executive Jets. 
‚ÄúWith a friendly user interface and unparalleled reliability, it provides peace of mind to any studio when you render on the cloud.‚Äù

‚ÄúChaos Cloud is perfect for time-critical projects and production deadlines,‚Äù said Ralf Pohl, beta tester and Senior Keyexpert 3D Visualization & Virtual Reality, Siemens Healthcare GmbH. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very user-friendly and we look forward to integrating it in our render pipeline.‚Äù

Pricing and Availability

Chaos Cloud is available now and accessible via a button within V-Ray for 3ds Max, Maya, Rhino, Cinema 4D, Revit, Modo, Houdini [beta] and SketchUp (Next and 3.6 editions).

Unlike some cloud rendering services, pricing for Chaos Cloud is all-inclusive. 
There are no hidden fees or extra charges for licensing, uploads, downloads, storage or starting your render job immediately. 
Customers purchase packages of Chaos Cloud credits, which are available with volume discounts. 
Right now, packages begin at $100 for 100 credits and prices go as low as 55 cents per credit for larger packages. 
Upon sign-up, every user will get 20 free credits. 
Since every scene is different, Chaos Group has also compiled a gallery of samples to help see how render times and credit cost vary by scene.

You've also misinterpreted a lot of what I said, when I said that Xbox games were available on PC if you re-read I was specifically referring to the hardcore crowd. Popularity is going to be a deciding factor in which gets chosen, and PlayStation is a much more popular brand as can easily be seen in sails numbers alone. It is also extremely naive to think Sony won't compete in price when it is what won them the last gen. (on top of Microsofts drm system) The general audience is more inclined to choose Sony over Microsoft, even if the price is slightly higher. Sony is likely to sell at a loss and that will make the console even cheaper. They are also gearing up to compete with Game Pass with PS Now, which offers streaming as well as downloads. Even if Xbox Studios have talent behind them my point is that they are unproven and unlikely to be better than PlayStation games regardless. As well as this patent it is quite obvious to anyone watching that Sony is gearing up to compete, and anybody that doesn't see that are naive. Sony's answer to Game Pass is PS Now which has just added download support, they are getting ready to implement BC, and they are miles and miles ahead when it comes to the games department. The notion that Sony is getting lazy and complacent is stupid, Shawn Layden literally comented on this like a week ago https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/aq43ke/video_shawn_layden_dice_summit_2019_about_the/ Sony is fully aware of the steps Microsoft has taken and it its blatantly obvious that they have been setting up the infrastructure to compete","unknown","","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","","0","0","","0.0","","0.0","","","","0","https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/am1i53/sony_patents_a_new_system_of_backward/ehj56ec/#5320f5e24.ehj56ec","0","0","","","0","238343844166","","false","","","","","","reply","0","","1424469000","0","","","","0","0","0","","","0","0","false","2019-03-01T04:20:45.091+0000","","0.0","4971"

Is it worth beating the PS2 version now and playing Kiwami 2 later if/when it comes to PC? As for the PS3 games, only 4 and 5 are available on PSNow. 3 isn't though. How much of a problem is it going straight from 2 to 4 and playing 3 when it's available on PSNow/PC?

This is yet another topic about game dev.

Before you start reading, a bit of context (correct me if I'm wrong): three weeks ago, ThePile ""appeared"" in the development part of the game and hyped a few people to continue the development of the game (see http://darkspace.net/index.htm'module=forums.php&page=/viewtopic.php&topic=54919&forum=285) , including me.

Since then, the Discord channel is pretty active, mostly in the dev section and that makes me happy to see people still care about this game. 
I even played it a few hours these last couple of days.

All of that is great but in order to move on, we actually need to know what to do. 
Maybe some of you know and it's somewhere in their head, but since it doesn't seem to be written somewhere, for me (and probably others), it doesn't exist.

I think the point of open sourcing the game is to try to get a bit more contributors and players if possible. 
Or at least make the game more enjoyable for those who play from time to time, or daily.

I see a lot of talk on Discord about features or adjustments, for example: Ships balance. 
Players talk about it from time to time but if there is something I learned on my side: talking about huge features or huge ""game logic change"" like this one on a live chat is often not the right solution: it's hard for people to remember what have been said a few days ago and they won't be able to easily find back what was said. 
What I mean by that is: we may be better using the forums for such topics. 
Do not hesitate to create a topic to request comments from other players about what you have in mind (you could tag them [RFC], ""request for comments"" for example).

The other topic I ""often"" see is the on-boarding of new players and the UI that might be a little too complex.

I didn't see much talk about how we could improve it. 
This talk might also be better in a topic, at least to ask players opinions and from there, take actions (or not).

Other than that, there are a few bug fixes to do and some ground work with the resourcer, which I'll probably try do this week if nothing else pops up.

All in all, if you have ideas, do not hesitate to express them, create topics about it so people can tell their opinions. 
Some features will take months to be decided, others a few hours. 
But that's how it works and at least we will have somewhere to move forward to, which IMHO, is not the case for now.

And I encourage you to comment on this post if you disagree about something, if I said something wrong or if I'm a complete moron.

PS: now that the game is open source, it's (partially) up to the community to decide where the game goes. 
And you are the community. 
Every idea or opinion matters

PS2: I didn't talk much about bugs: if you see some, reporting in the dev channel on Discord or through a topic is fine for me. 
And if it's not a bug, maybe it's a game logic problem.

inb4 ""FIX KLUTH AI SPAWNZSS"" (spoiler alert: for me there are no bugs)

EDIT: for suggestions, you can make a topic here http://darkspace.net/index.htm'module=forums.php&page=/viewforum.php'forum=36&25365 but please search for an existing topic and bump it if needed

Posted: 2018-02-03 15:17 i would have to agree with the what to do part. 
i myself (having no experiance in development of any game) have wanted to get into the development of a game. 
when i read darkspace went to open source i was glad that i could have my chance. 
tho i have no idea where to start even if its a rough guide someone could post would be helpful. 
could anyone be willing to help get me there? 
thanks in advance love this game hope to see it continue.

p.s. time is not an issue for me when im not working im always doing a project and id like this to be a project i can work on. 
plus i can usually learn anything fairly quickly.

Posted: 2018-02-07 08:31 honestly what killed it for me was taking away elite npc's and most of the npc population. the game is low population player base as it is and that just made it boring.

bring back npc populations with elite npcs and make the maps bigger!!!

i miss the old map....

Posted: 2018-02-07 14:12 The beta server is updated before the production servers, to test features and fix bugs. 
The few last releases didn't get tested on the beta server but this was a bug and we did not want that to happen. 
It is now fixed.

As for the npc population you're talking about I'm not sure I've been around long enough to know what that is :/

_________________

Posted: 2018-02-07 16:36 ther used to be NPC dreads, stations and all other class of ships even interdictors that spawned in the perspective factions home system.... this was a viable way to lvl up combat and actualy do combat instead of chasing down recon and troop carriers like now. 
i think this is a important feature that should be returned to the game considering the player base is super low. 
gives newer players an incentive to keep playing and allows them to rank up faster.

whoever is involved in the development of this game should take my advice...

stop making changes to game mechanics that already work and focus on making the game more populated. 
i don't know if its a server issue not being able to handle the load, but i feel populating the game fixing a few bugs and focusing on updating the website are more important to the survival of the game. 
i want to see new players coming in and them actualy having something do do other than ""try"" to build a planet. 
or ""try"" to bomb a planet. 
i do agree that ecm and eccm need some adjustments but i don't think messing with the cloak is an effective way of doing so. 
ICC ships stacking ecm is just as effective and as a cloak if not more so. 
they need stacking penalties and the ability to switch out more of the auxiliary modules with more variety.

on another note

I'm not happy with the timer on these cloaks either. 
i know trying to do it with energy vs time was tried and failed but 90 seconds is hardly enough time to maneuver and stay undetected. the element of surprise is halved from this change. 
i understand that perma cloaks are a pain in the arse as a ugto player but i think you guys went about it all wrong. 
you need to fix the modules that help detect the cloak, like beacons and eccm instead of hating on k'luth and nerfing their power and in turn driving away all the k'luth players. 
you guys aren't bringing the game back to life your adjusting game mechanics to fit your own personal needs.

food for thought.................

maybe try and get the game added on steam!?!?

Posted: 2018-02-07 16:49 Things that are anoying and made me and some friends stopped playing are the jump drive that takes to long to charge and makes the game very slow. 
Players rank up to play with dreads and stations and some with cruisers, imagine if a fight is 2 sistems away how long will make to get there ?? Well i get bored to travel 10 minutes foa 1 mi ute fight. 
The second thing that i dont like is that torpedos range is very , very low. 
It used to be a longer range with less damage and it really made the game more imterested. 
Oh and the last one is planet dences ....planets are useless, dictors on them aint working , bombing and killing a planet is for any newb and is very easy. 
No pd like it used to be. 
So in my opinion the game should get better not worse. 
Trust me if this changes take place you will see alot of people back. 
Till then ill play Ps4 games! 
Have a good day !

Not sure how feasible that would be though. 
For instance rearranging the target window from the lower right hand corner to somewhere more immediately visible is one thing I might suggest as a specific. 
It gets rather difficult to see when there is a lot going on in the game.

yes!!!! these are things that need to be fixed. 
maybe have short rang and long range torpedoe variants for playstyle. 
and dictors not working.... lots of things that are broken and every one is interested in changing snap that already works.

seems like the current people developing are just using a dead game to mess around with a toy with... not thinking about the big picture... this game could be great. 
but no one realy has the intention of making it so.

i sence sarcasm in a effort to dismiss a truly good idea. 
this wouldn't hurt the game anymore than its hurting. 
you guys are killing me with your fiddle faddle bull snap..

get a select few people to be developers get rid of gameCQ fly under a new banner close the open dev and submit it to steam.

i don't know jack snap about code but i know how game mechanics affect game play on a bigger scale. 
ive seen many game come and go...

this is all i will say cuz it feel like there already are a select few doing the dev and they don't seem interested in making any actual fixes to the game. 
they just want to tweak the stats and play around with it.

Posted: 2018-02-08 07:06 Hello to all,

Thanks for the feedback.

I edited my first message so you know where to put the suggestions. 
I won't take a position for or against what you say because I don't have the required knowledge of the game, the players do. 
But having a thread PER suggestion will help the discussion, instead of having multiple subjects into one huge messed up thread.

Also, please note something: For some time now, the development of the game (if any) has been done on people own free time. 
By free time, I mean ""after work hours"", or ""during rainy weekends"", or ""whenever the dev felt like s.he wanted to do something"".

Hence, it's quite useless to blame ""devs"" for not making the game better. 
Instead, be supportive! 
Anyone can now contribute and if there is something you don't like, feel free to do it yourself, we would be very glad

Posted: 2018-02-10 00:35 the distance required for MIRV bombs to be dropable could be adjusted from the 100 gu it is now to something more reasonable like 25 or 30 gu, i just find that being a close orbit bombing specialist is harder than it needs to be b/c the moment the distence drops under 100 gu the bombs won't fire. 
thank you for all your hard work.

peace out

But skimming over some of the other posts on this subreddit, I'm seeing that I may have compatibility issues playing certain games with my current PC controller (a wired 3rd party 360 controller). Is there a list somewhere of games that MUST have a Ps4 controller to be playable? First and foremost I want to play through Bloodbourne, so if nothing else, if someone can confirm that *that* game works fine with a 360 controller, I'd appreciate it.

Rep. Nelda Speaks and Sen. Mark Johnson are sponsoring HB 1531 . 
It would allow anybody who has ever served as a judge, even by appointment to serve out a term vacancy, to run up to five years after the appointment for any political office as ""judge"" Having the title in front of your name is presumed of incalculable political value, particularly in a judicial race where no other candidate carries the title.

Why this bill? 
Why now?

Johnson says this bill has no particular beneficiary, it's just good government that he agreed to co-sponsor. 
He cites his own father, a former Supreme Court justice. 
He preferred to be known as Justice Jim when he ran for governor. 
He said I was the first to suggest to him that this bill was backed by Doyle Webb, the state Republican Party chair, who might have a personal interest. 
A couple of others had suggested to me that was the case.

Webb's wife, Barbara Webb , got to serve a year in 2018 as a circuit judge in Saline County until a vacancy could be filled thanks to by Gov. Asa Hutchinson. 
She's moved on for now to a $102,000 job as administrative law judge at the Workers Compensation Commission. 
Circuit judges make $163,000.

A couple of judgeships are on the ballot in the Webbs' home of Saline County next year. 
The thinking is that Barbara Webb will be a candidate for one of them. 
This bill, it so happens, would allow her, on the strength of a year as a judge in 2018, to run as a ""judge"" should she make a race.

Reliable sources say Webb (Doyle) has been lobbying for the legislation. 
He's reportedly saying it would contribute to his agenda to put more conservatives (meaning Republicans) on the bench. 
Judgeships are nominally non-partisan. 
Note that the bill changes a law that applied only to judicial office to allow the title in any race.

Judges Grisham Phillips and Gary Arnold are retiring, so their Saline seats are wide open in 2020. 
At least four other names are circulating as potential candidates. 
Things could get interesting if Webb runs a contested race. 
Her record for her year in office will be an issue. 
Better still is a report that as a young law student in the 1980s she demonstrated Democratic tendencies in some public activities then. 
In Republican Arkansas today, that's almost akin to a Virginia Democrat turning up in blackface in a yearbook photo.

I""ve sent questions to both Barbara and Doyle Webb about the legislation. 
No response so far.

The bill's about someone. 
Just as another bill that makes a change in the legislation that essentially forces judicial retirements by Rep. David Hillman (R-Almyra) undoubtedly has someone in mind. 
He hasn't returned my messages either. 
As it stands, ou turn 70 during a term you forfeit retirement if you run again. 
Hillman's bill would allow someone to retain retirement as long as they hadn't turned 70 ON THE DAY THEY WERE ELECTED, meaning in the last year of a term. 
This would have the effect of protecting retirement benefits and allow continued work up to almost 76 for, say, a circuit judge who turned 70 in the final year of a six-year term. 
The legislature has resisted ‚Äî and the Supreme Court has rejected legal challenges to ‚Äî changes in the retirement rule.

PS: Now comes another whisper: The plan is to run Barbara Webb for Supreme Court is how this version goes.
