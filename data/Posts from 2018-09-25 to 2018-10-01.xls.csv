178652051781,10/1/2018,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/178652051781,"Capcom brought Resident Evil 7 to Nintendo Switch in Japan as a streaming-only game. This seems to have been an experiment of sorts, as the Japanese publisher is now apparently considering bringing some of its other games to the Switch in cloud form in Japan. A spokesperson for the company told the Wall Street Journal that Capcom will make announcements about other cloud games for Switch after it gets a look at the numbers and other metrics for Resident Evil 7.

Sources told WSJ that Capcom is already looking at “other titles” to bring to Japan as streaming-only games. However, it’s not clear what these other games are or when they might be released. Presumably they will be ports, just like Resident Evil 7, but this is not confirmed.

One of the benefits of streaming games from the cloud instead of playing them locally is that it allows the Switch, which is underpowered compared to PS4 and Xbox One, to play more graphically and technically demanding games. However, as with other streaming services like PlayStation Now, the quality of your experience will depend on the strength and reliability of your internet connection.

For Resident Evil 7 on Switch, another matter is that Capcom effectively only rents you the game. For that game, Capcom charged about $18 for 180 days of play. It remains to be seen if the same pricing structure would be implemented for future releases.

Whatever the case, many are predicting that streaming is going to become increasingly popular in the coming years. Electronic Arts recently acquired a streaming company to help with its own streaming ambitions, while Xbox has already confirmed it is working on a game-streaming service that has not yet been announced. Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Microsoft’s streaming service will offer “console-quality” gaming on “any device.” And of course, Sony already has its own streaming service in PlayStation Now.

Take-Two Strauss Zelnick said recently that he believes game-streaming will truly take off in the next 1-3 years.

From the beginning, until now, there are still issues with the PC client that need addressing badly. I'm actually pretty certain that since the launch of this service, the PC client has never received a single update. 1. The infamous ""white screen"". The client goes white when it has been idle too long, or after players have been in-game too long, and then it needs a restart. 2. The infinite restart loop. This is usually fixed by turning off graphic acceleration, but why should we have to? 3. The awful layout. The layout on PS4 is amazing; you can even search, and there are some other options available. Why does the PC version look and subsequently act so atrociously? I swear, I thought Origin and early uPlay were terrible clients. PSNow is by far the worst PC client of the lot. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big advocate for the service as I think it's a great idea. However, it's an idea that Sony need to keep refining and perfecting. If you're allowing it on PC, at least show the PC component some TLC. ​ /endrant",,Inmate4815162342,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

178640657845,10/1/2018,http://engadget-in-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/178640657845,"Project Stream promises to deliver the holy grail to video game fans around the globe – the ability to play the latest AAA games on any laptop or PC via a stable, no-lag streaming service. Google is preparing to publicly test Project Stream with a “limited number of participants” on October 5th, letting them play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey for free in the Chrome browser. That’s the latest game in the Assassin’s Creed series, and it’s a massive open-world adventure packed with 4K-capable graphics.

In a demo video, Google shows Assassin’s Creed Odyssey streaming at 1080p and 60fps.





If all goes to plan, the game should work on any laptop or PC, regardless of how recently you’ve updated the graphics card. However, Google recommends a home internet connection of at least 25 megabits per second. For anyone interested in playing the new Assassin’s Creed on the day it comes out, for free, in the Chrome browser, there’s an application right here.

Google developers said the beta test is meant to push the limits of Project Stream. AAA video games are far more complicated to stream than a movie or TV show, offering dense worlds of animation and input-sensitive information.

“The idea of streaming such graphically-rich content that requires near-instant interaction between the game controller and the graphics on the screen poses a number of challenges,” developers wrote. “When streaming TV or movies, consumers are comfortable with a few seconds of buffering at the start, but streaming high-quality games requires latency measured in milliseconds, with no graphic degradation.”

Rumors have been flying for months about a potential Google-branded streaming service. Initial reports said any such service would link up to Chromecast, allowing users to play AAA games on their TVs without modern consoles. There’s also buzz about Google adding Bluetooth capabilities to the next version of Chromecast, opening up the door to connected gamepads.

Google isn’t alone in the streaming-game space. Sony has PlayStation Now, but it hasn’t exactly solved the lag issue yet, while companies like OnLive have burst onto the scene with big streaming promises only to quietly implode soon after. One of the latest companies to enter the scene is LiquidSky, which has been fairly silent since officially launching in March 2017. Meanwhile, Microsoft is working on a game-streaming service for the next Xbox generation.

Google just announced “Project Stream,” a “technical test” of a service designed to stream AAA video games à la Playstation Now and GeForce Now. We’ve heard rumors of a “Project Yeti” gaming service for some time now, and this looks to be the first sign of a real “Google Gaming” product.

The Project Stream test will involve streaming Ubisoft's Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to desktop-class Chrome browsers, which means it will work on Windows, macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS. Google’s blog post says that a “limited number of participants” will be able to try the game for free starting October 5. A 25Mbps Internet connection is “recommended” for the service, and you’ll need accounts with Google and Ubisoft. For controls, you have options of a keyboard and mouse or a USB (not Bluetooth) game controller. Google says a recent Xbox or Playstation controller will work fine. Provided you are 17 years or older and live in the US, you can sign up at projectstream.google.com.

Game-streaming services are still in their infancy, but the idea applies the standard “cloud computing” thinking to video games. Rather than have players buy and maintain their own expensive gaming hardware, game streaming offloads that compute work to the cloud and streams down only what you need (a video feed) over the Internet. When done correctly, the services allow for high-fidelity games on minimal hardware.

Playstation Now does not add XInput support to any DualShock controller. What it does do is install official DualShock 3 drivers to make that controller officially support DirectInput correctly. To be more accurate, the only driver Playstation Now installs is ""Wireless controller for PLAYSTATION(R)3 Driver Package"", with the description being ""Enables the access of PLAYSTATION(R)3 wireless controllers"", located in C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\sixaxis.inf_amd64_ef8eb017ea26cd93\ on 64-bit Windows. This driver is only applied for devices with the HWID: 054C:0268 (the DS3 controller). The HWIDs of the DS4 controller is not covered (see [this PCGW section](https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Controller:DualShock_4#Technical_information) for what HWIDs the models of that controller covers). No other drivers from Sony is installed during the installation. That driver allows DualShock 3 controllers to function in pure DirectInput mode, as evidenced by the note between step 3 and 4 in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/5qp7va/configuration_how_to_use_dualshock_3_on_windows/). Another consequence of that driver is that it allows Steam (and subsequently users) to [enable DualShock 3 configuration support](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/1671283521940805450) for the Steam Input wrapper layer. Finally, the Steam Input wrapper layer then converts the DirectInput signals it detects from the controller into the appropriate XInput signals it send further to games that uses XInput. DualShock 4 already have native DirectInput support (as well as what some calls ""DS4HID"", its custom HID interface) from the generic drivers that gets installed when the controller is connected to the system. To get XInput support, Playstation configuration support needs to be enabled in Steam as well. So basically: * Neither controller supports XInput natively, regardless of Playstation Now. * Both controllers require Steam Input's wrapper to be active so that said wrapper can emulate XInput signals (or another third-party DirectInput-to-XInput compatibility layer). I am basing this all on my extensive testing using DualShock 4 controllers for PCGamingWiki related articles, my research into the Steam Input feature of Steam, as well as my testing and research into what driver(s), exactly, Playstation Now installs.",,Aemony,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Google and publisher Ubisoft announced Monday that select participants will be able to stream “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” for free when it launches on Friday, as a way to test something Google is calling ""Project Stream."" Anyone in the United States can sign up for one of the limited spots on Google’s Project Stream site right now. Those who get in can play the game through their Chrome browser until the testing period ends in mid-January. Given that “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” reportedly has more than 100 hours of content in it, that should give testers plenty of time to see the game to completion. Ideally, Project Stream will allow users to play “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” without needing an expensive piece of hardware, like a PlayStation, Xbox or gaming PC. Players will essentially stream a video of themselves playing the game, similar to how the PlayStation Now service works on PS4. Google included footage of the game purportedly being played through Project Stream in its announcement. Of course, for the game to consistently look that good and run that well over a stream, the player’s internet will need to hold up. Google recommends download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second. That would disqualify around 24 million Americans, or almost 8 percent of the population, according to the FCC’s findings in 2016 . Game streaming could also be an expensive proposition for Americans who do have access to fast internet. Hundreds of ISPs around the country impose monthly data caps on customers. Meanwhile, the federal government reversed net neutrality protections earlier this year. Aside from visual fidelity and performance, the primary concern with game streaming going forward is latency. If a player presses a button and their character on-screen does not respond until half a second later, the player will notice. Responsiveness is not an issue when streaming music or even high definition video, but nobody has presented an ironclad solution for video games, yet. Google will stream the new 'Assassin's Creed' game through Chrome. Game enthusiasts and industry personnel walk past a 'Assassin's Creed Odyssey' advertisemtn during the Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 at the Los Angeles Convention Center on June 12, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. Photo: Christian Petersen/Getty Images Google acknowledged that in its announcement, emphasizing that Project Stream will hopefully help the company figure out how to properly stream games. “We’re inspired by the game creators who spend years crafting these amazing worlds, adventures and experiences, and we’re building technology that we hope will support and empower that creativity,” product manager Catherino Hsiao wrote. Rumors have indicated Google would dip its toes into the gaming market via game streaming for months. The project, reportedly codenamed Yeti, may or may not eventually tie into a piece of dedicated gaming hardware manufactured by Google, according to a Kotaku report from June.",,Alex Perry,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,"Google, Ubisoft Partner For 'Assassin's Creed Odyssey' Chrome Stream Test",,,

While I was not expecting to be able to download PS3 games and play them on my PS4, I did expect to be treated with at least some desirable downloadable PS2 and PS4 titles. Frankly, the selection of downloadable titles was extremely limited, and they simply were not very appealing. Not to mention, you cannot keep the games once your PlayStation Now subscription expires. Moreover, while researching the downloadable game feature, I found that the PlayStation Now service required its users to check in online periodically to verify their DRM user licenses. While I understand that this online check-in feature has been implemented to prevent users from abusing the PlayStation Now service, I can also imagine how much of a hardship this feature presents for subscribers who have military duties overseas, or for subscribers who are unable to obtain a constant Internet connection. I understand that this new feature has only been out for a little more than a week, and I am sure that Sony will expand their downloadable PlayStation Now game library in the coming months. With that being said, I cannot recommend subscribing to the service as it stands at this time.

Has anyone here tried it out? To me, it looks like this could possibly be the future of gaming.Streaming a game in 4K hosted on dedicated servers meaning no game downloading required and all games saves and purchases are saved on the cloud. You can even purchase the latest games through steam and Uplay as they are supported. What are your thoughts on this? Could this one day do away with console and PC gaming do you think? This box is extremely powerful for such a little device and compared to a high end gaming PC, ps4 pro or Xbox one X it's dirt cheap! This will be a long post I have given my opinions on this on here before, but I'm not a fan of streaming gameplay. This whole ""Netflix of Video Games"" stuff is a load of nonsense. Watching tv on a stream and gaming on a stream are very different things. I recently tried PSNow, and although it was ok, it was well off being at the point where I would ever want it to be my main way to play games. The only thing streaming gameplay has that is better than what we are doing now is that it's instant that is literally all I can think of that is better. But people don't actually seem to mind that they have to download their games, so even this isn't anything special. Look at the reaction to Sony announcing that games on PSNow can be downloaded to your PS4, people are now much more interested in PSNow for this reason alone. Here are the major issues I have with it. It requires an almost perfect internet connection. Ok, you can get away with playing it on a decent connection, it doesn't need to be perfect to play on it, but if you want perfect gameplay streaming, then you need a perfect connection and it's something nobody has. For me, nothing but perfection is going to be enough. If I am going to be moving away from the way I am playing now, then you need to make my experience better or at least as good. If I'm suffering lag or latency issues at any point, then what is the point? How can that ever be acceptable? It may be fine for the casual gamer that is going to play the odd 10 minutes here and there, but for somebody like me that has many gaming sessions, it's just not good enough. Video quality, it looks poor on a stream. Just because it says HD or 4K, that doesn't mean it looks good. Every so often I am seeing a drop in quality and things get blocky. That has been a problem with videos or streaming online for as long as the internet has been around. Compression is a major problem, why would I choose crappy looking compressed video quality over the crisp clear image I have now? Quite simply, I'm not going to accept it, it's a deal breaker. I don't buy a nice monitor for average quality picture. We don't own the games. Geforce Now is better in this case because you can play your Steam and Uplay games, but how long will they have your game available for you to play? We are talking about every game here, it's highly likely they will remove your game at some point or won't ever have your game available to play anyway. Like I if it's not better than what I already have, then why would I bother with it? Mods. As a PC gamer, I love mods, they are great fun and have improved many games over the years and actually even fixed many issues that exist in games. Mods wouldn't be possible for a streaming service. Having that taken away would be another deal breaker for me. They like to make out that streaming is the future, but it's not a better future, not even close to it. It's worse, and I can't see how they could possibly fix the issues I have pointed out above. All good points. I wasn't trying to say the shield is the future, btw, just that it might be a hint of what is to come at some point in the future. At some point in the future I would assume issues with slow broadband speeds and latency will be a thing of the past as technology progresses. For me, personally, as a casual gamer I like the idea of a game being available instantly to play rather than having to wait for it to download. I understand totally what you're getting at in regards to ownership of the game. If you have bought it you should always be able to access it. With Steam as it is currently, I can purchase a game and download it to my PC to play it, but this Nvidia shield device allows you to stream your game in another room or even at your friends house etc without having to lug your massive PC around. I think that's pretty cool.",,bottleofbest,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Anyone gamed with the Nvidia shield?,,,

Of course, players are expected to have a high-speed internet connection to guarantee steady gameplay and the PlayStation 4 would even test your internet connection if its sufficient enough to stream a game.

One game ? All games + locking third party locking saves ? That’s really questionnable. If you actually check the “drama” that occured, people didn’t care much about crossplay, they wanted their saves. And their reponse is absotely cocky and ignoring what players said. thatdudetony: What would make you think nobody would purchase a ps5? People care about GAMES, and Sony has delivered them in spades this generation, and they have plenty of very promising upcoming games? Ok so besides their few first party that arguably more interesting than Xbox’s first party(I guess taste is a thing here, I’m not into Uncharted or God Of War much, I like them, not crazy about them, could live without playing those, but samely I got little interest in Forza, Halo and Gears of War) , most others exclusive are likely to drop(Yakuza franchise, Kingdom Hearts, FF, NieR…). The reason Sony got that many exclusives on PS4, again, is because of Microsoft screwing themselves up. Devs didn’t want to bother. thatdudetony: Microsoft going cross plat with PC on all their games is even a less incentive to purchase an Xbox. Why buy an external piece of hardware, when I can play all their games on my rig that’s much more powerful and intuitive? You and I and other PC gamers. Not everyone. Yet…I refuse to use Microsoft’s store on my PC. I agree that putting that many of their game on “Xbox play anywhere” is a mistake. And Sony is starting to approach something similar with PSNow, not exactly the same, but…could stop some people to bother getting a system. My point is right now, Sony has won this gen but ends it with on a quite negative note, while Microsoft is too late for this gen, but they’ll end it having people thinking “heh they did alright in the end, we got Nier:Automata, we’re getting KH3, we’re getting all those Final Fantasy games”. We’ll really see what they reveal as their next machine, but Microsoft being at an indeed all time low is a good thing for next gen : they have to shine or they won’t rise again. Look at the previous gen : PS3 was getting beaten, Sony was fighting like Rocky against Ivan Drago, and they ended the gen on a rather positive note in the end. I think, scenario wise, it’d be good that Sony takes a good slapping in the face, at least at first, next gen, so that they become more humble again and more open minded. But who knows ? They might come right away “ok guys, with PS5, we’re giving you crossplay, our servers are better than ever, we got this and that, we heard you and what you asked, here it goes” and they’d beat Microsoft again absolutely easily, fine. I want a good “fight”, if there’s no challenge, you got no reason to make efforts to please the community, you’re number one ! Why bother ? I love Sony and Nintendo, but I’m glad Wii U pushed Nintendo to make some efforts and get games they wouldn’t have asked to have on their systems before. JamieJGJ: But for everyone that want quality singleplayer games PS5 is the system to have. We have to see. Looking at this gen the point is true, I absolutely love the Yakuza franchise so there was no way I wouldn’t get a PS4, but they are starting to come to PC now mmmh. NieR:Automata made it out of PS4/PC to also go Xbox, Kingdom Hearts comes to Xbox. I think Xbox could prevent some third party exclusives to happen, if they do good, which wasn’t the case this generation obviously. JamieJGJ: I will be going for a PS5 when it comes out. Just because of the JRPG’s (Persona, Tales of), God of War and Spider-man exclusive games Persona is a good point(I still enjoy Shin Megami Tensei slightly more somehow, including the TRPGs Devil Survivor 1 and 2, had a lot of fun on these, but TRPG is one of my fav genre, reminds me I gotta get into Valkyria Chronicles 4 asap), but the way Sega(and thus Atlus) is right now, I’m waiting. I mean, they clearly stated they want to release more things to PC, so I wanna see how it goes, if they release like, I don’t know, Yakuza 7 or Persona 6(unlikely to happen but big convincing games that would make people choose a platform possibly, at least for me) to PS5 and say they’ll release it to PC next year, not sure I can wait that long to play it on my prefered platform and I might go PS5. If it’s simultaneous, sweet I’m getting it on PC.",,Lightning-22274,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,Phil Spencer’s bombshell announcement,,,

I know that characters from the first game are in the second, but that's about it. ====================::==================== User Info: caboose84 caboose84 12 hours ago #9 Well, the point of most prequels seems to be fan service, they typically expect you to have at least an understanding of who the characters are, and the events of the previous games/sequels. I don’t think I’ve ever seen/played a prequel that worked particularly well as a stand-alone experience, or at least as an entry-point to a series. God of War: Ascension for example would be a terrible game to start the series with, because it talks about events that are uncovered/learned of in the first GoW, and expects you to know who Kratos is, how he became the Ghost of Sparta, who Ares/Zeus are, etc. My point is, you could only benefit from playing through Red Dead Redemption before playing the 2nd, even if it is a prequel, because like virtually every prequel in existence, it expects you to know who some of these characters are, and it will no doubt reference or foreshadow events that are going to happen in the first. Plus, like others have said in previous topics about this, if you ever intend on going back and playing the original, it’ll only feel that much more dated and clunky in comparison to this one. You can play it on the PS3, 360, XONE through backwards compatibility, or PS4 through PSNow, and it’s like $15-$20 for the GotY Edition with all of the DLC, so it’s not like it’s a hard game to get ahold of and play. I just don’t see why you wouldn’t wanna play it before playing the 2nd game.

From Pitfall through to Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, we got our fix through platformers or point-and-click adventure games, but then 1996’s Tomb Raider melded the two together and perfected the action-adventure game - and it’s only grown in popularity since. The PC boasts some true classics of the genre, from classic tomb raiding to games with enough exploration to fill an entire sandbox - not the one in your backyard - so we’ve put together a list of the best action-adventure around. This includes some of the finest games ever made on PC, action-adventure or otherwise, including several titles that changed the entire gaming industry. There’s no Uncharted here, as emulation or PlayStation Now doesn’t count, but we’d take any one of these games over Sony’s series. Here’s the definitive list of the best action-adventures on PC.

It reaffirms that this idea downloading games via subscription is a hit. (Sony does lead they only follow whats successful and sustainable) after being told for month that it was a stupid model by outsiders. Xbox One X owners (aka the device built and marketed for more hardcore enthusiast) will be the best place to play the game. No PC support means more attention being focused on the X due to it being the strongest platform the game will be available on. It's going to look marvelous. Not sure why you aren't grasping this. A lot of crow is going to have to be eaten after today. So basically you wanted reassurance that you're not wasting your money on Game Pass and just received that now that PSNow, which is still a heavily overpriced service IMO, allows you to download some games? Could you not just subscribe, not care about what some people think, and be happy that MS gave you the option for it? They're not exactly looking to take it down anytime soon, they've already considered the service a great success. And for RDR2, again, why is it good news to anyone who isn't a massive fanboy for a specific console or just consoles in general that PC won't get a multi-platform game? You're still getting the game on your platform of choice regardless, so it's really just bad news for PC players hoping to play RDR2 for themselves. It's awesome you'll enjoy the game, and it's awesome it'll look nice on all consoles it's available on, but how is it at all good news that one specific platform isn't getting one specific game? That's what I'm not grasping is why you act like it's something to get hyped about.",,flame030191,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

178644895270,10/1/2018,http://kylieperrine.tumblr.com/post/178644895270,"Testers of Project Stream will be able to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on Oct. 5.

Thanks to services like NVIDIA GeForce Now and PlayStation Now, the gaming industry has been experimenting a lot with the act of streaming video games over an internet connection rather than running them locally on a console or PC. Now, the latest company to dip its toes in the streaming games market is Google.



On Monday, October 1, Google formally announced Project Stream — a new technology from the company that is designed to stream AAA video games to your computer using just an internet connection and web browser.

Per Google’s announcement post:

The technology and creativity behind these AAA video games is extraordinary—from incredible detail and life-like movement of the characters’ skin, clothing, and hair, to the massive scale of the world in which the game unfolds, down to every last blade of grass. Every pixel is powered by an array of real-time rendering technology, artistry, visual effects, animation, simulation, physics and dynamics. We’re inspired by the game creators who spend years crafting these amazing worlds, adventures and experiences, and we’re building technology that we hope will support and empower that creativity.

To kickstart Project Stream, Google’s looking for people in the U.S. to test drive the service with the opportunity to play Assassin’s Creed Oddysey for free starting October 5 and going through mid-January. All you need is an internet connection of 25Mbs or higher and a desktop or laptop with Google Chrome.

What’s the ultimate goal of Project Stream? While Google’s yet to say one way or another, it’s very possible that this will tie into reports from earlier this year of Google working on its own gaming console called “Yeti.” We already know that Yeti will have a focus on cloud-based streaming, so it only seems logical that Project Stream is our first introduction to that.

Google’s holding an event on October 9 to unveil the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, and should the company take some time to go into further detail about Project Stream and/or Yeti, we’ll be sure to let you know.

I like how Sony still managed to sneaky in bits about it making ""business sense"" in the wording ====================::==================== Quote: : So your goal to not split a playerbase.... is to split a player base. Just brilliant. The applicability of cross play will depend on the game in question and as gears of war showed us needs to be tested instead of people blindly making assumptions. The main issue consoles are facing is pc is growing very quickly and is not slowing down (it has in fact surpassed the entire console market from what I understand). Microsoft is aware of this and thus have been positioning themselves to take advantage of it. Sony has not revealed what there plans are beyond maybe psnow, so time will tell how they intend to continue playstation in the future. Except that everyone I know that has a PC pirates their games and doesnt spend a single penny on software. Everybody I know that has a console actually pays for their software. So, PC may have outgrown consoles, but is it really financially viable for the companies producing content for it? That begs the question, how long will publishers keep supporting PC?",,Petra_Kalbrain,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,F,,,,PS4 Cross Play Beta,,,

RAAAWWWRRR posted... wildstrike1516 posted... RDR2 developer confirm game will not come to PC making the X THE place to play that game for the best graphical experience. WHAT A WEEK!!!!!!!!! Wait really? I wasn't going nuts. Apparently a dev said this in a stream related to the game and it was translated poorly. https://gamingbolt.com/red-dead-redemption-2-absolutely-not-coming-to-pc-rockstar-says R* did something similar with GTA5. Said they had no plans to release a PC version. 18 months later... They stand to lose a lot of money ignoring that market. It’ll come. Yeah I recall shortly before GTAV’s release them saying something like they’re dedicated to supporting the game that they’re releasing and aren’t looking into other platforms, seemingly knocking the idea of 8th gen console and PC release. Not long after release did rumors from noteworthy companies like Intel suggest it was releasing after all before R* finally confirmed it themselves. That same thing could happen here. We’ve seen developers change their plans and counteract their promises before, From Software did it twice by saying Dark Souls and then later Dark Souls 2 would never have DLC. Then again, maybe they are going to stick to their guns and just keep it console exclusive. Who knows, and who cares? Well, aside from wildstrike, apparently, as he seems excited that a large market is getting locked out of a big game for no good reason.... I listed off things xbox fans have to be excited about but you are just lying and making assumption out of what I said. What came across is that you listed reasons you’re excited. How is it exciting for an Xbox fan that PSNow lets you download PS2 and PS4 games to a PS4 console? How is it exciting to literally anyone at all besides the most hardcore of Xbox fanboys that a multi-platform game isn’t going to PC?",,flame030191,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Nope, gamepass has new AAA games, all games downloadable, no online checks, full copies of free games to download and keep....and his daughter is pretty relieved that she can change her username from ""Barbiegirl2573"" unlike on PS4. It has good not so new games while Gamepass has mostly really old games and crappy new games. I'm pretty sure those kids will prefer to play good not-so-new games than shit new games and super old games like on Gamepass .

Who cares how a person manages to play a game on another system? In the end the person playing it through PSNow or any other streaming means is playing it without a PS4 on their home. That you have to now add a legal requirement to somehow claim ownage and keep PC exclusives valid says a lot about how weak your subjective definition is. This is what happens when you make an arbitrary definition as to what an exclusive means and pretend there is some kind of universal rule behind it. Fine, consider them not exclusives, I'll keep consider them as exclusives because your definition is completely subjective and arbitrary and makes the concept of exclusive obsolete. Lmao, so funny seeing you projecting your insecurity on me. And no, I have outlined many reasons why your desperate argument about an individual streaming to you and that too a hypothetical scenario not a real one is flawed to begin with. No one moved the goal posts apart from cows that they even have to equate 2 completely different things, hence your repeated attempts at 'technicalities doesn't matter' goal post move. No matter what mental gymnastics you do, the mentioned games are no longer exclusives and I don't need a PS4 to play those games. And gladly take off the games from PC exclusives list when the reverse ever happens, so far it didn't. Even then, no matter how you slice it PC will still come out on top and still objectively be a better platform. I understand the desperation because cows bread and butter are max 4-5 'one and done' games and hence their desire to held on to it via any means necessary. Again, don't need a PS4. :D Ciao! But it has been done. Just because you don't know about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Here: https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/20/play-pc-games-on-your-ps3-with-streammygame/, now PC has no exclusives anymore lol. Yeah, Linux enabled PS3 which doesn't exist after the update connected via LAN to 'PC', LMAO. Again goes back to that desperate attempt of putting individual against a corporate provided service where you do need to pay for the base system. Go ahead and play 'all PC games' by first buying the 'PC' and the entire game library and then to stream it for the sake of SW because it kiils you inside that PS4 is/and already has lost whatever little precious 4-5 'one and done' games it had. :D Since you're getting so desperate, let me give a better alternative instead of PS3 use the android phone and stream Steam games via Steam Link, oh wait....you're after ownage over me regarding PC losing its games to Sony platform....Bwaaaahaaaaaaa, the desperation. All the while I let me just play Bloodborne on my PC without having to build up any hypothetical and non-practical scenario for $20.....oh wait, what is it, I don't even have to pay $20? There's a free 7 day trial. :D Well with steammygame or similar apps you don't have to pay anything and you can do it from anywhere in the world so that effectively makes PC exclusives even less exclusive than PS4 ones lol lol PC_rocks owned.

Couldn't tell you a thing about it now! She was in pyjamas in a heist thing shooting in her mansion. And Ser Jorah was in it. Her walk really makes me laugh, she's going for the badass swagger but it's just a bit comical. I quite liked the first one as well, Jolie had a certain charm. Charm is what the current Lara lacks. I think I'd like to see a bit more of the old Lara, and I want 90's sunglasses, and where are the dual pistols? Losing them after the first game was unforgivable. ====================::==================== Writers of the latest game and Camilla Luddington who does the voice of Lara have said they'd like to see Lara's daughter take over. Not sure I like that idea. I like the idea of this recent trilogy feeding into the original games. The original ending to Shadow actually did that as it featured a letter from Jacqueline Nattler. Although a patch has changed that to a slightly different ending. Only a few people saw the original. I'd like an established Lara but not one that's old with a grown up child. I've been craving playing the old games and Anniversary, so I might dig out the PS2 tonight and hope it still works. I have the games still. It's shame you can't get any of them on playstation NOW. I also watched the run through of the fan made TR II first level. Ugh, watching that makes me wish we'd get some sort of remaster. I'd completely forgotten about the fan level until today, whilst googling for TR info. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6be0UUsN68s",,designer84,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,,,,,Future Tomb Raider games - Page 2,,,

More like want, which I would love to see. But, the console base has shown that they are fine paying for online, and losing compatibility with the previous gen and have to wait for and buy remasters. So I'm not too optimistic about Sony offering something pro consumer like backwards compatibility that can scale with new hardware. Would love to be proved wrong. PS1 and PS2 backwards compatibility support for the PS4 isn't even being bothered with. RPCS3 is pretty much the best chance at being able to revisit my RDR copy in the future without having to deal with the terrible sub 30 fps and 640p resolution. Sony makes great exclusives, but they would probably rather resell previous gen titles again as opposed to offering the ability to let consumers play their old copies at high resolution and fps for free, or push their PSNow subscription service to get a continuous revenue stream over a one time purchase.",,Discoteca,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

178581454397,9/29/2018,http://columbustvrepairpros.tumblr.com/post/178581454397,"Whether you are laid-back, or you’re a pro player, this month we answer the question of “just what is the most effective TV For gaming?”.


4K


True 4k gaming is gradually becomming more accessible, when we compare it with the 1080p platform that we were formerly video gaming on, even computer players were taking into consideration the swap! While not all games can sustain the resolution, 4k was narrowed down to the rich gamer because of costly equipment. Luckily, in a hectic world of technology, new graphics cards are making an appearance, making 4K gaming much more sensible and economical compared to in the past. You could think about 4K LED TVs for their optimal capacity to convey the bright as well as blinking colors typically located in games.


While the PS4 and also the Xbox One don’t support 4K as well as the constraints of the hardware on us, the newer PS4 Pro, the Xbox One S as well as the Xbox One X do. The good news is for all players, the Xbox One X coming out means that soon you will be able to experience full 4K, so be sure to plug one into your 4K television to get the best quality gaming available.


Clearly, with even more pixels the better and the much more in-depth our graphics cards get on video games, the more immersed we really feel, however with restrictions in gaming consoles, we are really hoping that our 4K televisions will be getting some video gaming activity quicker instead of later!


3D


While 3D gaming isn’t one of the most spoken about technologies on the pc gaming scene, it is made use of, and is becomming very trendy. Nonetheless, there’s a lot of technical requirements, system needs and also graphic card knowledge required. You can plug computers with HDMI to your television as well as play 3D video games through your 3D TV, however you could surrender your resolution and quality of graphics for some not terrific quality 3D.


Smart Television


With Smart Television, you don’t even require a console or a link to a computer, as lots have a Smart Hub Game Panel, giving easy access to family friendly games for everybody to enjoy.


An additional plus is that if you’ve got a 4K Samsung Smart TV with accessibility to the Samsung Application shop, you could now stream heavy steam video games straight to your TV. Dealing with the Steam Controller, a wired Xbox 360 controller (for now) as well as a solid internet connection, we are expecting much more controller choices in the future, as well as 4K assistance coming soon.


With a series of Samsung’s Smart TVs, you could attach a pc gaming system in the old-fashioned way, get the applications, such as Gameloft, and also if you sign up for PlayStation Now, you could also play a selection of full-on PS2 games right there with no cables or even a console! Smart TVs are designed to replace a whole raft of gadgets, when it comes to video gaming it certainly does this as well!


If you are a gamer and require a television to use in your pastime, or merely need an upgrade, our staff would be more than pleased to advise you on what’s the best technology for your needs.",,columbustvrepairpros,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,What Is The Most Effective TV For Gaming?,Post,,

That was because of Ballmer. The whole travisty that was the Vista/7 era where Microsoft lost confidence in developers and gamers were because Ballmer thought they were not important. Under Ballmer, they were actually considering selling off the whole Xbox division. Under Nadella, they have already made Microsoft the large open source contributor on the Internet, bought github (which you can argue whether that is good or not, but I see it as a stance to support open source/developers), created WSL, made an effort to make backwards compatibility a thing for Xbox One even though it was ""not possible"" because of the different in CPU architecture, made game pass unified their whole gaming division under Phil Spencer and solidified its place in Microsoft. > Valve has been putting in monumental efforts Valve puts in the minimal possible effort to stay relevant and keep its hold over PC gaming so they can keep raking in their profits. Steam Link was only released after Microsoft did the same thing with the Xbox App for Xbox One -> PC and Sony bought OnLive and introduced Playstation Now (which you could say was in response to rumors of Microsoft working on a similar streaming service). About all of the features they have released in the past 5 or so years have been in response to another feature someone else announced beforehand. Steam Cloud and syncing game saves you could argue was made by the Valve that still gave a fuck (came out in 2008). The only thing that Valve has released in the recent years that impressed me review overhaul to the Steam storefront (with the graph and being able to see number of positive/negative reviews in a given timeframe and everything). They are still riding on this whole ""we hate Microsoft"" hype from the release Windows 8 that Steam on Windows has not been getting the first class features it should be. Microsoft has spent the time since Windows 8 refining a new application lifecycle model for programs (currently called the Universal Windows App platform or UWP), which adds huge benefits for things like gaming as it allows the game to be sandboxed and makes implementing things like anti-cheat much easier. Steam refuses to support these `.appx` packages and as a result, [new Microsoft first-party titles are not going on Steam](https://www.pcgamesn.com/age-of-empires-definitive-edition/age-of-empires-definitive-edition-steam). Valve could team up with Microsoft to enable Steam to publish and install `.appx` applications. And speaking of anti-cheat, the solution Steam provides, VAC, requires you to use their game engine, Source. This requires anyone that does not use the Source Engine to find their own anti-cheat solution for multiplayer. This has lead to many multiplayer games on Steam being riddled with this flavor of the month anti-cheat solutions that are just major security breaches *waiting* to happen. I read through the TOS for BattleEye and it gets way too much power over your system. As soon as that application is compromised (or Easy Anti-Cheat or any of the other ones), everyones computers that have them are going to become compromised. Anti-cheat and stopping users from cheating should be something that Valve actively works towards. Microsoft's anti-cheat implementation, TruePlay, only requires your game to be using their new UWP app container. If Steam supported `.appx` packages then Steam games could take advantage of the work Microsoft has put into a system level anti-cheat implementation.",,angellus,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Project Stream promises to deliver the holy grail to video game fans around the globe – the ability to play the latest AAA games on any laptop or PC via a stable, no-lag streaming service. Google is preparing to publicly test Project Stream with a “limited number of participants” on October 5th, letting them play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey for free in the Chrome browser. That’s the latest game in the Assassin’s Creed series, and it’s a massive open-world adventure packed with 4K-capable graphics.

In a demo video, Google shows Assassin’s Creed Odyssey streaming at 1080p and 60fps.



If all goes to plan, the game should work on any laptop or PC, regardless of how recently you’ve updated the graphics card. However, Google recommends a home internet connection of at least 25 megabits per second. For anyone interested in playing the new Assassin’s Creed on the day it comes out, for free, in the Chrome browser, there’s an application right here.

Google developers said the beta test is meant to push the limits of Project Stream. AAA video games are far more complicated to stream than a movie or TV show, offering dense worlds of animation and input-sensitive information.

“The idea of streaming such graphically-rich content that requires near-instant interaction between the game controller and the graphics on the screen poses a number of challenges,” developers wrote. “When streaming TV or movies, consumers are comfortable with a few seconds of buffering at the start, but streaming high-quality games requires latency measured in milliseconds, with no graphic degradation.”

Rumors have been flying for months about a potential Google-branded streaming service. Initial reports said any such service would link up to Chromecast, allowing users to play AAA games on their TVs without modern consoles. There’s also buzz about Google adding Bluetooth capabilities to the next version of Chromecast, opening up the door to connected gamepads.

Google isn’t alone in the streaming-game space. Sony has PlayStation Now, but it hasn’t exactly solved the lag issue yet, while companies like OnLive have burst onto the scene with big streaming promises only to quietly implode soon after. One of the latest companies to enter the scene is LiquidSky, which has been fairly silent since officially launching in March 2017. Meanwhile, Microsoft is working on a game-streaming service for the next Xbox generation.",,mrcifci,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Google's Project Stream makes 'Assassin's Creed' playable in Chrome,Post,,

It's a sad fact that the great majority of console people don't care about latency, nor do they play games where it would be noticeable anyway. You could probably get away with up to 140ms before it becomes an issue, maybe even higher than that if you were to ask someone like Ubisoft. For those of us that do care we're such a small minority that we simply aren't worth catering for. Not once have I seen anyone ask about the latency on the NeoGeo mini, as an example, and that's what you'd expect to be a bit of specialist kit.

I was part of the early CD-ROM days with a Yamaha CD-ROM burner in 1994. It was well over $3000. It wasn't until 1995 that HP introduced a writer for under $1000 at $995. Worse, the early burners didn't have any cache, so to support the Yamaha, I was using a high-end dual-processor Pentium system that was in the neighborhood of $16,000 and I still got plenty of buffer under-runs! On top of all this, the first writeable CD's I purchased were in the $30/each range. ====================::==================== Sony recently announced they are turning their Playstation Now service into a similar thing (previously it was cloud streamed titles, now you can download the title to your console for a monthly fee) https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/09/20/playstation-now-a...",,joshschreuder,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,When Blockbuster Video Tried Burning Game Cartridges on Demand,,,

That you have to now add a legal requirement to somehow claim ownage and keep PC exclusives valid says a lot about how weak your subjective definition is. This is what happens when you make an arbitrary definition as to what an exclusive means and pretend there is some kind of universal rule behind it. Fine, consider them not exclusives, I'll keep consider them as exclusives because your definition is completely subjective and arbitrary and makes the concept of exclusive obsolete. Lmao, so funny seeing you projecting your insecurity on me. And no, I have outlined many reasons why your desperate argument about an individual streaming to you and that too a hypothetical scenario not a real one is flawed to begin with. No one moved the goal posts apart from cows that they even have to equate 2 completely different things, hence your repeated attempts at 'technicalities doesn't matter' goal post move. No matter what mental gymnastics you do, the mentioned games are no longer exclusives and I don't need a PS4 to play those games. And gladly take off the games from PC exclusives list when the reverse ever happens, so far it didn't. Even then, no matter how you slice it PC will still come out on top and still objectively be a better platform. I understand the desperation because cows bread and butter are max 4-5 'one and done' games and hence their desire to held on to it via any means necessary. Again, don't need a PS4. :D Ciao! But it has been done. Just because you don't know about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Here: https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/20/play-pc-games-on-your-ps3-with-streammygame/, now PC has no exclusives anymore lol. Yeah, Linux enabled PS3 which doesn't exist after the update connected via LAN to 'PC', LMAO. Again goes back to that desperate attempt of putting individual against a corporate provided service where you do need to pay for the base system. Go ahead and play 'all PC games' by first buying the 'PC' and the entire game library and then to stream it for the sake of SW because it kiils you inside that PS4 is/and already has lost whatever little precious 4-5 'one and done' games it had. :D Since you're getting so desperate, let me give a better alternative instead of PS3 use the android phone and stream Steam games via Steam Link, oh wait....you're after ownage over me regarding PC losing its games to Sony platform....Bwaaaahaaaaaaa, the desperation. All the while I let me just play Bloodborne on my PC without having to build up any hypothetical and non-practical scenario for $20.....oh wait, what is it, I don't even have to pay $20? There's a free 7 day trial. :D Well with steammygame or similar apps you don't have to pay anything and you can do it from anywhere in the world so that effectively makes PC exclusives even less exclusive than PS4 ones lol Great, do tell me where do I need to sign up to play PC games on my phone? I would love to play it when I'm free in my office. Until then LOL at PC losing its exclusives because of your imaginary argument based on your imaginary neighbor. In the meantime I can play Bloodborne and the rest of the games on my PC without PS4. :D",,PC_Rocks,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Both my PC and PS4 have similar internet speeds (speedtest said my PC had 220 MB/s and speedtest says my PS4 has 145 MB/s but it also said that the data for my PC was more accurate since I was using the Windows 10 app). So my next concern is input lag: which one has less input lag, PC or PS4? Another concern I have is: can I switch between the 2? For example if I get to a certain point on my PC, can I continue from there on my PS4? And my final question is: are there other factors I have to consider (like 4K, consistent framerate, trophies)?

Microsoft is aware of this and thus have been positioning themselves to take advantage of it. Sony has not revealed what there plans are beyond maybe psnow, so time will tell how they intend to continue playstation in the future. Except that everyone I know that has a PC pirates their games and doesn’t spend a single penny on software. Everybody I know that has a console actually pays for their software.

There are a lot of places you can go to both in person and online that will rent a gaming system to you, and you could rent an Xbox and RDR and beat just the story fairly quickly. I know it’s probably a stretch for you but thought I’d throw it out there since you were already willing to troubleshoot PSnow and spend the $29. For what my personal opinion is worth, you should definitely play through at least the main story once. Not because I think going straight to 2 will take anything away from your experience — but because when I finished RDR1 I sat there stunned for a long time and almost cried.

178637863159,10/1/2018,http://toptechnewsandbuzz.tumblr.com/post/178637863159,"Game streaming offers an enticing alternative to buying either physical or digital games. Aside from the cost of maintaining a subscription to a streaming service being significantly lower than purchasing new games outright, streaming services also allow you to jump into the action without waiting for huge installations and updates.

In the past, streaming services like OnLive failed to catch on — game streaming isn’t for everyone; however, for players with a good, consistent internet connection and a penchant for jumping from game to game without plans to return to any one title, it’s the perfect option.

Here are some of the best game-streaming services you can try right now, with some game recommendations to give you a sense of the games you’ll get to play on each one.

PlayStation Now



Sony has some of the best first-party video games around, but you previously needed to own one of the company’s consoles in order to play them. With PlayStation Now, you can play a wide variety of exclusive PlayStation games from your PC or your PlayStation 4.

On PC, all you need in a DualShock 4 controller with either a wireless adapter or USB mini cable as well as a PlayStation Network account and at least 5 Mbps of internet download speed. PlayStation 4 users need the same internet speed on their game console, and with either a 7-day free trial or a paid subscription, you’re ready to play the best PlayStation exclusives.

For PS4 players, a PlayStation Now subscription includes full access to multiplayer support, even if you have not subscribed to PlayStation Plus. Your save files will be compatible with on both PC and PS4.

PlayStation Now currently features some older PlayStation exclusives, including Killzone: Shadow Fall, The Last of Us, Until Dawn, and God of War III: Remastered. It also supports a number of third-party games, such as Dishonored, Batman: Arkham Origins, BioShock Infinite, and Saints Row IV. New games are added every month, and the full catalog now includes more than 600 titles. PlayStation Now costs $20 for a one-month subscription, or $45 for a three-month subscription.

GeForce Now



Own a Mac or a low-end PC, but want to play the latest AAA games? With GeForce Now, you can play the latest and greatest from major publishers without having to worry about your computer catching fire or, worse, running Bootcamp.

GeForce Now is not a content service like many of the other services on our list. You have to purchase the games you want to play through a digital store, such as Steam, Uplay, or Blizzard’s Battle.net. Once you’ve installed the app on your machine, GeForce’s cloud-based processors will allow you to run the game on any device, independent of their specs.

The service requires a higher internet download speed than GameFly Streaming – 25 Mbps minimum and 50 Mbps recommended – and you must have MacOS 10.10 or higher or Windows 7 64-bit or later in order to run it. Either an Ethernet connection or a Wi-Fi connection using a 5 GHz router is required, and you can use either a mouse-and-keyboard setup or one of several gamepads. Sessions are currently capped at four hours per player before you have to start a new session in order to keep the servers available for other players.

GeForce now is compatible with a huge assortment of games, though you do have to buy them in order to use them with the service. The list includes Assassin’s Creed Origins, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, Injustice 2, Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, and Middle-earth: Shadow of War, to name a few. GeForce Now is currently in beta testing and is free for users during the trial period. You can sign up for the waitlist on the official website.

Jump



The other game streaming services on our list focus primarily on big-budget AAA games from major publishers. That’s great and all, but there are times when you’re more interested in playing an independent game from a small studio, instead, and Jump is the perfect service to do it.

Jump provides a latency-free game streaming service the company says is on par with what you expect from a game fully installed on your device. Whether you’re gaming on a Windows PC, Linux PC, or Mac, you can play the service’s library of games. It also supports both the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive headsets. Your save data is stored in the cloud, so you can always pick up right where you left off, even if you switch devices. Another neat feature: There are no microtransactions in any of Jump’s games.

The one caveat with Jump is that the technology used – dubbed “HyperJump” – uses your local system hardware in order to run games. This means your system will have to be capable of playing the game, though the majority of the games offered through Jump aren’t particularly taxing.

The roster of games you can play with Jump – all of which are included in the $5 monthly subscription cost – includes well-known indie games such as Cook, Serve, Delicious!, Gunhouse, Nidhogg, and The End is Nigh. New games are added every month, and 70 percent of the proceeds go back to the developers whose games are included in the Jump library. You can try a two-week free trial, and subscriptions can be canceled at any time.

GameFly Streaming



Want to play games, but don’t have a console or a gaming PC? Gamefly Streaming, the digital wing of the “Netflix for Games” service, allows you to play a selection of older AAA games on a variety of streaming devices, including the Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, the EMTEC GEM Box, and both Samsung and LG Smart television sets. GameFly Streaming works with nearly any game controller you’ll find in stores. From the PlayStation 4’s DualShock 4 to the Xbox One gamepad, you can pick whichever one suits you the most.

GameFly Streaming also supports local multiplayer games, so a friend can get in on the action, provided they also have a controller. The service saves your data in the cloud for up to 90 days after you cancel your subscription, so you can restart your membership and pick up right where you left off in your favorite title.

Two different subscription packs – “gamer” and “family” — are available through GameFly Streaming, each for under $10 per month. The service requires a 5 Mbps internet speed and suggests 10 Mbps for the best experience, and it supports both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity. If you already own a device capable of running the GameFly streaming app, you can try it for free right now.

Current games available through GameFly streaming include BioShock and BioShock 2, Clustertruck, Bridge Constructor, and Adventure Time: Finn & Jake Investigations.

Honorable mention: Xbox Game Pass



The other services on our list rely on streaming technology to deliver you your games, but Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass works a little differently. For $10 per month, a subscription to Xbox Game Pass gives you access to more than 100 games, and you download them onto your Xbox One’s storage device just like you would with any other digital game.

This means you don’t have to worry about your internet speed affecting the quality of your game experience, and even if you lose your connection, you’ll still be able to play games.

And the games – the games. Xbox Game Pass has perhaps the best library of free games of any service on our list. From Rise of the Tomb Raider to Gears of War 4, nearly every notable Xbox One game you can think of is included through the program, and a selection of Xbox 360 games are also available through backward compatibility. It isn’t limited to Microsoft-published games, either, with a variety of third-party games also available. The kicker, however, is Microsoft’s policy for future Xbox exclusives. All first-party Xbox games going forward will be included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription at no extra charge on launch day. Sea of Thieves is already available, and big-name games like Crackdown 3 and State of Decay 2 are coming later in 2018.",,toptechnewsandbuzz,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,The Best Game Streaming Services,Post,,

Has anyone here tried it out? To me, it looks like this could possibly be the future of gaming.Streaming a game in 4K hosted on dedicated servers meaning no game downloading required and all games saves and purchases are saved on the cloud. You can even purchase the latest games through steam and Uplay as they are supported. What are your thoughts on this? Could this one day do away with console and PC gaming do you think? This box is extremely powerful for such a little device and compared to a high end gaming PC, ps4 pro or Xbox one X it's dirt cheap! This will be a long post I have given my opinions on this on here before, but I'm not a fan of streaming gameplay. This whole ""Netflix of Video Games"" stuff is a load of nonsense. Watching tv on a stream and gaming on a stream are very different things. I recently tried PSNow, and although it was ok, it was well off being at the point where I would ever want it to be my main way to play games. The only thing streaming gameplay has that is better than what we are doing now is that it's instant that is literally all I can think of that is better. But people don't actually seem to mind that they have to download their games, so even this isn't anything special. Look at the reaction to Sony announcing that games on PSNow can be downloaded to your PS4, people are now much more interested in PSNow for this reason alone. Here are the major issues I have with it. It requires an almost perfect internet connection. Ok, you can get away with playing it on a decent connection, it doesn't need to be perfect to play on it, but if you want perfect gameplay streaming, then you need a perfect connection and it's something nobody has. For me, nothing but perfection is going to be enough. If I am going to be moving away from the way I am playing now, then you need to make my experience better or at least as good. If I'm suffering lag or latency issues at any point, then what is the point? How can that ever be acceptable? It may be fine for the casual gamer that is going to play the odd 10 minutes here and there, but for somebody like me that has many gaming sessions, it's just not good enough. Video quality, it looks poor on a stream. Just because it says HD or 4K, that doesn't mean it looks good. Every so often I am seeing a drop in quality and things get blocky. That has been a problem with videos or streaming online for as long as the internet has been around. Compression is a major problem, why would I choose crappy looking compressed video quality over the crisp clear image I have now? Quite simply, I'm not going to accept it, it's a deal breaker. I don't buy a nice monitor for average quality picture. We don't own the games. Geforce Now is better in this case because you can play your Steam and Uplay games, but how long will they have your game available for you to play? We are talking about every game here, it's highly likely they will remove your game at some point or won't ever have your game available to play anyway. Like I if it's not better than what I already have, then why would I bother with it? Mods. As a PC gamer, I love mods, they are great fun and have improved many games over the years and actually even fixed many issues that exist in games. Mods wouldn't be possible for a streaming service. Having that taken away would be another deal breaker for me. They like to make out that streaming is the future, but it's not a better future, not even close to it. It's worse, and I can't see how they could possibly fix the issues I have pointed out above.",,SegaGamer,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Anyone gamed with the Nvidia shield?,,,

I've been saying this was weird for the longest time but no one has pointed it out until now. So today I'm going to point out all the wierd stuff floating around YouTube that no one seems to be talking about. 1. Livestreams of Amazon/Tribal women there is a YT channel that has been appearing on people's recommendation that LIVESTREAMS.... Amazon women. There is nothing wrong about learning about the unknown/ other cultures. But this channel features full nude underage girls as thier thumbnail. I thought it was a joke at first but it's not it's an actual live stream of nude tribal woman of all ages. The comment section proves that no one is there to learn anything about culture, the people, or the history it's literally an audience of pedophiles. If you think I'm lying type in ""Live Amazon"" on YT. 2. Young Yoga and Gymnastic coaches. I look up stretching tutorials all the time so I can better my kicks/splits and I've notice something. If the video is detailed about stretching it ranges from 100k-400k views and the comment section is full of stretching enthusiast. If it has a crotch shot or features children in it's thumbnail it gets 3-30million views and the comment section is full of people openly admitting that they are not there to learn. I literally typed in ""Splits Stretch"" in YT right now and there is a playlist called ""Young Stretch"". I don't think a young person created that playlist. There is nothing wrong with Young people teaching people how to stretch my problem is YouTube does nothing to protect these kids. All this is recommended to me from me browsing regularly with these searches ..... (Dashiexp, Phillip Defranco, Boogie2998, Tricking, Stretching, Taekwando, Flips, PlayStation) now imagine if I was actively searching for this content. I would hate to see what's really on YouTube that is borderline CP and YT needs to do a better job at protecting children.

You probably used the same password and email at many places, and one of those had been compromised. Or you signed in on someone elses console, or something. Or more likely you were ""gamesharing"", aka game stealing. 2) How did they refund multiple games that had already been downloaded and played? That makes no sense. Even in Europe where the laws are more pro-consumer, refunds are only allowed within 14 days of purchase or from the release date (whichever is later), and if the game hasn't been downloaded. 3) You say they used child accounts, but child accounts default to $0.00 wallet spending, and since they had access to the master account, why use the child account? 4) If you made a reference to changing your login details after the incident, I missed it. But that should have been the first thing done. Also, two-step authorization, but I can understand a new owner not knowing about that. Assuming any of this is legit, it sounds from Sony's perspective that you're another whiny ""gamesharing"" person, aka game stealing person, who got screwed by his partner, so they're not going to cover you for it. Why should they, when that activity is against the ToS anyway, and they'd be within their rights to ban your profile and keep any unused money spent on Plus or PSNow subs etc.",,Sheepinator,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

178640693522,10/1/2018,http://immedtech.tumblr.com/post/178640693522,"Project Stream promises to deliver the holy grail to video game fans around the globe – the ability to play the latest AAA games on any laptop or PC via a stable, no-lag streaming service. Google is preparing to publicly test Project Stream with a “limited number of participants” on October 5th, letting them play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey for free in the Chrome browser. That’s the latest game in the Assassin’s Creed series, and it’s a massive open-world adventure packed with 4K-capable graphics.

In a demo video, Google shows Assassin’s Creed Odyssey streaming at 1080p and 60fps.



If all goes to plan, the game should work on any laptop or PC, regardless of how recently you’ve updated the graphics card. However, Google recommends a home internet connection of at least 25 megabits per second. For anyone interested in playing the new Assassin’s Creed on the day it comes out, for free, in the Chrome browser, there’s an application right here.

Google developers said the beta test is meant to push the limits of Project Stream. AAA video games are far more complicated to stream than a movie or TV show, offering dense worlds of animation and input-sensitive information.

“The idea of streaming such graphically-rich content that requires near-instant interaction between the game controller and the graphics on the screen poses a number of challenges,” developers wrote. “When streaming TV or movies, consumers are comfortable with a few seconds of buffering at the start, but streaming high-quality games requires latency measured in milliseconds, with no graphic degradation.”

Rumors have been flying for months about a potential Google-branded streaming service. Initial reports said any such service would link up to Chromecast, allowing users to play AAA games on their TVs without modern consoles. There’s also buzz about Google adding Bluetooth capabilities to the next version of Chromecast, opening up the door to connected gamepads.

Google isn’t alone in the streaming-game space. Sony has PlayStation Now, but it hasn’t exactly solved the lag issue yet, while companies like OnLive have burst onto the scene with big streaming promises only to quietly implode soon after. One of the latest companies to enter the scene is LiquidSky, which has been fairly silent since officially launching in March 2017. Meanwhile, Microsoft is working on a game-streaming service for the next Xbox generation.

You have to look at the health of the entire Playstation sector for Sony.... PS4 = Hardware was Flat year over year mainly because they no longer have the Japanese home market games to themselves. PSN+ = Lost 300k subscribers in the 1st fiscal quarter of this year (april-june) due to the pending cancellation news on PS3 & Vita systems. Once it's officially cancelled next March the numbers will get worse. Vita = Recently announced it's getting discontinued in it's only relevant market, Japan. PSVR = They stated in their earnings that it didn't catch on like they wanted & earnings were flat in the section it's in. Only 3 million sold. Only 1 new VR game shown at their E3 conference. PSNOW = No numbers given means it isn't doing too well. Recently announced downloads but no improvement to the 720p cap on streaming resolution & no new devices added the service. Link to their 1st quarter earnings: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-07-31-playstation-drives-usd17-9-billion-q1-for-sony Looking at the numbers it's clear they have to release the PS5 next year.

It reaffirms that this idea downloading games via subscription is a hit. (Sony does lead they only follow whats successful and sustainable) after being told for month that it was a stupid model by outsiders. Xbox One X owners (aka the device built and marketed for more hardcore enthusiast) will be the best place to play the game. No PC support means more attention being focused on the X due to it being the strongest platform the game will be available on. It's going to look marvelous. Not sure why you aren't grasping this. A lot of crow is going to have to be eaten after today. So basically you wanted reassurance that you're not wasting your money on Game Pass and just received that now that PSNow, which is still a heavily overpriced service IMO, allows you to download some games? Could you not just subscribe, not care about what some people think, and be happy that MS gave you the option for it? They're not exactly looking to take it down anytime soon, they've already considered the service a great success. . I mean I can't get over how much you just assume rereading this. Hopefully you are just playing dumb and it's just you trolling. You can't fathom that someone likes a service you don't and excited to see the industry embrace it and further validity it. Does it even cross your mind that I might buy a PS4 if they offered an equally valuable service for their platform?",,wildstrike1516,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

178652639873,10/1/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/178652639873,"Capcom brought Resident Evil 7 to Nintendo Switch in Japan as a streaming-only game. This seems to have been an experiment of sorts, as the Japanese publisher is now apparently considering bringing some of its other games to the Switch in cloud form in Japan. A spokesperson for the company told the Wall Street Journal that Capcom will make announcements about other cloud games for Switch after it gets a look at the numbers and other metrics for Resident Evil 7.

Sources told WSJ that Capcom is already looking at “other titles” to bring to Japan as streaming-only games. However, it’s not clear what these other games are or when they might be released. Presumably they will be ports, just like Resident Evil 7, but this is not confirmed.

One of the benefits of streaming games from the cloud instead of playing them locally is that it allows the Switch, which is underpowered compared to PS4 and Xbox One, to play more graphically and technically demanding games. However, as with other streaming services like PlayStation Now, the quality of your experience will depend on the strength and reliability of your internet connection.

For Resident Evil 7 on Switch, another matter is that Capcom effectively only rents you the game. For that game, Capcom charged about $18 for 180 days of play. It remains to be seen if the same pricing structure would be implemented for future releases.

Whatever the case, many are predicting that streaming is going to become increasingly popular in the coming years. Electronic Arts recently acquired a streaming company to help with its own streaming ambitions, while Xbox has already confirmed it is working on a game-streaming service that has not yet been announced. Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Microsoft’s streaming service will offer “console-quality” gaming on “any device.” And of course, Sony already has its own streaming service in PlayStation Now.

Take-Two Strauss Zelnick said recently that he believes game-streaming will truly take off in the next 1-3 years.

I know that the games aren't directly connected (aside from reoccurring characters and the fact that there is no main plot leading into the other games) but would it be better to just play them on the PS4 for time sake? ====================::==================== I have no idea who told you that the games aren't directly connected, but they were lying to your face. There are plenty of connections between all the games. You would definitely not understand what's going on in 2, 3, 4 and 5 if you werent aware of what happens in 1. You would also have no idea who people like Kazama (Fuma) or Haruka are. As far as playing Yakuza on PC, you can play 1 & 2 emulated in PCSX2 and 4 & 5 via PSNow if it's available in your region. Only 3 is currently unplayable, but the western release of 3 is so cut down that it's kind of debatable whether or not you should just watch the recap of events that you can access in 4 instead of actually playing it. It's a great game too, but as long as you know what happens story-wise you could probably skip it and be alright. I sincerely doubt we will see 3/4/5 on PC any time soon, as far as i'm aware they aren't even planning on localizing the HD PS4 versions. Kiwami 1 and then possibly Kiwami 2 way down the line are the only ones I realistically coming to PC. 6 had some bullsh*t rumour (more likely to be a typo / oversight from SEGA) abou a PC release, but I can't see the point in playing that unless you played all the previous games since the events of those games (and especially Y5) lead directly into it.",,mapo bridge swandive,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,The Yakuza Series: PC Ports of the older games (rumor)? :: Yakuza 0,,,

I bought psnow a few days ago and have had a problem with adding games onto my list since I’ve bought the service but I saw on another sub that I may be able to get this fixed if I go into my psnow account from a PC. Problem is my pc won’t be fixed until I get more money so I’m hoping to ‘faux borrow’ one of yours. From my understand all you’d have to do is have good internet and be willing to download the psnow app onto your pc, log in using my username and pw and add any game onto my list. Doing this from a pc will apparently enable and solve my problem on my ps4. A person who already has psnow or experience with psnow is a bonus but not necessarily needed.

Google just announced “Project Stream,” a “technical test” of a service designed to stream AAA video games à la Playstation Now and GeForce Now. We’ve heard rumors of a “Project Yeti” gaming service for some time now, and this looks to be the first sign of a real “Google Gaming” product.

The Project Stream test will involve streaming Ubisoft's Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to desktop-class Chrome browsers, which means it will work on Windows, macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS. Google’s blog post says that a “limited number of participants” will be able to try the game for free starting October 5. A 25Mbps Internet connection is “recommended” for the service, and you’ll need accounts with Google and Ubisoft. For controls, you have options of a keyboard and mouse or a USB (not Bluetooth) game controller. Google says a recent Xbox or Playstation controller will work fine. Provided you are 17 years or older and live in the US, you can sign up at projectstream.google.com.

Game-streaming services are still in their infancy, but the idea applies the standard “cloud computing” thinking to video games. Rather than have players buy and maintain their own expensive gaming hardware, game streaming offloads that compute work to the cloud and streams down only what you need (a video feed) over the Internet. When done correctly, the services allow for high-fidelity games on minimal hardware.

I know that characters from the first game are in the second, but that's about it. ====================::==================== User Info: caboose84 caboose84 4 days ago #9 Well, the point of most prequels seems to be fan service, they typically expect you to have at least an understanding of who the characters are, and the events of the previous games/sequels. I don’t think I’ve ever seen/played a prequel that worked particularly well as a stand-alone experience, or at least as an entry-point to a series. God of War: Ascension for example would be a terrible game to start the series with, because it talks about events that are uncovered/learned of in the first GoW, and expects you to know who Kratos is, how he became the Ghost of Sparta, who Ares/Zeus are, etc. My point is, you could only benefit from playing through Red Dead Redemption before playing the 2nd, even if it is a prequel, because like virtually every prequel in existence, it expects you to know who some of these characters are, and it will no doubt reference or foreshadow events that are going to happen in the first. Plus, like others have said in previous topics about this, if you ever intend on going back and playing the original, it’ll only feel that much more dated and clunky in comparison to this one. You can play it on the PS3, 360, XONE through backwards compatibility, or PS4 through PSNow, and it’s like $15-$20 for the GotY Edition with all of the DLC, so it’s not like it’s a hard game to get ahold of and play. I just don’t see why you wouldn’t wanna play it before playing the 2nd game.

The controller is better in some ways, mostly battery life, and durability, but I prefer the controller itself. The interface on the Xbox is so much worse... It's so hard to figure out what you're doing unless your familiar with it, and browsing the store is the worst experience I've ever had with an online store, the Nintendo store is better imo. The online is strongly debatable as well, Xbox tends to get more annoying kids and salty players, and that gets infuriating quickly. Backwards compatibility is definitely true, but there isn't much on the previous generation I even still want to play, I feel like last generation was more of a transition period that had a lot of failures with some good stuff mixed in. The achievements are also debatable, I prefer the trophy a lot better, saying plat is much easier than saying you got a thousand for a game, and to me gives a greater sense of accomplishment. The graphics are debatable as well, I've directly compared the same titles right next to each other on both, and even though the Xbox has higher specs, it often looks the exact same or worse, it's like they have bad drivers for their own system. I can admit the game pass has some nice games, but I prefer the vast selection of PlayStation now, and the easy access on other devices.",,thingamajig1987,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Although a patch has changed that to a slightly different ending. Only a few people saw the original. I'd like an established Lara but not one that's old with a grown up child. I've been craving playing the old games and Anniversary, so I might dig out the PS2 tonight and hope it still works. I have the games still. It's shame you can't get any of them on playstation NOW.

RAAAWWWRRR posted... wildstrike1516 posted... RDR2 developer confirm game will not come to PC making the X THE place to play that game for the best graphical experience. WHAT A WEEK!!!!!!!!! Wait really? I wasn't going nuts. Apparently a dev said this in a stream related to the game and it was translated poorly. https://gamingbolt.com/red-dead-redemption-2-absolutely-not-coming-to-pc-rockstar-says R* did something similar with GTA5. Said they had no plans to release a PC version. 18 months later... They stand to lose a lot of money ignoring that market. It’ll come. Yeah I recall shortly before GTAV’s release them saying something like they’re dedicated to supporting the game that they’re releasing and aren’t looking into other platforms, seemingly knocking the idea of 8th gen console and PC release. Not long after release did rumors from noteworthy companies like Intel suggest it was releasing after all before R* finally confirmed it themselves. That same thing could happen here. We’ve seen developers change their plans and counteract their promises before, From Software did it twice by saying Dark Souls and then later Dark Souls 2 would never have DLC. Then again, maybe they are going to stick to their guns and just keep it console exclusive. Who knows, and who cares? Well, aside from wildstrike, apparently, as he seems excited that a large market is getting locked out of a big game for no good reason.... I listed off things xbox fans have to be excited about but you are just lying and making assumption out of what I said. What came across is that you listed reasons you’re excited. How is it exciting for an Xbox fan that PSNow lets you download PS2 and PS4 games to a PS4 console? How is it exciting to literally anyone at all besides the most hardcore of Xbox fanboys that a multi-platform game isn’t going to PC? It reaffirms that this idea downloading games via subscription is a hit. (Sony does lead they only follow whats successful and sustainable) after being told for month that it was a stupid model by outsiders. Xbox One X owners (aka the device built and marketed for more hardcore enthusiast) will be the best place to play the game. No PC support means more attention being focused on the X due to it being the strongest platform the game will be available on. It's going to look marvelous. Not sure why you aren't grasping this. A lot of crow is going to have to be eaten after today.",,wildstrike1516,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

For every Witcher 3 there's 10 Assassins Creed, Shadow of War monetised broken up games. Exclusives are made to sell the console so they usually don't need to monetise the game further than the initial price and DLC. If it wasn't like that then I can see these publishers just push games as a live service instead. For current consoles that are out, I'm more for allowing developers to make their full vision, even if that means exclusivity. Just look at the behind the scenes interviews for Spider-Man where they were allowed to do anything they wanted ""if it improved the game"" mainly because that game will push console sales. If it wasn't like that, I'm more inclined to think that it would be ""No, try to put cosmetics here for microtransactions"". Hell I don't even think without exclusivity God Of War would have been funded. Indie games have they own ethos, and Yes it's great Square is pushing PC ports. I agree it would be nice if old exclusive games were ported around to maintain the life of that IP, unfortunately I don't see it happening because Sony and others will put it on their PSNow type service next generation.

In eShop and user settings Switch online is under ""pass"" section, so firmware and store are ready for managing various subscription based services. This will likely lead to SNES game collection and other retro consoles. Probably at additional cost. Nintendo is clearly being inspired by EA/Origin Access and Xbox Game Pass. They will most likely not give us new games unlike EA or Microsoft did, but SNES, N64, Gamecube, Wii and Gameboys are most likely to happen. They might even go for some sort of Indie Game Pass. There's already a lot of indie games on eShop with huge discounts. I bet many developers would happily agreed to give their games for such a pass and get some $$$ based on popularity withing such service. Anyway this is Nintendo, so logic don't apply here. I wonder if they are aware that they are loosing money. I haven't bought single game for Switch since I've been using Xbox Game Pass. There's so many games and new are added every month (Forza Horizon 4 will arrive next week), that I simply don't have time to play on Switch. There's also Playstation Now streaming subscription that recently allowed for downloading games on PS4, just like Xbox Game Pass.

Remote control: Wi-Fi remote control instead of IR remote control and is to have Touchpad(such like in laptop) for cursor movement instead of up,down,left,right buttons. And joysticks for Gamers it should be wireless. Mobile App for TV: OnePlus TV remote app for mobile it can control the TV through Wi-Fi. Games App: If OnePlus TV supports games app, Gamers can paly games on TV without connecting PlayStation. I'm not to sure about using WiFi for a standard remote. I believe bt low energy could be a better solution seen from a battery life, and input latency perspective. Personally I do not see the benefits of using a trackpad while navigating a TV GUI. Plus, to enable you to control connected devices to the TV you whole need to have them (google Consumer Electronics Control). However if you are more focused on running Android apps on it, I could see the benefits. Android app for TV things could work. when you mentioned game app, did you mean you want to play PlayStation games without a PlayStation?

It reaffirms that this idea downloading games via subscription is a hit. (Sony does lead they only follow whats successful and sustainable) after being told for month that it was a stupid model by outsiders. Xbox One X owners (aka the device built and marketed for more hardcore enthusiast) will be the best place to play the game. No PC support means more attention being focused on the X due to it being the strongest platform the game will be available on. It's going to look marvelous. Not sure why you aren't grasping this. A lot of crow is going to have to be eaten after today. So basically you wanted reassurance that you're not wasting your money on Game Pass and just received that now that PSNow, which is still a heavily overpriced service IMO, allows you to download some games? Could you not just subscribe, not care about what some people think, and be happy that MS gave you the option for it? They're not exactly looking to take it down anytime soon, they've already considered the service a great success. And for RDR2, again, why is it good news to anyone who isn't a massive fanboy for a specific console or just consoles in general that PC won't get a multi-platform game? You're still getting the game on your platform of choice regardless, so it's really just bad news for PC players hoping to play RDR2 for themselves. It's awesome you'll enjoy the game, and it's awesome it'll look nice on all consoles it's available on, but how is it at all good news that one specific platform isn't getting one specific game? That's what I'm not grasping is why you act like it's something to get hyped about. Here you go again......................... I don't need reassurance for anything. If you think I do again you are just assuming. In fact all you are doing is assuming. As for the trolls that fill this board which you typically fall on the side of yeah it does matter. All I read is subscription is a joke. Again just shows you are arguing for the sake of arguing. As for PC players being left out, I guess that ""what good games does Xbox have that I can't get on my PC"" stuff can be put to rest. I think exclusives suck but for all the trolls around here it's nice just to see things sway the opposite of what they all beat their chest about.",,wildstrike1516,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Google just announced “Project Stream,” a “technical test” of a service designed to stream AAA video games à la Playstation Now and GeForce Now. We’ve heard rumors of a “Project Yeti” gaming service for some time now, and this looks to be the first sign of a real “Google Gaming” product.

The Project Stream test will involve streaming Ubisoft's Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to desktop-class Chrome browsers, which means it will work on Windows, macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS. Google’s blog post says that a “limited number of participants” will be able to try the game for free starting October 5. A 25Mbps Internet connection is “recommended” for the service, and you’ll need accounts with Google and Ubisoft. For controls, you have options of a keyboard and mouse or a USB (not Bluetooth) game controller. Google says a recent Xbox or Playstation controller will work fine. Provided you are 17 years or older and live in the US, you can sign up at projectstream.google.com.

Game-streaming services are still in their infancy, but the idea applies the standard “cloud computing” thinking to video games. Rather than have players buy and maintain their own expensive gaming hardware, game streaming offloads that compute work to the cloud and streams down only what you need (a video feed) over the Internet. When done correctly, the services allow for high-fidelity games on minimal hardware.

Sounds like a bad idea to me, the last thing any game needs is for a split player base. (it's precisely why franchises are moving away from season passes). Frankly, if anyone is keen to play games with keyboard and mouse, go buy a PC. As someone in a comment elsewhere said: MS have taken a Windows PC and turned it into a games console, and have now turned that games console into a PC. So your goal to not split a playerbase.... is to split a player base. Just brilliant. The applicability of cross play will depend on the game in question and as gears of war showed us needs to be tested instead of people blindly making assumptions. The main issue consoles are facing is pc is growing very quickly and is not slowing down (it has in fact surpassed the entire console market from what I understand). Microsoft is aware of this and thus have been positioning themselves to take advantage of it. Sony has not revealed what there plans are beyond maybe psnow, so time will tell how they intend to continue playstation in the future.",,Suntory_Times,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

The PS4 is the only console platform that has exclusives. Everything else is better on the PC. Hell, if Bloodborne was on the PC, I'd say don't even consider a console and just upgrade/build another PC. Bloodborne is playable on PC via PSNow. Also in terms of the exclusives thing, is the guy looking to buy a PC or a console here? Obviously he wants a console and has a budget, so whether or not some games are better or shared with PC or not is an irrelevance.

Click to expand... It was nice on Wii and Wii U, but now? No thanks. I'll gladly pay a subscription service to have access to these games in bulk format, rather than buy them individually, all over again. Click to expand... I think this fails to take into account consumers beyond the core Nintendo fanbase. Switch has been a success and ideally, it will continue to appeal to new gamers, young gamers, and people who Nintendo lost over the last couple of generations. Wii U undersold and it has been 6 years since the end of the Wii era. That means there are likely a lot of Switch owners who never took advantage of the Virtual Console. There are definite advantages to being able to buy select classics and the fact that many of us (in the niche, core Nintendo fanbase) have done it before doesn't negate that. There are probably people who'd like to pay once to own Mario Kart 64 and be able to play it anywhere rather than having to pay a yearly fee to have access to a bunch of games that don't interest them. I think a subscription service and an online store can coexist. Sony has Playstation Now, but I'm pretty sure it also hosts games from older generations on the Playstation Store. Perhaps being subscribed to Nintendo's online service gives you occasional discounts on VC items.",,BIGBMH,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Has anyone here tried it out? To me, it looks like this could possibly be the future of gaming.Streaming a game in 4K hosted on dedicated servers meaning no game downloading required and all games saves and purchases are saved on the cloud. You can even purchase the latest games through steam and Uplay as they are supported. What are your thoughts on this? Could this one day do away with console and PC gaming do you think? This box is extremely powerful for such a little device and compared to a high end gaming PC, ps4 pro or Xbox one X it's dirt cheap! This will be a long post I have given my opinions on this on here before, but I'm not a fan of streaming gameplay. This whole ""Netflix of Video Games"" stuff is a load of nonsense. Watching tv on a stream and gaming on a stream are very different things. I recently tried PSNow, and although it was ok, it was well off being at the point where I would ever want it to be my main way to play games. The only thing streaming gameplay has that is better than what we are doing now is that it's instant..........that is literally all I can think of that is better. But people don't actually seem to mind that they have to download their games, so even this isn't anything special. Look at the reaction to Sony announcing that games on PSNow can be downloaded to your PS4, people are now much more interested in PSNow for this reason alone. Here are the major issues I have with it. It requires an almost perfect internet connection. Ok, you can get away with playing it on a decent connection, it doesn't need to be perfect to play on it, but if you want perfect gameplay streaming, then you need a perfect connection and it's something nobody has. For me, nothing but perfection is going to be enough. If I am going to be moving away from the way I am playing now, then you need to make my experience better or at least as good. If I'm suffering lag or latency issues at any point, then what is the point? How can that ever be acceptable? It may be fine for the casual gamer that is going to play the odd 10 minutes here and there, but for somebody like me that has many gaming sessions, it's just not good enough. Video quality, it looks poor on a stream. Just because it says HD or 4K, that doesn't mean it looks good. Every so often I am seeing a drop in quality and things get blocky. That has been a problem with videos or streaming online for as long as the internet has been around. Compression is a major problem, why would I choose crappy looking compressed video quality over the crisp clear image I have now? Quite simply, I'm not going to accept it, it's a deal breaker. I don't buy a nice monitor for average quality picture. We don't own the games. Geforce Now is better in this case because you can play your Steam and Uplay games, but how long will they have your game available for you to play? We are talking about every game here, it's highly likely they will remove your game at some point or won't ever have your game available to play anyway. Like I if it's not better than what I already have, then why would I bother with it? Mods. As a PC gamer, I love mods, they are great fun and have improved many games over the years and actually even fixed many issues that exist in games. Mods wouldn't be possible for a streaming service. Having that taken away would be another deal breaker for me. They like to make out that streaming is the future, but it's not a better future, not even close to it. It's worse, and I can't see how they could possibly fix the issues I have pointed out above.",,SegaGamer,United Kingdom,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Google just announced “Project Stream,” a “technical test” of a service designed to stream AAA video games à la Playstation Now and GeForce Now. We’ve heard rumors of a “Project Yeti” gaming service for some time now, and this looks to be the first sign of a real “Google Gaming” product.


The Project Stream test will involve streaming Ubisoft's Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to desktop-class Chrome browsers, which means it will work on Windows, macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS. Google’s blog post says that a “limited number of participants” will be able to try the game for free starting October 5. A 25Mbps Internet connection is “recommended” for the service, and you’ll need accounts with Google and Ubisoft. For controls, you have options of a keyboard and mouse or a USB (not Bluetooth) game controller. Google says a recent Xbox or Playstation controller will work fine. Provided you are 17 years or older and live in the US, you can sign up at projectstream.google.com.


Game-streaming services are still in their infancy, but the idea applies the standard “cloud computing” thinking to video games. Rather than have players buy and maintain their own expensive gaming hardware, game streaming offloads that compute work to the cloud and streams down only what you need (a video feed) over the Internet. When done correctly, the services allow for high-fidelity games on minimal hardware.

The hard part is latency. If you’re playing a video game at 60fps, these services have 16 milliseconds to receive a button press over the Internet, render a new, live video frame, and send it back to you. This all has to happen with around zero lag or buffering, or playing the game will be very frustrating.

VIDEO

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey running on Google’s Project Stream.

Because this is just a “technical test,” Project Stream isn’t the launch of a full-fledged commercial gaming service from Google, but it’s obviously the beginnings of such a plan. Google’s blog post spends a lot of time talking about just how hard game streaming is and how the company wants to get it right. Google already runs some of the world’s most popular and/or bandwidth-intensive sites on the Internet (YouTube, Google.com) and has done low-latency streaming work with YouTube’s live-streaming service. It develops Google Chrome, the world’s most popular browser, and is not afraid to develop new protocols and codecs to make the Internet faster, cheaper, and more profitable. If Google really wanted to throw a ton of resources behind this gaming project, it is one of the few companies with enough control over the entire Internet stack that it could do something special.


Project Steam isn’t the only streaming platform Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is headed to. In Japan, the game will also be streamable to the Nintendo Switch starting October 5th. On the other consoles, Odyssey is limited to 30FPS, so the 60FPS version on Project Stream could be one of the best versions of the game.


Like any game console, a commercial Google Gaming service would live or die by its game selection. When we last heard of Google’s “Project Yeti,” the company was reportedly doing the rounds at the 2018 Game Developers Conference and E3 to drum up developer support for the service. The report claimed that if developers didn’t come willingly, the possibility of “major acquisitions” was on the table. Google also hired ex-Playstation and Xbox executive Phil Harrison this year, and he took the position of “Vice President and GM” of some mysterious Google division.

Yeti has supposedly been in the works for over two years, with executives from the Google Hardware team leading the project. For now, Google is sidestepping the hardware question with a test on Chrome, but internal versions of Yeti have been considered for the Chromecast or gaming-specific hardware.

Just brilliant. The applicability of cross play will depend on the game in question and as gears of war showed us needs to be tested instead of people blindly making assumptions. The main issue consoles are facing is pc is growing very quickly and is not slowing down (it has in fact surpassed the entire console market from what I understand). Microsoft is aware of this and thus have been positioning themselves to take advantage of it. Sony has not revealed what there plans are beyond maybe psnow, so time will tell how they intend to continue playstation in the future. Except that everyone I know that has a PC pirates their games and doesnt spend a single penny on software. Everybody I know that has a console actually pays for their software. So, PC may have outgrown consoles, but is it really financially viable for the companies producing content for it? That begs the question, how long will publishers keep supporting PC?",,Petra_Kalbrain,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,F,,,,PS4 Cross Play Beta,,,

However, this has been one of my top 5 hidden gems of the year. It's a point and click interactive with quick time events, investigations, passive interrogations, and puzzles. All of those things mixed together by themselves would have been good enough for me, but it goes one step by further with surprisingly rather detailed environments and an intriguing little story. Trophies weren't hard at all yet this game somehow sits at a 9% completion rate. Just figured I'd let you know if you were considering playing but hadn't for whatever reason. It's worth it and is currently on playstation now for anyone who might have a subscription. ====================::==================== Yes, it's names Red Johnson'Chronicles: One Against All, it's a different story (continuation from the 1st one, I think, but it been so long that I don't remember much and what I remember, I'm not sure if it's from the 1st or the 2nd, probably is just from the 2nd). The main thing that I remember is that there were more QTE sections, but it's build mainly using the same style as the 1st one.

If they said it repeatedly, people would have the same reaction each time Except the we don't know what exactly Kodera meant by PlayStation Brand will be crouching down to grow further. Most have taken that to mean no PS5 in the next 3 years, but he could have been talking about other things. Kodura is the Cloyd Based Gaming guy at Sony. Kodura's main focus in the PlayStation Brand has been PlayStation Network, PlayStation Now, and PlayStation Vue. Meanwhile Cerny, the console guy at Sony, repeatedly said they have no plans to change their approach to console cycles, and the Pro was a mid gen upgrade. Last year Cerny was rumored to be working with AMD on the new PS5 chip designs, and earlier this year he's been visiting multiple game studios. There's also been rumors that developers have already been received PS5 dev kits and are working on next gen games. As for Sony being unlikely to release the PS5 next year when they still have major titles coming out... That's not an issue.

Has one of the best standby features on any portable device I've ever owned, including my cellphones. Can be on standby for over a week, just press the button and you are ready to jump in the game. Despite the library being constantly railed on, it contains some of the best portable iterations of games to ever exist. Some of these games even considered timeless classics. Examples: Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3. Nowhere else does there exist such a smooth port portable for this game. Non moving backrounds, it is compromised from the main versions, but it still looks and runs and most importantly plays incredibly smooth for a portable fighter. You can get the zero infinite combo off, that's all that matters. Ninja Gaiden Sigma. Honestly this is the game that made me get a vita. This game has a special place in my heart and I just wanted a portable version. It does run at 30fps which takes some adjusting, but in my experience it has never once dipped below a stable 30. Remains completely functional and playable at all times. MGS 2-3. Can Be found for pretty cheap these days, if youve never played them they run great on the go. Not to mention vita exclusives that have been ported to other systems still play better on vita. Tearaway and gravity rush give an entirely exclusive vita experience you won't get anywhere else despite being on ps4 not even with the ps4 controller. And if you do get a vita you really should get both of these games, they give the vita a lot of charm. The vita system itself is comfortable. It doesn't have a dingy dpad. The clicks are satisfying. Good for sidescrollers and fighting games. Touch screen is good for VA's to advance text. Back touch screen is good for emulating other buttons for remote play. Basically, It's just incredibly solid design, it can function as anything you want for gaming. feels good to hold and play with, as opposed to a 3ds which seems kind of uncomfortable and cheap in comparison. Almost all the games can be found for dirt cheap since the system is dead and forgotten Its a dead/dying system, a lot of the cool apps in the heyday are discontinued RIP psnow ;( Battery life isn't good, you'll need a portable charger, got mine for pretty cheap. A vita can last me a 13 hour planeride if im playing ps1/lower graphic games. If I wanted to play something like gravity rush straight through I'd probably only get 8 hours with it even with the portable charger. Maybe 9. Once you played about the 2 or 3 vita exclusives (gravity rush, tearaway, killzone) you'll realize theres nothing else but ports and more ports. But theres a certain kind of joy for me playing some games on a vita over anything else (for example the popular indie downwell is a joy to play on the vita due to the option to tilt the screen vertical. It really does feel more like an arcade game at that point, its a wonderful novelty. Theres a handful of other games that do this as well such as the flower game from the atelier guys) Aside from the ports are anime based games but kind of designed in a very specific fan service style. That's also a huge sliver of the vita pie. Some can be quite fun though such as the Atelier series, and most run and look pretty nice on the vita's OLED. Right now I'm using my vita to play Kingdom Hearts remote play and Dead Rising, and seeing both of these games ((60fps!!!!!) on a portable is mindblowing. I just bought a ps4 this month so my vita that i bought 2012 still has ways of surprising the hell out of me",,FelineCyborg,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,,,,,,,,

Although it’s kinda hard to find the 12 month subscription on your playstation, that is $99. So if you do the month by month subscription you’d end up paying around $240 for the year. Just me, but definitely worth just putting away some money for a few months before getting it so you don’t overpay!!",,malhans,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I like how Sony still managed to sneaky in bits about it making ""business sense"" in the wording ====================::==================== Quote: : So your goal to not split a playerbase.... is to split a player base. Just brilliant. The applicability of cross play will depend on the game in question and as gears of war showed us needs to be tested instead of people blindly making assumptions. The main issue consoles are facing is pc is growing very quickly and is not slowing down (it has in fact surpassed the entire console market from what I understand). Microsoft is aware of this and thus have been positioning themselves to take advantage of it. Sony has not revealed what there plans are beyond maybe psnow, so time will tell how they intend to continue playstation in the future. Except that everyone I know that has a PC pirates their games and doesnt spend a single penny on software. Everybody I know that has a console actually pays for their software. So, PC may have outgrown consoles, but is it really financially viable for the companies producing content for it? That begs the question, how long will publishers keep supporting PC?",,Petra_Kalbrain,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,F,,,,PS4 Cross Play Beta,,,

However, this has been one of my top 5 hidden gems of the year. It's a point and click interactive with quick time events, investigations, passive interrogations, and puzzles. All of those things mixed together by themselves would have been good enough for me, but it goes one step by further with surprisingly rather detailed environments and an intriguing little story. Trophies weren't hard at all yet this game somehow sits at a 9% completion rate. Just figured I'd let you know if you were considering playing but hadn't for whatever reason. It's worth it and is currently on playstation now for anyone who might have a subscription. ====================::==================== 1 minute ago, Han_the_Dragon said: If you liked this, then play the 2nd game, I remember it being as good as the 1st one (but I played it around the release, so it was a long time ago..).

Figured I'd drop $20 on psnow and get a month of RDR to get used to the series again. I have 25mbps download and I'm using an ethernet cable, yet the game runs like solid ass. No input lag, which is nice, but it will freeze _constantly_. Usually for only a second or two, but then it will play it super fast to catch back up. It is non stop, happening no matter where I am in the game world. Any ideas why, or what (if anything) I can do to fix this?

Could be false just like all the PS5 Dev Kit rumors could. Click to expand... That's missing the point and why I responded to MrFox. Thurrott put his neck on the line by being very specific and will look the fool if he got had. It brings more credibility than general maybe this, maybe that. ====================::==================== DieH@rd said: ↑ And if PS5 launches in late 2019, IMO PS4 Pro looses its reason to be on the market. At that point, Pro should get discontinued and fully BC-capable PS5 slotted in its $400€ place. After all, it will boot PS4 games in Pro mode with high-res rendering & all. Base PS4 can continue selling [hopefully with 7nm APU and pricedrop] until all currently announced 1st party titles are out [some will be 2020 most likely] and major 3rd party support switches to gen9. Click to expand... Potentially. I hope for a two tier launch. If there is one, I think you're absolutely right: the Pro wouldn't have a market. But, if there's a $200 PS4 Super Slim and a $450-$500 PS5, a mid-tier device would continue to attract sales IMO. It's part of the reason I like the idea of a two tier launch: release a $200 7nm PS4 without an HDD or ODD, with a focus on Remote Play and PSNow. Better integrate PSNow, so, in addition to its current functionality, you can stream any game you own digitally. Now, people can buy PS5 games before they buy a PS5, and the cost of entry into the ecosystem is minimal. All the while, Sony are getting their PSNow subscription money. $400 has proven to be a successful launch price. So launch the PS5 at that price, with a focus on 30fps 1440p and above, and simultaneously launch the PS5 Pro with a focus on 60fps 4K (reconstructed or otherwise,) at a much higher price. This is the device on which PSNow games would run, with the higher framerate and resolution somewhat compensating for the inherent shortcomings of streaming. And for big, fat nerds like all of us, that latter device would be irresistible",,Tkumpathenurpahl,Germany,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Next Generation Hardware Speculation with a Technical Spin [2018] | Page 135,,,

While there isn't currently much to write home about in regards to Nintendo's Online service, I must say the way they have handled the classic games has been great, and something many fans had hoped Nintendo would do for a very long time. It's one clean app, and the games are offered to you in a Netflix style. I imagine (hope) they will do this for each console. One app per console as they continue to add more and more games to each console. Nice and organized. But if they bring the old format back, that would mean purchasing individual games...all over again. No thanks. Wii and Wii U was enough, I'm not doing that crap again. Not only is it messy to have hundreds of VC games littering your eShop, it's also very expensive. A Netflix style of delivery is much better for the consumer and actually adds value to the Online service in the long run. I hope this code is simply a reference to future apps they will be adding, the same way they rolled out the NES app. Here's hoping Nintendo doesn't screw up one of the few good things they have done with their new service. ====================::==================== Ahmed1000 said: ↑ nookfan said: ↑ I would much rather have a robust library of games that I can purchase and own, myself. Click to expand... It was nice on Wii and Wii U, but now? No thanks. I'll gladly pay a subscription service to have access to these games in bulk format, rather than buy them individually, all over again. Click to expand... I think this fails to take into account consumers beyond the core Nintendo fanbase. Switch has been a success and ideally, it will continue to appeal to new gamers, young gamers, and people who Nintendo lost over the last couple of generations. Wii U undersold and it has been 6 years since the end of the Wii era. That means there are likely a lot of Switch owners who never took advantage of the Virtual Console. There are definite advantages to being able to buy select classics and the fact that many of us (in the niche, core Nintendo fanbase) have done it before doesn't negate that. There are probably people who'd like to pay once to own Mario Kart 64 and be able to play it anywhere rather than having to pay a yearly fee to have access to a bunch of games that don't interest them. I think a subscription service and an online store can coexist. Sony has Playstation Now, but I'm pretty sure it also hosts games from older generations on the Playstation Store. Perhaps being subscribed to Nintendo's online service gives you occasional discounts on VC items.",,BIGBMH,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,I really hope Nintendo sticks with the new classic games format.,,,

178653931691,10/1/2018,http://nikhilshakya5.tumblr.com/post/178653931691,"Capcom brought Resident Evil 7 to Nintendo Switch in Japan as a streaming-only game. This seems to have been an experiment of sorts, as the Japanese publisher is now apparently considering bringing some of its other games to the Switch in cloud form in Japan. A spokesperson for the company told the Wall Street Journal that Capcom will make announcements about other cloud games for Switch after it gets a look at the numbers and other metrics for Resident Evil 7.

Sources told WSJ that Capcom is already looking at “other titles” to bring to Japan as streaming-only games. However, it’s not clear what these other games are or when they might be released. Presumably they will be ports, just like Resident Evil 7, but this is not confirmed.

One of the benefits of streaming games from the cloud instead of playing them locally is that it allows the Switch, which is underpowered compared to PS4 and Xbox One, to play more graphically and technically demanding games. However, as with other streaming services like PlayStation Now, the quality of your experience will depend on the strength and reliability of your internet connection.

For Resident Evil 7 on Switch, another matter is that Capcom effectively only rents you the game. For that game, Capcom charged about $18 for 180 days of play. It remains to be seen if the same pricing structure would be implemented for future releases.

Whatever the case, many are predicting that streaming is going to become increasingly popular in the coming years. Electronic Arts recently acquired a streaming company to help with its own streaming ambitions, while Xbox has already confirmed it is working on a game-streaming service that has not yet been announced. Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Microsoft’s streaming service will offer “console-quality” gaming on “any device.” And of course, Sony already has its own streaming service in PlayStation Now.

Take-Two Strauss Zelnick said recently that he believes game-streaming will truly take off in the next 1-3 years.

Instead of needing a powerful computer, you'll be able to log in to some online server and play any game you want at 1080p or even higher. The server runs the game you receive a stream of the game. Like a Netflix for games, Playstation now is already trying this model. The pros will be any computer will be able to play any game, console or otherwise and space requirements won't be a thing, as you aren't installing anything. However, the drawback to all of this will most likely be that some games may not even be released and can only be accessed through their online streaming service, which will almost certainly be a subscription model. Companies will love it because it will be near impossible to pirate, players will not technically own their games, and everyone is playing the same version of the game. And like @Steel implied, games will die when the server shuts down with no way of preserving them. I don't think this is all bad necessarily, just what I believe the outcome of this technology will be.",,Defy,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

It's universally available and true for anyone: Not met by PSNow since it is not available in the majority of countries 2. It's replicated easily everywhere: Not met by PSNow since it requires a high enough bandwidth which is not available in the majority of countries 3. It's available every time or vast majority of time: So if I put my PC on streaming and let it on does it count? 4. Providing or dealing with the base system is no longer a user's headache: if your friend comes and has a computer that is streaming at his place you don't even have to notice so you don't need any headache. These are all arbitrary requirements that you came up with but that have no bearing with any authority on the matter and weren't discussed by anyone, you just decided to arbitrarily choose them to leave out other options. Now you're also putting having a friend as something you can't rely on? Come on, stop moving the goalposts in such ridiculous ways.

I know I'll need to source a hdmi cable and controller, what else should I be looking at? I was googling about Playstation Now, seems worthwhile? With regards to controllers, I'm wondering is it better to get cheap 3rd party or second hand legit? Where's handy in brick and mortar? Any other suggestions? ====================::==================== Didn't bother with Playstation Now yet, although I reckon my internet would be fine. Grabbed Battlefield 1, it was a fiver on the PSN - it's fine. Campaign is short, already finished the first 2, but enjoyable. Had to get Fortnite, my nephew had me driven demented, and he's taken great fun in reminding me how bad I am at it. Waiting for Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor to be delivered, and have Red Dead 2 on pre-order, which is the only reason I wanted a playstation in the first place, so that should keep me occupied until the end of the year I'd say. Figured out how to set up HDMI device link last night, that has entertained me - didn't realise it would also work for the Sky box, so I can more or less stash the TV remote away now.",,,Ireland,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Just got a PS4, what next?",,,

So I thought perhaps it was an error on their side, I've tried it today & it's saying the same thing again. Has anyone had any issues with theirs recently? What can I do? It's more annoying because lately i keep getting software errors, & games & streaming T.V or films just cut off when they feel like it. So I resorted to playing these games on here hoping another software update would fix it. Now I can't even do that because that won't work. What am I supposed to do? I bought a days of play ps4 & it's been the most unreliable console I think I've ever had. Im 27 now, I remember having a ps1 when I was a kid, & growing up Ive had every other PlayStation device released, console to handheld & back.

Sounds like a bad idea to me, the last thing any game needs is for a split player base. (it's precisely why franchises are moving away from season passes). Frankly, if anyone is keen to play games with keyboard and mouse, go buy a PC. As someone in a comment elsewhere said: MS have taken a Windows PC and turned it into a games console, and have now turned that games console into a PC. So your goal to not split a playerbase.... is to split a player base. Just brilliant. The applicability of cross play will depend on the game in question and as gears of war showed us needs to be tested instead of people blindly making assumptions. The main issue consoles are facing is pc is growing very quickly and is not slowing down (it has in fact surpassed the entire console market from what I understand). Microsoft is aware of this and thus have been positioning themselves to take advantage of it. Sony has not revealed what there plans are beyond maybe psnow, so time will tell how they intend to continue playstation in the future.",,Suntory_Times,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,PS4 Cross Play Beta,,,

I don’t think I’ve ever seen/played a prequel that worked particularly well as a stand-alone experience, or at least as an entry-point to a series. God of War: Ascension for example would be a terrible game to start the series with, because it talks about events that are uncovered/learned of in the first GoW, and expects you to know who Kratos is, how he became the Ghost of Sparta, who Ares/Zeus are, etc. My point is, you could only benefit from playing through Red Dead Redemption before playing the 2nd, even if it is a prequel, because like virtually every prequel in existence, it expects you to know who some of these characters are, and it will no doubt reference or foreshadow events that are going to happen in the first. Plus, like others have said in previous topics about this, if you ever intend on going back and playing the original, it’ll only feel that much more dated and clunky in comparison to this one. You can play it on the PS3, 360, XONE through backwards compatibility, or PS4 through PSNow, and it’s like $15-$20 for the GotY Edition with all of the DLC, so it’s not like it’s a hard game to get ahold of and play. I just don’t see why you wouldn’t wanna play it before playing the 2nd game.",,caboose84,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Also Google just revealed Project Stream, a platform to test their streaming technologies - and their first test before inevitably cancelling it and buying out a competitor that does it better is for video games.

 * Sony’s PlayStation Experience will not be held in North America for the first time since its launch in 2014. 
 * Sony Worldwide Studios Chairman Shawn Layden said the event was canceled due to a lack of major announcements. 
 * The PlayStation 4 remains the most popular video game console in the world, and Sony plans to increase communication with fans moving forward. 
Sony’s annual PlayStation Experience video game conference will not take place in 2018 due to a lack of new announcements, Sony Worldwide Studios Chairman Shawn Layden has confirmed.

In past years, PlayStation Experience has been the launching pad for Sony’s biggest reveals. But the PlayStation 4 has dominated the console market this year with major releases like “Marvel’s Spider-Man” and “God of War,” leaving Sony with just a few exclusive titles to promote going into 2019.

“We wouldn’t have enough to bring people all together in some location in North America to have that event,” Layden said during Sony’s promotional blogcast. “We don’t want to set expectations really high and not deliver on it. It was a hard decision, but we have determined that this year we will not hold PlayStation Experience.”

Layden said the company didn’t want to disappoint fans with a lack of meaningful news. Instead, Sony will focus on providing more frequent updates and communication to keep fans excited for the future of PlayStation.

During the blogcast, Layden said Sony is still preparing previously announced games, like “Days Gone” and “Dreams,” for release in 2019, but those didn’t warrant a full conference.  


Insomniac Games/Marvel


The current iteration of PlayStation Experience was launched in 2014 as a celebration of PlayStation’s 20th anniversary. Along with announcing new games, PlayStation Experience offered panel discussions with developers, hands-on demos, and dozens of exhibitors over the course of a weekend.

Layden said the original goal of the event was to gather fans and bring them closer to Sony’s new first party titles.


Sony


But even without the excitement of PlayStation Experience, PS4 owners can still look forward to exclusive games like “The Last of Us: Part II” and “Ghost of Tsushima.” Plus, “God of War” and “Spider-Man” both set sales records for the PlayStation 4 this year, and the console continues to sell better than Microsoft’s Xbox One or the newer Nintendo Switch.

Despite its sales advantage over the other consoles, Sony recently opened the doors to crossplay with other platforms. “Fortnite: Battle Royale” is the first game to allow PlayStation gamers to play with people on other consoles, but Sony has hinted that other games will soon be following suit.

Sony also rolled out full PS2 and PS4 game downloads for PlayStation Now subscribers in September, placing the service in direct competition with the Xbox Game Pass.

Has anyone here tried it out? To me, it looks like this could possibly be the future of gaming.Streaming a game in 4K hosted on dedicated servers meaning no game downloading required and all games saves and purchases are saved on the cloud. You can even purchase the latest games through steam and Uplay as they are supported. What are your thoughts on this? Could this one day do away with console and PC gaming do you think? This box is extremely powerful for such a little device and compared to a high end gaming PC, ps4 pro or Xbox one X it's dirt cheap! This will be a long post I have given my opinions on this on here before, but I'm not a fan of streaming gameplay. This whole ""Netflix of Video Games"" stuff is a load of nonsense. Watching tv on a stream and gaming on a stream are very different things. I recently tried PSNow, and although it was ok, it was well off being at the point where I would ever want it to be my main way to play games. The only thing streaming gameplay has that is better than what we are doing now is that it's instant..........that is literally all I can think of that is better. But people don't actually seem to mind that they have to download their games, so even this isn't anything special. Look at the reaction to Sony announcing that games on PSNow can be downloaded to your PS4, people are now much more interested in PSNow for this reason alone. Here are the major issues I have with it. It requires an almost perfect internet connection. Ok, you can get away with playing it on a decent connection, it doesn't need to be perfect to play on it, but if you want perfect gameplay streaming, then you need a perfect connection and it's something nobody has. For me, nothing but perfection is going to be enough. If I am going to be moving away from the way I am playing now, then you need to make my experience better or at least as good. If I'm suffering lag or latency issues at any point, then what is the point? How can that ever be acceptable? It may be fine for the casual gamer that is going to play the odd 10 minutes here and there, but for somebody like me that has many gaming sessions, it's just not good enough. Video quality, it looks poor on a stream. Just because it says HD or 4K, that doesn't mean it looks good. Every so often I am seeing a drop in quality and things get blocky. That has been a problem with videos or streaming online for as long as the internet has been around. Compression is a major problem, why would I choose crappy looking compressed video quality over the crisp clear image I have now? Quite simply, I'm not going to accept it, it's a deal breaker. I don't buy a nice monitor for average quality picture. We don't own the games. Geforce Now is better in this case because you can play your Steam and Uplay games, but how long will they have your game available for you to play? We are talking about every game here, it's highly likely they will remove your game at some point or won't ever have your game available to play anyway. Like I if it's not better than what I already have, then why would I bother with it? Mods. As a PC gamer, I love mods, they are great fun and have improved many games over the years and actually even fixed many issues that exist in games. Mods wouldn't be possible for a streaming service. Having that taken away would be another deal breaker for me. They like to make out that streaming is the future, but it's not a better future, not even close to it. It's worse, and I can't see how they could possibly fix the issues I have pointed out above. All good points. I wasn't trying to say the shield is the future, btw, just that it might be a hint of what is to come at some point in the future. At some point in the future I would assume issues with slow broadband speeds and latency will be a thing of the past as technology progresses. For me, personally, as a casual gamer I like the idea of a game being available instantly to play rather than having to wait for it to download. I understand totally what you're getting at in regards to ownership of the game. If you have bought it you should always be able to access it. With Steam as it is currently, I can purchase a game and download it to my PC to play it, but this Nvidia shield device allows you to stream your game in another room or even at your friends house etc without having to lug your massive PC around. I think that's pretty cool.",,bottleofbest,United Kingdom,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Thanks to services like NVIDIA GeForce Now and PlayStation Now, the gaming industry has been experimenting a lot with the act of streaming video games over an internet connection rather than running them locally on a console or PC. Now, the latest company to dip its toes in the streaming games market is Google.



On Monday, October 1, Google formally announced Project Stream — a new technology from the company that is designed to stream AAA video games to your computer using just an internet connection and web browser.

Per Google’s announcement post:

The technology and creativity behind these AAA video games is extraordinary—from incredible detail and life-like movement of the characters’ skin, clothing, and hair, to the massive scale of the world in which the game unfolds, down to every last blade of grass. Every pixel is powered by an array of real-time rendering technology, artistry, visual effects, animation, simulation, physics and dynamics. We’re inspired by the game creators who spend years crafting these amazing worlds, adventures and experiences, and we’re building technology that we hope will support and empower that creativity.

To kickstart Project Stream, Google’s looking for people in the U.S. to test drive the service with the opportunity to play Assassin’s Creed Oddysey for free starting October 5 and going through mid-January. All you need is an internet connection of 25Mbs or higher and a desktop or laptop with Google Chrome.

What’s the ultimate goal of Project Stream? While Google’s yet to say one way or another, it’s very possible that this will tie into reports from earlier this year of Google working on its own gaming console called “Yeti.” We already know that Yeti will have a focus on cloud-based streaming, so it only seems logical that Project Stream is our first introduction to that.

Google’s holding an event on October 9 to unveil the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, and should the company take some time to go into further detail about Project Stream and/or Yeti, we’ll be sure to let you know.

Where Sony has a service like PSNow that is kind of meh. But Xbox comes along and very aggressively pushes support on their own service with Gamepass. There was very little hype and no official support to PlayStations KB&M support; not to mention advertisement. Same scenario could be used with PS4 Pro and Xbox one X support. Xbox arguably went WAY harder into enhanced titles compared to Sony. I think it’s a safe bet that KB&M support will be a MUCH bigger deal on Xbox. Especially due to their already close ties on PC gaming.,,Carsickness,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,
