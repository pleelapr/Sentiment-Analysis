Well, Sony does use their own server blades for PSNow. Same as MS, Google and Amazon. What they don't have of their own are data centers. Sony co-locates (places their server blades at these centers). Thing is, MS, Google and Amazon also co-locate. They don't just use their own data centers for their cloud business. They use others' data centers. Ideally, you only set up a data center in key positions. For larger businesses this would be in hot spots of population and infrastructure. Less so in more out of the way regions. For smaller cloud businesses it makes sense for them to operate in those out of the way regions. So, larger business do co-locate at the smaller businesses' data center. Heck, the big cloud companies can and do co-locate at each others' data centers. Point being, needing to co-locate is not necessarily a disadvantage. One big advantage is if you need to scale up your cloud servers rapidly it is far easier to do this via co-locating than having to go to the extreme expense of setting up your own data center. MS, Google and Amazon having their own data centers is not necessarily a big win against Sony when (this is a key qualifier) it comes to game streaming. Because when it comes to a specific use of cloud computing - like delivering entertainment content - then one rule rules supreme. Content is king. Good example: Netflix. Netflix co-locates their servers. And yet despite Amazon being vastly bigger than Netflix, with Amazon having their own data centers it is Netflix that spanks Amazon when it comes to digital content streaming. Why? Because Netflix has a better strategy regarding content. Again, because content is king. Sony is in a very good position regarding this and they're not standing still. MS is trying to change their content strategy whereas Amazon and Google don't have anything at all yet. They don't have a brand of content like Sony has with PlayStation.",,ooombasa,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Solis posted... uptown710 posted... I don’t have a data cap either but your provider will throttle the s*** outta you if you start streaming games. Want proof? Tether your phone to your console and see how far you get playing a game. I’ll be surprised if it’s even playable. Definitely playable. I relied on smartphone tethering for quite some time for all of my home devices, including games and consoles, and it worked great. In fact the speeds I've gotten on my phone have been much better than the average home broadband connection in the US. Taken from howtogeek.com : “The most important thing holding back cloud gaming is internet speed. You need a fast, stable internet connection to take advantage of cloud gaming. Ideally, you’ll need a consistent 50 Mbps downstream speed, and that’s if you’re not sharing that speed with others. Having two people playing games at the same time, or having someone else streaming video in the other room, eats into that speed.” You must have the most wonderful provider in the world cause with sprint, I ideally max at about 30-31. Ideally. Ping is another big issue with this service. I avg about 35-40 on my connection and PSNow gives me lag because of my ping. I've gotten over 100mbps downstream on Verizon 4G, with pings as low as 30ms with 5ms jitter. Of course, it will be highly dependent on signal quality, tower load, etc. Edit: also, the bandwidth usage of online gaming are grossly overstated by most. Generally playing a game online won't use more than about 2mbps of total bandwidth. Even Netflix maxes out at around 30mbps of bandwidth for its highest quality stream, iirc. That’s playing a game. Streaming it is completely different. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/56knv8/how_much_bandwidth_does_playstation_now_use/#ampf=undefined These guys are pulling 100s of gigs a month. On games that are 4 years old. Throw in your day to day data usage and TV streaming. Your ISP will wither throttle the crap out of you are find a way to make you pay for it.

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== I am only in if it’s compatible with PS4 games and around $400. If it is, I am in. If not, I’m not.

Only microsoft does that because they use better specs. And look at how well it is going for them. The one time Sony trief to surpasd MS with hardware (ps3) the price tag skyrocketed and even if the hardware was marginally better it was a hassle for devs to squeeze the juice. i am going to love all the crying .when they say the price and there is no way it will cost 400 dollars .the only way it will be that price .if they build a ps4 pro slim and call it the ps5 oh and you want proof people will pay 500 dollars look at the ps4 500million one that just launched https://www.gamestop.com/ps4/consoles/playstation-4-pro-2tb-500-million-limited-edition-console-sold-out/166956,,djwagon,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== theunentitled said: ↑ gencid said: ↑ Dirty_Silhouette said: ↑ Backwards compat is my biggest hope. My PS3 is having issues and it makes me a bit nauseated thinking some games are stuck on it (that I don't want to rebuy). Click to expand... I would buy a PS3 Pro that runs on the PS4 OS in a heartbeat if such a system would exist. The PS2 BC PS3 is my favorite system of all time. theunentitled said: ↑ I wonder what's historically been the timeline from when they've announced they're working on a console to that console's release? I'd be surprised if it releases earlier than autumn 2020 or later than autumn 2021, but I'd still like to be able to look at history and get a more concrete idea. Click to expand... Historically we've known about upcoming PlayStation systems a couple of years in advance. Only PS4 was announced and released on the same year, which is why I think 2019 could be a possibility even though 2020 is far more likely. Also with PS4 Pro still at $399.99, I don't expect PS5 to be less than $499.99 on day 1. Click to expand... I expect them to aim for $399, and my hope to that end is releasing an SKU without a disc drive, rather than compromising on the chips. Then they can put out a traditional version at $499 to the people who want to use physical media for movies/games. I think I'd go with the latter version, but I'm not even 75% sure I would. I don't buy used, I don't really sell my games unless they suck, and most of the time when I watch movies it's through my Plex server, Netflix/Hulu/Filmstruck/HBO Now, or iTunes purchases. 15 years ago I was serious about DVD collecting (I had about 350...), but in the current age that's just wasting shelf space. Plus, the PS4 Pro being $399 in 2018, roughly 2 years after it launched, doesn't necessarily mean it'll be $399 in 2019, 2020, or 2021 whenever day 1 of the PS5 is.... Click to expand... PS4 may release as soon as 2019, but absolutely no later than Fall 2020 and if it is substantially better than PS4 Pro, there is no way that it will retail for less than $100 over the PS4 Pro. $399.99 is actually the bare minimum price that PS5 will retail on launch day and considering where the tech is today and what the pricing structure seems to be on home consoles, I am willing to bet on the $499.99 price on day 1.",,gencid,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

Free Backwards compat. is way ahead on Xbox. Upscaled to 4K and everything else improved. 2. 4K BR Playback is at least available on XB1S and XB1X 3. HDMI In 4. XBox Game Pass is cheaper and better than PSNow (point of contention, I know but when you can get day and date exclusives on it, it's pretty compelling). Games are the number 1 factor for most people and Sony's library far outshines Xbox's. Only Nintendo can potentially make a case otherwise. All of those things u listed will likely be in next gen consoles where things like 4k will truly be fleshed out. Hardware wise no one is denying that the one X is a good value proposition (best in fact) but there are others like me who also have gaming PCs, media centre PCs etc that can play most Microsoft games. In the end, I believe it should come down to games and whichever ones your friends and family play on. Owning more than one console also helps if you can afford time and money wise. ====================::==================== I wonder how this works with STACK... or if there'll be any point.",,mumbles,Canada,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,3 Months of Free Netflix for PlayStation Plus Members [YMMV] - Page 5,,,

I wouldn't be surprised to see 4K30 and 1080p60 offered as options. > 4K Blu-Ray Player (This also should have come native to the PS4 Pro) Its a mystery as to why a UHD player is absent on the Pro as is. Sony profit margins would have been fine taking a loss of a few dollars initially to include on. > Expand on crossplay capabilities. (Might not be wishful thinking very soon if the tests with Fortnite and Fallout 76 go well) Not really in their financial interests to expand or even have crossplay. Crossplay, from a business perspective, only helps those market products who are in second or third place, as those players now have people to play with vs an empty lobby. > Two different possible solutions to backwards compatibility - Solution One Simply add a second disc slot designed for Backwards Compatibility. Solution Two Make all Playstation NOW! games downloadable digitally Your Solution One is impossible. Adding a second BD drive isn't going to miraculously add the hardware or APIs necessary to play those older games. It would just increase the cost and bulk of the console. Solution Two has some more viability, but likely only for PS1,2,&3 games. It'd be easier to stream those games, as their lower sizes, visuals, etc, would be more easily served over limited bandwidth. Backwards capability for the PS4 hardware should be technically easy to implement, if the future PS5 builds on the GNM/GNMX APIs, expanding them with new feature sets while still supporting the older. Games on the PC have been doing this for decades now, where a new version of DirectX, OpenGL, or some other API doesn't immediately render the prior versions obsolete as the newer versions contain all the same instructions. Unlike the launch model fat PS3s, which had the full PS2 hardware contained, there'd be no need to include the full PS4 hardware inside a PS5. Just support the same APIs. I hope they do have BC with the PS4 library though, it'd be an easy way to sell several million more consoles at launch than they otherwise would. With the awesome exclusives the PS4 has had, I would be less inclined to buy a PS5 if my PS4 library was unplayable on it. > Console customization - can sell branded Sony parts or license 3rd parties I've always found the console customizations somewhat odd. I bought a matte black PS4 Pro back in 2017, does Sony really expect me to cough up another 400 USD for a RDR2 or Uncharted color scheme on the exact same console? Granted, they may be targeting new buyers, but I don't see much appeal if you're one of the 80M+ existing PS4 customers.",,StargateGuy,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The following excerpts are from Ars Technica: Quote: A new service from Microsoft called Project Xcloud is on the way, and it will stream Xbox games, not just to consoles and PCs , but to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Microsoft shared new information about its plans in a blog post and a talking-heads YouTube video . Microsoft is testing the service right now. Multiple control methods will be offered on mobile phones and tablets... Games shown in early footage of the service include Sea of Thieves and entries in the Gears of War and Halo series. However, Xcloud will not be limited to first-party titles; the plan is to implement the service in such a way that no additional work will be required to support it from third-party developers. Microsoft hopes to achieve this in part by running the games on what amounts to native Xbox hardware in its data centers . ""We've architected a new customizable blade that can host the component parts of multiple Xbox One consoles ,"" Microsoft wrote in its announcement. "" We will scale those custom blades in datacenters across Azure regions over time ."" They also mention they intend to utilise 5G capabilities even though the technology is in it's infancy, as well as standard broadband and 4G technologies. Quote: The goal is to make game streaming possible not just on broadband Internet in homes or upcoming 5G networks but on today's 4G networks as well —that's key, since many regions won't see 5G for a while, and some of the non-core users Microsoft is trying to reach rely exclusively on mobile for Internet access. In their video they mentioned that they have it running small-scale and in-house but it's still some time away from general use. All we know is 2019. Quote: The public trial for Project Xcloud will begin sometime in 2019 . My Thoughts: The Xbox team are fully utilising the position they're in, they have the financial and technological support of Microsoft and are taking advantage of the Azure cloud. It's obviously a big advantage for them over their competitors but also it will be interesting to see now Google and Microsoft competing for Cloud game-streaming dominance and it makes me wonder whether or not Sony are paying attention... I suggest watching the video, they details the custom blades they've designed for their data centres, fascinating stuff and it's definitely the way of the future and no one can deny that.

Personally I only play a few of the big games a year, but if the barriers to entry were removed I'd be more inclined to try more games at the click of a button. I think the same would hold true for others and you'd see a boon to games otherwise ignored. The problem with that argument is that you ""trying more games at the click of a button"" is only really a positive for the service provider, individual content vendors on the service have far less to gain from that unless they have their own service model and economy. I mean, if you (as a developer) are only in it for the gratitude of the gaming public, why not just give away your game for free in the first place? If not, and want to see some sort of return on what is in all probability a multi-year venture, (and this is of course virtually everybody) then you need to think about what sort of revenue you are going to make, how you are going to make it, and over what time-frame.

Historically we've known about upcoming PlayStation systems a couple of years in advance. Only PS4 was announced and released on the same year, which is why I think 2019 could be a possibility even though 2020 is far more likely. Also with PS4 Pro still at $399.99, I don't expect PS5 to be less than $499.99 on day 1. Click to expand... I expect them to aim for $399, and my hope to that end is releasing an SKU without a disc drive, rather than compromising on the chips. Then they can put out a traditional version at $499 to the people who want to use physical media for movies/games. I think I'd go with the latter version, but I'm not even 75% sure I would. I don't buy used, I don't really sell my games unless they suck, and most of the time when I watch movies it's through my Plex server, Netflix/Hulu/Filmstruck/HBO Now, or iTunes purchases. 15 years ago I was serious about DVD collecting (I had about 350...), but in the current age that's just wasting shelf space. Plus, the PS4 Pro being $399 in 2018, roughly 2 years after it launched, doesn't necessarily mean it'll be $399 in 2019, 2020, or 2021 whenever day 1 of the PS5 is....",,theunentitled,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

178855479007,10/8/2018,http://reuters-com-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/178855479007,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is testing a new game streaming service called Project xCloud that is designed to work across PCs, consoles and mobile devices, the company said on Monday.

Public trials for Project xCloud would begin in 2019, Microsoft said.

“We are testing Project xCloud today. The test runs on devices (mobile phones, tablets) paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller through Bluetooth, and it is also playable using touch input,” Kareem Choudhry, corporate vice president, gaming cloud, said in a blog post.

The service will compete with Google’s “Project Stream”, a game streaming service that is being tested by the Alphabet Inc unit in partnership with game publisher Ubisoft.

Microsoft’s xCloud will also face competition from other popular streaming services including Nvidia’s GeForce Now and Sony’s PlayStation Now among others.

I'm not going to talk about Encoding because that's a primarily server side power problem that is solvable if you just put more money into it and code more efficiently. Latency is the thing that is going to matter. It's what will affect adoption rate, user experience, playability, everything. What is latency? Well it's essentially the time it takes a server to communicate to you, and you to communicate back to the server. In real terms, it's how responsive your experience is. Input lag, display lag, reaction opportunity these things are all controlled by latency. So what controls latency? In short, how close you are to the server physically. Base latency of controller to console input is measures in milliseconds, and is generally low. ~7ms for the Xbox One controller. That's not something you can feel. It's not anything that will ever affect how well you perform in a game. So what if that signal had to travel to a server and back to work? Well that depends on your latency to the server. Your ""ping"" to use terminology most competitive games use. A good example of this is my ""ping"" to the nearest server for League of Legends is ~20ms. That means there is about a 20ms delay on what i do, and when it happens according to the server. When other players will see it happen will depend on their latency. So why is all this important? Well if you're latency to an Xcloud server is 300+ms you're going to be hitting buttons and waiting, a small amount of time, to see that action occur. In some games this is ok, in others it's not. So how is MS dealing with this? Well the Azure platform is unique in that it's ubiquitous. There are thousands of Azure servers all over the world. It also uses a unique data pooling method to deal with this. Essentially when you boot up a game on Xcloud what's going to happen is it's going to find the nearest server to you, copy all the data for that game that you would need to that server temporarily so that you always get the best connection you can get. And since MS has Azure servers almost everywhere generally people's experience should be tolerable. I doubt we'll ever be playing competitive COD across Xcloud but it should be fine for most people. I say this having used both PlayStation Now, and Geforce's gamestreaming and having had poor experiences.",,SpartanG01,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

178858327522,10/8/2018,http://stayprimed.tumblr.com/post/178858327522,"* Project xCloud is a new video game streaming service capable of bringing high-end Xbox games to a range of devices, including smartphones and computers. 
 * The online service will stream the game from remote cloud servers to the user’s device, removing the need for high-powered consoles or gaming computers. 
 * Project xCloud doesn’t have a release date yet, but it will likely launch with new Xbox devices designed specifically for streaming. 
Microsoft has officially announced Project xCloud, a new video game streaming service that could bring the next generation of video games to mobile devices around the world.

Backed by the company’s Azure Cloud computing service, Project xCloud aims to remove the need for expensive home consoles or gaming PCs to play high-quality video games.

Based on the announcement, Project xCloud would allow players to stream some of Microsoft’s most well-known titles including “Halo,” “Gears of War,” “Forza” and “Minecraft.” Microsoft said the thousands of developers currently working on Xbox titles will be able to use Project xCloud as well.

The service supports Xbox One controllers via Bluetooth but also allows touchscreen controls on tablets and smartphones. A handy peripheral that clips a smartphone on top of an Xbox Controller can create a portable setup for high-end gaming. In a statement attached to the Project xCloud announcement, Microsoft said Project xCloud will be functional on 4G and 5G mobile data networks.

Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s executive vice president of gaming, teased the new streaming service at E3 in June 2018. In an interview with Business Insider after Microsoft’s keynote speech, Spencer said the company wants to reach gamers on whatever platform they choose to play on. Microsoft’s Azure Cloud service is available in 140 countries and Project xCloud could greatly reduce the technological barrier of entry for gaming.



“There are 2 billion people who play video games on the planet today. We’re not going to sell 2 billion consoles,” Spencer said.

For now, it’s not clear whether Xbox owners will be able to carry their games and subscriptions over to Project xCloud, but Microsoft says developers will be able to stream their new games through Project xCloud with no additional effort.

As Xbox One sales lag behind those of the PlayStation 4, Microsoft has shown a continued interest in offering subscription services like the Xbox Game Pass and Xbox All Access to its users.



Microsoft isn’t the only company interested in streaming video games either. Google announced its own “Project Stream” last week, with the goal of bringing blockbuster video games straight to the Google Chrome browser. The Project Stream beta test will include just one game, Ubisoft’s recently released “Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey.” Sony, Microsoft’s primary competitor in the console gaming market, has its own streaming service in PlayStation Now.  PlayStation Now was once available on smart TVs and handheld devices but is currently limited to computers and the PlayStation 4 console. PC gaming company Nvidia unveiled their own streaming service in 2015, called GeForce Now, but the service remains in open beta after testing multiple subscription models. 

Project xCloud doesn’t have a release date yet, but Microsoft is planning a public trial for 2019. Rumors suggest that Microsoft will launch one or two new Xbox devices in 2020 to make use of Project xCloud’s streaming capabilities.

Can you show me where it says they are working on PS2 and PS1 BC support? Thank you so much for your help. Your original claim was that Sony ""continues to use their blemished PS3 era as an excuse not to offer BC anymore"" in which I refuted that claim. Now, you pivoted the conversation into something else because your argument got refuted and could not make an adequate counterargument. What's more is that you don't seem to understand what BC is. Backwards compatibility is where legacy software can be run on current hardware. PS1 and PS2 downloads through PSNow would fit that description because the legacy software (PS1 and PS2 titles) will be downloaded to the PS4/PS5 and run from the PS4/PS5 hardware. We have already seen select PS2 titles available for download on the service. Now, it's up to Sony to grow that list. The one issue with BC is not so hardware related, but the logistics of it, namely licensing. Even Microsoft runs into these problems with their OG XB/360 BC initiative.

If Sony refuses to join this game streaming route, Sony probably will be my most respected company. I think game streaming will have it's market, but won't be able to dominate. No internet can't play, and if my internet having routing issue to the game server also can't play, i can imagine how piss off i would be.[/quote] That is only true if it happens now just as if all of sudden games were only available digitally 5 years ago. Its not something that is gonna change from one day to another and in fact it all depends if it takes off or not. Consoles as I say aren't going anywhere for the time being but as much as we are against it we all have to face reality. The reality is that we belong to a small amount of gamers this days as those ""2 billion"" casual gamers and many other ones outnumber us by far. The reality is that a lot of consoles and game sales are from casual gamers and not from the hardcore anymore. Because of that the whole industry is shifting to that direction as there is tons of cash to be made. Look at games like PUBG, Fornite, Minecraft, Call of Duty and many others. We all agree that games such as God of War, Uncharted, Horizon Zero dawn, Forza Horizon 4, Gears, Monster Hunter World and many others are far better than those games but reality says otherwise as those games outnumber by far all those titles combined. [B]""If Sony refuses to join this game streaming route, Sony probably will be my most respected company.""[/B] Sony is actually the company that tried first this generation or are you forgetting about PSNow? that service hasn't been a success for Sony because they lack the infrastructure to pull this off properly. There are only 3 big players in this world capable of pulling that off and those are Google, Amazon and Microsoft and all the 3 are working on streaming services. As I say streaming is optional and is going to stay like that for a very long period of time i believe. Why is streaming that important? many countries around the globe have excellent internet connection and providing such a option is perfect for their needs. For instance [USER=100781]Thanakil[/USER] spent 400 bucks i guess for a PS4 Pro just to play Red Dead Redemption 2 a game that sadly isn't on PC. Imagine if he had the type of mobile connection i have with up to 160mbits and unlimited? he may not agree now but i bet he would at least consider to use such a service and play the game on PC instead by streaming it if it works well and save money. Right now it sounds bad for us and in reality it has many downsides too but we shouldn't forget that we purchase digital games nowdays and no matter what we don't have any type of ownership on those games except the permanent use as long as the service they are tied on is available. Streaming isn't any different you just have the freedom to choose anytime where to play your games.",,@ruantec,,,,Negative,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,

Free Backwards compat. is way ahead on Xbox. Upscaled to 4K and everything else improved. 2. 4K BR Playback is at least available on XB1S and XB1X 3. HDMI In 4. XBox Game Pass is cheaper and better than PSNow (point of contention, I know but when you can get day and date exclusives on it, it's pretty compelling). Games are the number 1 factor for most people and Sony's library far outshines Xbox's. Only Nintendo can potentially make a case otherwise. All of those things u listed will likely be in next gen consoles where things like 4k will truly be fleshed out. Hardware wise no one is denying that the one X is a good value proposition (best in fact) but there are others like me who also have gaming PCs, media centre PCs etc that can play most Microsoft games. In the end, I believe it should come down to games and whichever ones your friends and family play on. Owning more than one console also helps if you can afford time and money wise. ====================::==================== u can also rinse and repeat 30 free netflix trials! not sure if they only allow one CC# per signups, ymmv...best to have alot of low balance prepaid ccs! *SIG: OptiPlex™ 790 i5-2400 @3.1ghz 12gb DDR3 ram win10pro w/radeon rx460 rogers 500u @$24.99 using D-Link DIR-890L AC3200",,mikka2017,Canada,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,3 Months of Free Netflix for PlayStation Plus Members [YMMV] - Page 5,,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5?

Microsofts entire business model has always been to have their services on every platform under the sun. Nintendo already allows Xbox Live on the Switch for Minecraft as long as it doesn't cut into their revenue. In fact this only benefits Nintendo 1. They basically get a free paycheck via their cut of the revenue 2. It would cost them nothing as Microsoft would handle all of the backend wor 3. It would drive Switch sales. Imagine being able to play Ori, or Gears, or Fable on the Switch with next to no latency and at good quality Basically with the xCloud Nintendo has everything to gain and nothing to lose. As long as you don't have to pay for Live on the Switch than I'm fairly sure Nintendo would be down for it Sony on the other hand is another story....they didn't even want EA Access on their platform. king_madden posted... No this isnt a response to switch, its expected to come out next year, or not long after, so chances are this has been in the plans for a while, not something they started last year Much more likely a response to psnow Definitely not, this was in planning way back before 2012..I remember they were playing Halo 4 on a Windows phone >king_madden posted... Someone please tell me how this is influenced by switch in any way, while MS direct competitor is the one who already has a service like this?

Win/win for both companies...for Microsoft it allows their games and service be available on a true portable console (an area they lack)...for Nintendo it offers a way to get AAA multiplats on a system that would otherwise never have them. Microsoft today announced their Project Xcloud which will start next year (and pave the way for their new Xbox streaming hardware to make it even better) The future of gaming is a world where you are empowered to play the games you want, with the people you want, whenever you want, wherever you are, and on any device of your choosing. Our vision for the evolution of gaming is similar to music and movies — entertainment should be available on demand and accessible from any screen. Today, I’m excited to share with you one of our key projects that will take us on an accelerated journey to that future world: Project xCloud. Today, the games you play are very much dictated by the device you are using. Project xCloud’s state-of-the-art global game-streaming technology will offer you the freedom to play on the device you want without being locked to a particular device, empowering YOU, the gamers, to be at the center of your gaming experience.

Developers of the more than 3,000 games available on Xbox One today, and those building the thousands that are coming in the future, will be able to deploy and dramatically scale access to their games across all devices on Project xCloud with no additional work. Click to expand... Scaling and building out Project xCloud is a multi-year journey for us. We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations. Our focus is on delivering an amazing added experience to existing Xbox players and on empowering developers to scale to hundreds of millions of new players across devices. Our goal with Project xCloud is to deliver a quality experience for all gamers on all devices that’s consistent with the speed and high-fidelity gamers experience and expect on their PCs and consoles Click to expand... Developers and researchers at Microsoft Research are creating ways to combat latency through advances in networking topology, and video encoding and decoding. Project xCloud will have the capability to make game streaming possible on 4G networks and will dynamically scale to push against the outer limits of what’s possible on 5G networks as they roll out globally. Currently, the test experience is running at 10 megabits per second. Our goal is to deliver high-quality experiences at the lowest possible bitrate that work across the widest possible networks, taking into consideration the uniqueness of every device and network Click to expand...

If it is better than something like Playstation Now was, that would be alright. I tried that out twice, and was never that impressed. My internet is respectable, so I doubt that was the issue. i'll be curious to see where this goes. Click to expand... The beta gamers on Nvidia streaming and Google’s project Streaming already have glowing reviews on it..and I can only imagine Microsoft’s version will be even better since they have put so much development time and money into this (It’s all better than psnow...while Sony was forward thinking in offering such a service first, they suffer from not investing in the tech at all, and being narrow in the service they offer. I like to think of it as like James Cameron being able to show people how awesome 3D movies can be...but unfortunately the glut of mediocre 3D conversion movies since have made people think 3D sucks/unnecessary. PsNow is the mediocre version of this tech, that is unfortunately causing corner gamers to shrug their shoulders at the idea) The latency and input lag is already down to the point where it doesn’t really matter. Microsoft will be offering a ~$100 box with their next gen stuff that has hardware in it to do half the work and make latency/input lag close to zero for those who really are sensitive to it. But honestly, gamers who game on consoles and hdtv’s have already conditioned themselves to put up with input lag (compared to pc/monitor gaming). It’s all relative. The majority of mainstream gamers will see streaming as the better option. Any drawbacks that core/hardcore see it streaming...really won’t matter. Streaming games at top of the line hardware quality on cheap old hardware is better than spending $400-$500 for less input lag...hardware that will eventually get old. With streaming, the games upgrade on the servers and you don’t have to upgrade hardware at home (or on the go) I mean, you tell the casual mainstream gamer all they have to do is pay $100 for the Xbox streaming box in order to play cyberpunk2077 at full ultra quality? As well as all other games? And never have to worry about upgrading? It will be the best option for most",,phantomnx,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Rumor - Project Xcloud announced today is how the Microsoft/Nintendo collaboration will be possible,,,

They shouldn't update what is proven to work well and even when they more radically updated it for PS4, I still think they should have left the analog sticks alone. PSX - a more ergonomic SNES controller with better D-Pad and dual bumpers Dual Shock - added twin stick, rumble and enabler button once Nintendo proved that the stick works better than D-Pad for 3D games and rumble was a great controller innovation Dual Shock 2 - made all buttons pressure sensitive which was essentially controller sex if it wasn't for the cord that kept the controller still tethered to the console Sixaxis - made Dual Shock 2 wireless, added 3 dimensional motion controls, turned the lower bumpers into trigger buttons (thanks a lot MS) but removed rumble due to lawsuit Dual Shock 3 - added rumble back to Sixaxis after it settled the lawsuit and if it weren't for the lower bumpers (triggers), it would have been potentially the best controller of all time Dual Shock 4 - adjusted controller ergonomics, swapped the perfect convex analog sticks with terrible concave ones, fixed the triggers, added touch pad thanks to the WiiU, had LEDs on the controller as to not give up unattractive motion controls which ate the controller battery life and renamed Start and Select menu buttons to Options and Share. Dual Shock 4 Pro - fixed the reliability of the analog sticks even though they are still worse than Dual Shock 3 and made part of the touch pad see-through for a sexier look So I guess you were mostly right about Sony not drastically changing their controller until PS4, but considering that the change brought significant downgrades in addition to some not very significant upgrades, I would actually rather them not change the controllers again and just improve on past screw ups which in 2018 would mean to change the sticks back to convex, minimize the real estate that a mostly useless touch pad takes, and either remove the LED lights from the controller or have an option to turn them ON or OFF, with the default option being OFF. Click to expand... I think the Led is there for vr so they can’t remove it. Basically yeah just make improvements. Battery life and the triggers. My triggers squeak when I press them. They’re so cheaply made Click to expand... Well, then they should just let people turn them OFF. If this is too hard to do through the OS, I will be fine with them putting a physical tiny button next to them to manually turn them off. I haven't had any issues with the triggers, though I think the squeaking noise is not exclusive to DS4.

178881119465,10/9/2018,http://the-telegraph-fin-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/178881119465,"Microsoft has announced Project xCloud, a ‘state-of-the-art’ streaming service that is aiming to bring console quality video games to devices such as mobile and tablet.

The streaming service will start public trials in 2019 and is looking to allow gamers to stream any Xbox One game, such as Halo or Forza Horizon, on any device, with developers able to ‘deploy and dramatically scale access to their games with no additional work.’

Microsoft’s intention of building a cloud-streaming service was revealed at the E3 2018 conference in June, in which Xbox boss Phil Spencer announced that Microsoft’s engineers were working on a solution to bring Xbox games to mobile.

In an announcement video, Microsoft said that the technology is up and running, using the company’s Azure cloud computing service. Microsoft demonstrated Forza Horizon running on a mobile device, controlled with an Xbox controller connected by Bluetooth, and Halo running on a tablet using touchscreen input.

In an effort to combat the latency possible in any kind of streaming, which would be particularly crippling for video games, Microsoft said that they are building custom ‘blades’ using the component parts from an Xbox One S console to slot into their cloud datacenters.

“Cloud game-streaming is a multi-faceted, complex challenge,” said Microsoft’s Kareem Choudhry in a blog post. “Unlike other forms of digital entertainment, games are interactive experiences that dynamically change based on player input. Delivering a high-quality experience across a variety of devices must account for different obstacles, such as low-latency video streamed remotely, and support a large, multi-user network.“

Microsoft said that xCloud is capable of running on a 4G network and the company will look to improve the service for 5G users as the improved network becomes more readily available.

Microsoft has 54 data-centers in Azure regions around the world, with the service available in 140 countries, which Microsoft believes will give it a strong base to roll out its game-streaming service.

The announcement for xCloud comes following the news that Google is trialling its own game-streaming service, Project Stream, which is running a limited test in the United States allowing users to play Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Odyssey directly in Google Chrome browsers.
Halo was used in the demo, played with touch-screen controls on a tablet 
Sony Playstation, the main rival for Xbox in the console gaming market, already has a streaming service in the form of PlayStation Now. But after discontinuing the service on Sony Bravia TVs, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3, users of the subscription based service can only stream games to a PC or their PlayStation 4 console rather than mobile devices.

Microsoft did not reveal any details on pricing plans or how the service might work for existing Xbox One owners. But it was at pains to say it was committed to its flagship console and that gaming on a native console would still be ‘the best place to play.’

Instead, Microsoft is targeting xCloud at gamers less likely to buy a high-end console as the tech giant continues its attempt to take the ‘Xbox’ brand beyond just the console market.

Analysts believe that console gaming would not be under threat from cloud-based gaming in the immediate future, particularly after Microsoft committed to building the next generation of Xbox consoles at this year’s E3, but that the xCloud service could roll out by the end of next year.

“Microsoft continues to work on a next-gen console which will supersede the Xbox One X and it has been clear that it believes that cloud gaming will be an incremental opportunity for Xbox for the foreseeable future,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of gaming at analyst firm IHS Markit. “What is interesting is that xCloud will initially be built using Xbox One S hardware. Although Microsoft states that the infrastructure will be easily updated in the future, this suggests that a commercial service will launch sooner rather than later and quite likely before the end of 2019.”",,the-telegraph-fin-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Xbox One games headed to mobile as Microsoft announce xCloud streaming service,Post,,

178863669811,10/8/2018,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/178863669811,"Numerous game companies believe that streaming technology is the future. Now, Microsoft has announced its own approach to streaming video games: Project xCloud. The project aims to bring console-quality games to PC, consoles, and smart phone devices, and it will be rolling out public trials starting in 2019.

As detailed in the announcement, players will be able to use an Xbox One controller connected to supported devices, and a small attachment connects the controller to a smart phone for portable gaming. If you don’t have an Xbox One controller, touch controls are also available.

The service uses Microsoft’s Azure as a backbone to set up new datacenters, with customized hardware that uses the parts of multiple Xbox One consoles. Azure has datacenters in 140 countries, so Microsoft feels it is already in a strong position to roll out the service wide-scale. It’s also developing ways to combat latency, with current tests running at 10 megabits per second. The ultimate goal is to make streaming available on 4G networks.

Similarly, last week Google announced its own Project Stream, using Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to issue a technical test. PlayStation Now, meanwhile, has offered streaming games for quite a while, but recently began offering the option of downloading instead.

No internet can't play, and if my internet having routing issue to the game server also can't play, i can imagine how piss off i would be.[/quote] That is only true if it happens now just as if all of sudden games were only available digitally 5 years ago. Its not something that is gonna change from one day to another and in fact it all depends if it takes off or not. Consoles as I say aren't going anywhere for the time being but as much as we are against it we all have to face reality. The reality is that we belong to a small amount of gamers this days as those ""2 billion"" casual gamers and many other ones outnumber us by far. The reality is that a lot of consoles and game sales are from casual gamers and not from the hardcore anymore. Because of that the whole industry is shifting to that direction as there is tons of cash to be made. Look at games like PUBG, Fornite, Minecraft, Call of Duty and many others. We all agree that games such as God of War, Uncharted, Horizon Zero dawn, Forza Horizon 4, Gears, Monster Hunter World and many others are far better than those games but reality says otherwise as those game outnumber by far all those titles combined. [B]""If Sony refuses to join this game streaming route, Sony probably will be my most respected company.""[/B] Sony is actually the company that tried first this generation or are you forgetting about PSNow? that service hasn't been a success for Sony because they lack the infrastructure to pull this off properly. There are only 3 big players in this world capable of pulling that off and those are Google, Amazon and Microsoft and all the 3 are working on streaming services. As I say streaming is optional and is going to stay like that for a very long period of time i believe. Why is streaming that important? many countries around the globe have excellent internet connection and providing such a option is perfect for their needs. For instance @[USER=100781]Thanakil[/USER] spent 400 bucks i guess for a PS4 Pro just to play Red Dead Redemption 2 a game that sadly isn't on PC. Imagine if he had the type of mobile connection i have with up to 160mbits and unlimited? he may not agree now but i bet he would at least consider to use such a service and play the game on PC instead by streaming it if it works well and save money. Right now it sounds bad for us and in reality it has many downsides too but we shouldn't forget that we purchase digital games nowdays and no matter what we don't have any type of ownership on those games except the permanent use as long as the service they are tied on is available.

About Project xCloud Scaling and building out Project xCloud is a multi-year journey for us. We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations. Our focus is on delivering an amazing added experience to existing Xbox players and on empowering developers to scale to hundreds of millions of new players across devices. Our goal with Project xCloud is to deliver a quality experience for all gamers on all devices that’s consistent with the speed and high-fidelity gamers experience and expect on their PCs and consoles. Full Article: Official blog We knew they had this in the pipework since they announced it on stage at E3 earlier this year but this was sooner than I expected them to be announcing it, Could be with Google getting their plans out in the open Microsoft also wanted people taking note of their future streaming service.

It's not my fault Sony mismanaged the PS3 so poorly and had to do whatever it took to stop the bleeding. The PS4 has shown Sony still does not want to offer PS1 and PS2 BC either so all the arguments about how difficult it is for the PS3 games show just how little they care about it.

You've completely ignored the fact that _streaming would have to completely eclipse traditional consoles/PC_, which is a big stretch right now. Microsoft's video for their game streaming service talks about how this is a secondary setup and that consoles/PC are still the ""premium"" target. That may change, but saying so now is pure speculation in the early days of a ""new"" technology. Google might be another story, but they've never had a ""premium"" system before anyway. #2 - Pure speculation, and if there are multiple streaming services then competition should keep prices stable. If there was only one company with a realistic chance with streaming tech I _might_ agree, but you're speculating with no basis. The only examples of successful services like this in the game industry are game pass and PSNow, which are too new to tell. #3 still doesn't allow trading digital games, it allows selling keys that haven't been used. That secondary market would not exist with streaming, but you also aren't paying as much _for a single game_. 4. Again, this assumes streaming will eclipse the traditional market, of which there is no indication. > there is a psychological aspect to this you dont seem to be understanding. once you are paying a subscription already, you are more likely to spend more on microtransactions. someone who doesnt spend any on microtransactions in destiny or overwatch will once they are paying a subscription to play them. I do very much understand this, but is it a reason to outright ignore a technology that could be a very good thing? Maybe _you_ personally don't need streaming right now (and frankly I don't either), but that doesn't mean others won't, and it might lead to other interesting future developments. Why is wild speculation a reason to just give up and not try _because maybe there's a chance that things might go poorly for the consumer?_ Where is the line drawn for what we should and shouldn't try? > overall you and other people in this thread seem to be convinced that streaming will coexist with regular purchasing, and this is 100% not going to be the case. either streaming will die hopefully, or you will have to pay for streaming and regular purchases will cease to exist To reiterate - you are throwing out wild speculation without any basis whatsoever.

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5?

Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== gencid said: ↑ theunentitled said: ↑ gencid said: ↑ I would buy a PS3 Pro that runs on the PS4 OS in a heartbeat if such a system would exist. The PS2 BC PS3 is my favorite system of all time. Historically we've known about upcoming PlayStation systems a couple of years in advance. Only PS4 was announced and released on the same year, which is why I think 2019 could be a possibility even though 2020 is far more likely. Also with PS4 Pro still at $399.99, I don't expect PS5 to be less than $499.99 on day 1. Click to expand... I expect them to aim for $399, and my hope to that end is releasing an SKU without a disc drive, rather than compromising on the chips. Then they can put out a traditional version at $499 to the people who want to use physical media for movies/games. I think I'd go with the latter version, but I'm not even 75% sure I would. I don't buy used, I don't really sell my games unless they suck, and most of the time when I watch movies it's through my Plex server, Netflix/Hulu/Filmstruck/HBO Now, or iTunes purchases. 15 years ago I was serious about DVD collecting (I had about 350...), but in the current age that's just wasting shelf space. Plus, the PS4 Pro being $399 in 2018, roughly 2 years after it launched, doesn't necessarily mean it'll be $399 in 2019, 2020, or 2021 whenever day 1 of the PS5 is.... Click to expand... PS4 may release as soon as 2019, but absolutely no later than Fall 2020 and if it is substantially better than PS4 Pro, there is no way that it will retail for less than $100 over the PS4 Pro. $399.99 is actually the bare minimum price that PS5 will retail on launch day and considering where the tech is today and what the pricing structure seems to be on home consoles, I am willing to bet on the $499.99 price on day 1. Click to expand... I'd definitely take that bet. But like I said it's not out of the question that there'd be a $499 PS5 at launch...the issue is whether there would be multiple SKUs. I think they'll remember quite clearly the cheers they got back in 2013 announcing the $399 PS4 vs the $499 Xbox One. I'd say it's likely that if tech is too expensive for a discless PS5 to be viable at $399 at the specs they're targeting, they'll push the release back until component prices decrease enough to make it viable rather than risk releasing one lone option at $499.",,theunentitled,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

I'm not sure if ""showing respect"" is the right descriptor here. Sony as a business does what it needs to gain as many customers as it can, and to get those customers to spend as much as they can. Seeing the PS4 sell as well as it has this gen, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they've done a good job. At this point. Sony is likely in a weird place. They've got enough market share where they now would likely see greatly diminished returns on any features or studios they add. They're at the point where there isn't many consumers left to attract. Yeah, there are millions, but developing new features, and aquiring studios won't pay off for them like it could for MS. MS still have tens upon tens upon tens of millions of potential consumers out there. They can spend away on features, and dev studios, and it may pay off in the future. The overall first party issue is a bit more complicated, and complex. Your points are valid though, and I believe will become an issue next gen possibly. Like you stated, Sony have closed several studios, and opened only a couple. That's not something to inherently worry about though. I think the bigger issue is with the studios they have. If you look at how good the studios they have are, I think many of them are quite overrated. Guerrilla Games. Their portfolio consisted of several Killzone games that weren't very impressive. Kinda the same with Sony Santa Monica the last few years. These are now considered top tier devs because of HZD, and GoW. The problem I have, is that both of them are getting tons of help from other devs. Mainly ND. Almost all of Sony's first party devs are sharing engine, toolsets, assets, etc... with one another. That is great to an extent. Too much sharing, and all their games begin to look and feel alike. I believe Sony's studios have crossed that line. They are sharing too much. A R* game has a distinct 'feel' to it. A Dice game does as well. Same goes for most developers. We're beginning to see these distinct lines blurred with Sony's studios. We're already beginning to see comments thrown around, about 3rd person cinematic, and 'movie games'. There's a bit of hyperbole in much of it, but the root of it is based on some truth. At some point, if it continues, it may become a big problem as all of Sony's studios will become stuck in the same rut, because they will all be clones of one another. MS has made several strides this gen, bit I feel that their brand still lacks awareness. I still see far more PS4 Comercials than I do for Xbox. MS should market their products more. As far as the Xbox itself goes... MS has responded to all issues this gen. It takes time, but theyve done it. •PS4 was more powerful. °MS responded. •PS4 had the advanced DS4. °MS responded. •PS4 allowed used games. °MS responded, and included bc. •PS4 has streaming with PSNow. *It looks as though MS is responding. •PS4 has superior first party. *It looks as though MS is responding. It seems that any strength that Playstation has, MS is quick to counter and exceed it. If trends continue, next gen should be something interesting.",,Foxbat,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Over 500,? You truly believe they will make the same mistake ad with the ps3? You're delusional. yes .look at what miscosoft sold a unlt better then some ps4 pro.only way i can see it being lower is 75% of what will be in the top tier system .will be taken out for the low end system how soon the forget they ps3 was stripped of allot of things to make it sell at 400 dolars .you also forget while sony did that they launched a program call PSnow .aka a rental servive to games.they also had a bunch of cry babys complain about not wanting bc . then those same people complained they want full bc back",,djwagon,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

It can be glitchy as f*ck, but runs on Ryzen 1600 which I think will represent next-gen CPUs quite well(consoles will probably get 8-core/16-thread 2GHz or something). PS5 has 7 nm Ryzen version NOT older 14 nm or 12 nm Ryzens. Ryzen (ZEN 2) at TSMC's 7nm solves two problems (PC and next-gen console markets) with one stone.

That's just not feasible, and would make the service prohibitively expensive. Plus, that would put it as another subscription gaming service on top of Game Pass (which is already $10 a month with just 100 or so titles... imagine the cost if it had the full catalog including all new releases from all publishers). Microsoft isn't trying to compete with Playstation Now. Xcloud is going to be something completely different, in an attempt to set the standard for what the future of game streaming is. That's why they compared it to digital movie and music - you can play that content anywhere.

178867947281,10/8/2018,http://savepointco.tumblr.com/post/178867947281,"For the last few years, many gamers have wondered whether we’ve reached the end of the road in regards to traditional game consoles. With integrated technologies like smart TVs, streaming services like PlayStation Now and more; dedicated gaming hardware is seeming less and less necessary. Enter Project xCloud, Microsoft’s take on cloud gaming based on their Azure cloud computing technology. They say that Xbox consoles will always have a place as the “flagship” experience for gaming, but how many will really want to shell out hundreds of dollars on additional hardware when they can stream games to their smart devices?

“… a world where you are empowered to play the games you want, with the people you want, whenever you want, wherever you are, and on any device of your choosing. “

That’s the elevator pitch in a nutshell for Microsoft’s proposed service. While you won’t be able to sign up for xCloud anytime soon it seems, the video above shows that Microsoft already has a functioning prototype in place, although we’re almost certainly seeing that tech work under best case scenario conditions.

xCloud allows you to play games on your phone, tablet, and other devices without game developers having to do any additional work. They’ve already enabled compatibility with existing and future Xbox games by building out custom hardware for their datacenters leveraging the company’s years of gaming experience. It sounds like all publishers will have to do is sign off on any of the more than 3,000 Xbox One games to get them on the xCloud service.  You’ll be able to play games with an Xbox One controller connected via Bluetooth or with dynamic on screen controls that adjust to suit any game. 

 The team at Microsoft has found a way to reduce latency while delivering a polished and playable experience thanks to their in house cloud technology. They’ve taken existing Xbox hardware and packed it into servers with plans to eventually deploy more across the 54 Azure Regions currently in place around the world. The plan is to begin public trials as soon as 2019, but expect development to be a multi-year journey. From there they’ll be able to learn and scale the platform to best serve the different regions in which it’s deployed.

It’s a novel idea, and potentially the future of gaming. While most of the world is only on the verge on 5G internet access, Microsoft is planning ahead for it. Imagine being able to play Halo on your massive 60-inch flat screen before taking the game on the go for your morning commute. This could be a move that brings players from different ecosystems together since it won’t matter if you’re on an Android, iOS or other platform. With xCloud, it sounds like everyone will be able to play together. We’ll have to wait and see how these ambitious plans pan out, but the implications are rather exciting!",,savepointco,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Microsoft introduces xCloud: Xbox without the box,Post,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== And in other news... reports are that the sky is blue",,jshigashi,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

Microsoft says its currently testing out Project xCloud and plans to open up tests to the public next year. In a blog post, the company said that game developers will be able to support the streaming service with no additional work, and that in addition to trying to solve the big ol latency problem (with Microsofts many datacenters), the team is developing a new, game-specific touch input overlay for controller-free playing. Our goal with Project xCloud is to deliver a quality experience for all gamers on all devices thats consistent with the speed and high-fidelity gamers experience and expect on their PCs and consoles, the company said.

Louis Cyphre said: This was bout BC, not Playstation Now, and I already knew they allowed downloads recently. Can you show me where it says they are working on PS2 and PS1 BC support? Thank you so much for your help. Now can you explain why Sony is not offering PS1 and PS2 BC in the traditional sense on the PS4? The Mad Draklor said: Your original claim was that Sony ""continues to use their blemished PS3 era as an excuse not to offer BC anymore"" in which I refuted that claim. Now, you pivoted the conversation into something else because your argument got refuted and could not make an adequate counterargument. What's more is that you don't seem to understand what BC is. Backwards compatibility is where legacy software can be run on current hardware. PS1 and PS2 downloads through PSNow would fit that description because the legacy software (PS1 and PS2 titles) will be downloaded to the PS4/PS5 and run from the PS4/PS5 hardware. We have already seen select PS2 titles available for download on the service. Now, it's up to Sony to grow that list. The one issue with BC is not so hardware related, but the logistics of it, namely licensing. Even Microsoft runs into these problems with their OG XB/360 BC initiative. And give me a break that you ""already knew"" because if that was the case, you wouldn't have made the response before the one I'm responding to now.

178945405610,10/11/2018,http://loopixo.tumblr.com/post/178945405610,"Game streaming is coming. It’s been coming since before we all laughed at OnLive and ignored PlayStation Now, and those too-little-too-soon gambits did nothing to impede its inevitable arrival. It is the future, in the sense that a credible and widely-used iteration of game streaming technology is around the corner and is something everyone reading this will probably end up using. Whether this future will prove mutually exclusive with other futures – those of games consoles and of digital platforms like Steam – is much more debatable. But it’s coming regardless.

The games industry was unequivocal on that fact at E3 this year. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot mentioned it to anyone who would listen, while EA promised its own service tied into EA Access. More consequentially (with the greatest respect to EA), Phil Spencer said Microsoft was planning an Xbox-branded game streaming service. Earlier this week, we heard the first details about what Microsoft is calling Project xCloud, in apparent response to last week’s announcement of a long-rumoured game streaming offering from Google. Google’s Project Stream is already in testing in the US; xCloud hardware is being installed in data centres, but public testing won’t begin until next year.

Game streaming is treated as an inevitability because this is the way all media has been going; just look at the rise to ubiquity of the music and video streaming services Spotify and Netflix. But game streaming is a far greater technical challenge, due to the extremely fast-moving and detailed live video and, of course, to its interactive nature, requiring an extremely low-latency two-way dialogue between the client and the server. This is where OnLive fell down and it’s part of the reason PlayStation Now still fails to impress (it’s also true that Sony has, frankly, never put together a very tempting or marketable offering for it). Low video quality is unappealing, but sluggish controls can break the experience completely.

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== gencid said: ↑ sean9986 said: ↑ gencid said: ↑ They shouldn't update what is proven to work well and even when they more radically updated it for PS4, I still think they should have left the analog sticks alone. PSX - a more ergonomic SNES controller with better D-Pad and dual bumpers Dual Shock - added twin stick, rumble and enabler button once Nintendo proved that the stick works better than D-Pad for 3D games and rumble was a great controller innovation Dual Shock 2 - made all buttons pressure sensitive which was essentially controller sex if it wasn't for the cord that kept the controller still tethered to the console Sixaxis - made Dual Shock 2 wireless, added 3 dimensional motion controls, turned the lower bumpers into trigger buttons (thanks a lot MS) but removed rumble due to lawsuit Dual Shock 3 - added rumble back to Sixaxis after it settled the lawsuit and if it weren't for the lower bumpers (triggers), it would have been potentially the best controller of all time Dual Shock 4 - adjusted controller ergonomics, swapped the perfect convex analog sticks with terrible concave ones, fixed the triggers, added touch pad thanks to the WiiU, had LEDs on the controller as to not give up unattractive motion controls which ate the controller battery life and renamed Start and Select menu buttons to Options and Share. Dual Shock 4 Pro - fixed the reliability of the analog sticks even though they are still worse than Dual Shock 3 and made part of the touch pad see-through for a sexier look So I guess you were mostly right about Sony not drastically changing their controller until PS4, but considering that the change brought significant downgrades in addition to some not very significant upgrades, I would actually rather them not change the controllers again and just improve on past screw ups which in 2018 would mean to change the sticks back to convex, minimize the real estate that a mostly useless touch pad takes, and either remove the LED lights from the controller or have an option to turn them ON or OFF, with the default option being OFF. Click to expand... I think the Led is there for vr so they can’t remove it. Basically yeah just make improvements. Battery life and the triggers. My triggers squeak when I press them. They’re so cheaply made Click to expand... Well, then they should just let people turn them OFF. If this is too hard to do through the OS, I will be fine with them putting a physical tiny button next to them to manually turning them off. I haven't had any issues with the triggers, though I think the squeaking noise is not exclusive to DS4. My DS3 also squeaks and so do some of my Nintendo controllers. Click to expand... No I agree. No reason we can’t turn it off.",,sean9986,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

If you do, I think it's more of a toss up. Noteworthy PS4 JRPGs not on Switch: * Dragon Quest XI (also on PC) * Persona 5 (PS4 exclusive) * Dragon Quest Heroes 1 and 2 (really more musou style arpgs, but also on PC) * NieR Automata (IMO more of an aRPG but the line is blurry, also on PC) * FF XV (also sort of an aRPG, also on PC). Switch did recently receive FF XV HD Pocket version though. * FF XII: The Zodiac Age (remake of PS2 game, also on PC) * Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami (both also on PC) * Yakuza 6 and Yakuza Kiwami 2 (for now PS4 exclusive but likely coming to PC soonish) * Soonish: Trails of Cold Steel 1 and 2 remakes (also on PC) * A bunch of JRPGs on PS3 via PSNow (separate subscription required) but may depend on internet. ​ Noteworth Switch JRPGs not on PS4: * Octopath Traveler * Xenoblade Chronicles 2 * Zelda: BotW (probably not a true JRPG but might satisfy a similar itch as aRPG / NieR) ​ JRPGs on both, perhaps with minor differences or performance differences: * Ys 8 * Valkyria Chronicles 1 and 4 (1 is coming to switch on Oct 16) * Dragon Quest Builders on both systems * I am Setsuna and Lost Sphear I believe are on both systems and also PC * FF XV HD Pocket version (same basic story afaik, different graphics / combat) * Dragon Quest XI is also coming to Switch, but no release date and could be 2020 (or skipped) for west. * Cosmic Star Heroine * Undertale * Other indie JRPGs I'm probably forgetting Other comments: Most final fantasy games on PS4 are coming to Switch in the 2019-ish. Specifically FF 7, 9, X/X-2, and FF XII. On the other hand, I've heard rumors that Octopath would eventually come to PS4 / PC, that it's a timed exclusive, but nothing to confirm or deny that. XC 2 is likely to stay on Switch. ​ If you have a gaming PC, then it's kind of a debate about Persona 5 + PSNow Subscription + DQ XI limited exclusive VS Octopath Traveler + Xenoblade Chronicles + Zelda + maybe some NES RPGs down the line. I think that's kind of a toss-up, especially if Switch library keeps growing while PS5 is rumored to be released in 2019 or early 2020. Without gaming PC, I think the sheer quantity on PS4 makes it a good choice, unless you really prefer portability or playing in bed. ​",,OhUmHmm,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Thanks to the same x86 architecture, it makes BC easy and cheap to port. PS5 will surely have a Ryzen CPU but don't expect a full desktop Ryzen; it most likely will have a low power mobile version found in laptops to keep temperatures, wattages and costs down but still it will be miles better than Jaguar. With Ryzen, 60fps standard is possible unless devs prioritize eyecandy, which will most likely be the case again sadly. Click to expand...

I'd be surprised if it releases earlier than autumn 2020 or later than autumn 2021, but I'd still like to be able to look at history and get a more concrete idea. Click to expand... Historically we've known about upcoming PlayStation systems a couple of years in advance. Only PS4 was announced and released on the same year, which is why I think 2019 could be a possibility even though 2020 is far more likely. Also with PS4 Pro still at $399.99, I don't expect PS5 to be less than $499.99 on day 1. Click to expand... I expect them to aim for $399, and my hope to that end is releasing an SKU without a disc drive, rather than compromising on the chips. Then they can put out a traditional version at $499 to the people who want to use physical media for movies/games. I think I'd go with the latter version, but I'm not even 75% sure I would. I don't buy used, I don't really sell my games unless they suck, and most of the time when I watch movies it's through my Plex server, Netflix/Hulu/Filmstruck/HBO Now, or iTunes purchases. 15 years ago I was serious about DVD collecting (I had about 350...), but in the current age that's just wasting shelf space. Plus, the PS4 Pro being $399 in 2018, roughly 2 years after it launched, doesn't necessarily mean it'll be $399 in 2019, 2020, or 2021 whenever day 1 of the PS5 is.... Click to expand... PS4 may release as soon as 2019, but absolutely no later than Fall 2020 and if it is substantially better than PS4 Pro, there is no way that it will retail for less than $100 over the PS4 Pro. $399.99 is actually the bare minimum price that PS5 will retail on launch day and considering where the tech is today and what the pricing structure seems to be on home consoles, I am willing to bet on the $499.99 price on day 1.",,gencid,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

178905531711,10/9/2018,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/178905531711,"Numerous game companies believe that streaming technology is the future. Now, Microsoft has announced its own approach to streaming video games: Project xCloud. The project aims to bring console-quality games to PC, consoles, and smart phone devices, and it will be rolling out public trials starting in 2019.

As detailed in the announcement, players will be able to use an Xbox One controller connected to supported devices. Smart phones can be used via Bluetooth, and a small attachment connects the controller to the phone for ease of use. If you don’t have an Xbox One controller, touch controls are also available.

The service uses Microsoft’s Azure as a backbone to set up new datacenters, with customized hardware that uses the parts of multiple Xbox One consoles. Azure has datacenters in 140 countries, so Microsoft feels it is already in a strong position to roll out the service wide-scale. It’s also developing ways to combat latency, with current tests running at 10 megabits per second. The ultimate goal is to make streaming available on 4G networks. Microsoft also notes the intention is for developers to be able to make their games available through xCloud without requiring any additional work from them (not unlike how it handles backwards compatibility on Xbox One).

Similarly, last week Google announced its own Project Stream, using Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to issue a technical test. PlayStation Now, meanwhile, has offered streaming games for quite a while, but recently began offering the option of downloading instead.

Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5?

The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware.

The one time Sony trief to surpasd MS with hardware (ps3) the price tag skyrocketed and even if the hardware was marginally better it was a hassle for devs to squeeze the juice. i am going to love all the crying .when they say the price and there is no way it will cost 400 dollars .the only way it will be that price .if they build a ps4 pro slim and call it the ps5 oh and you wangt proof people will pay 500 dollars look at the ps4 500million one that just launched Nobody listens or responds to you.

Because consoles need to bait people into buying their hardware with exclusives because otherwise there's nothing that special about it. Same with every console (and Oculus in the case of VR). Also, since nobody ""owns"" the PC platform (though Microsoft has tried and will probably keep trying) there's nobody to fund exclusives for PC even if they wanted them. The closest we get are games that small-time studios make for PC and have no interest or ability to port to consoles, OR a mid level studio spends money and resources to make on PC and it's too complex/demanding to cut it down to fit on a console. That's not to say that in either of those cases that the consoles will never get the game either, because if someone wants it badly enough, they'll pay for it to be ported. But again, nobody owns the PC platform so nobody is gonna fund a port. Eventually though when the contract for exclusivity runs out they may make a PC port just to rake in the extra money. But since Sony funded the development of the game, it's unlikely that will happen for many years (Until Sony has a new console to push and the game is being ""remastered""). Microsoft does own the Windows OS on PC and yes they have released PC exclusives like Age of Empire Definitive Edition that you can only on buy at the Windows store and nowhere else. Age of Empire Definitive edition(remake) is not yet available on the Xbox console at least until they have finished rolling out their support for keyboard and mouse for the Xbox One. They have also announced plans to remaster Age of Empire 2 and 3 and release Age of Empire 4 all of which are potentially Microsoft/Windows exclusives on the PC just like the first one. Sony unlike Microsoft never releases their console exclusives for sale on PC but older games can still be accessed by PC gamers via their PSNow service.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I'm just curious why there are a number of debates going on as to what the fee for xcloud will be, whether it will be bundled in with live or gamepass or a stand alone but I really can't understand why there would be a fee at all? ​ Lets start by not comparing it to Netflix or PSNow as both of these services come with a large catalog of content while xcloud is simply a streaming service that allows you to use content you have already purchased on ""any device"". So you are not getting any content/games just the ability to play on your phone as an example. ​ Now I believe the main target audience for this to be Japan, with well over 100million mobile devices in use, the Japanese spend almost 4 times more per month than Americans on mobile gaming per person. Somewhere around $10 average. Do the maths, its scary. ​ You can buy any xbox game without needing an xbox to play it.. it works on your phone.. The MS Store is going to get smashed with purchases. Forza will be on every Japanese phone (exaggeration). ​ With game sales going through the roof the cost of streaming services will be negligible, the additional sales in controllers, tablets, laptops, surfaces from the store will just be an added bonus. ​ And... the main thing that gets discussed every two minutes.. Japanese game developers will be fighting to put their content on the xbox store. ​ I'm just guessing here but I believe the service is going to be free or at the very most a benefit of having gold. ​ What are your thoughts on why it will or wont have a fee? ​ ​ ​",,RazarusMaximus,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

 A user plays Xbox and PC game Sea of Thieves on a tablet via game streaming. 

 * 
 This controller attachment was shown in Microsoft’s video, and Bluetooth wireless controller support is also planned. 

 * 
 Microsoft included this map of Azure datacenters in its blog post. These are the locations to which the service could be deployed, but don’t expect it all to happen at once. 

A new service from Microsoft called Project Xcloud is on the way, and it will stream Xbox games, not just to consoles and PCs, but to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Microsoft shared new information about its plans in a blog post and a talking-heads YouTube video. The company made a vague announcement about the new service at its E3 press conference earlier this year, but this is the first time the industry giant has provided details about how it works and when it might become available.


Microsoft is testing the service right now. Multiple control methods will be offered on mobile phones and tablets. First off, users will be able to pair an Xbox wireless controller with Bluetooth, and Microsoft showed footage of this in action with a phone-mount attachment for the controller. If a user doesn’t have a controller, Microsoft says it is “developing a new, game-specific touch-input overlay that provides maximum response in a minimal footprint.”


Games shown in early footage of the service include Sea of Thieves and entries in the Gears of War and Halo series. However, Xcloud will not be limited to first-party titles; the plan is to implement the service in such a way that no additional work will be required to support it from third-party developers. Microsoft hopes to achieve this in part by running the games on what amounts to native Xbox hardware in its data centers. ""We’ve architected a new customizable blade that can host the component parts of multiple Xbox One consoles,“ Microsoft wrote in its announcement. ""We will scale those custom blades in datacenters across Azure regions over time.”

VIDEO

A short video showing a render of the server blade Microsoft has developed.

Exploration of this concept is not new to Microsoft or the rest of the industry. Six years ago, documents leaked suggesting that Microsoft had targeted the now-defunct streaming service OnLive as a “potential acquisition target” because of the idea’s potential to disrupt the console market. A year later, Microsoft was testing streaming Halo to Windows phones. Sony acquired some of OnLive’s patents, and today it offers similar features in PlayStation Now, a service that streams games to your PlayStation console, laptop, or desktop computer. Additionally, Google recently announced a similar service for its Chrome platform called Project Stream.

However, Microsoft claims it now has a leg up over both Sony and its older self because of the global expansion of Azure, its enterprise-focused cloud-computing service. “With datacenters in 54 Azure regions and services available in 140 countries, Azure has the scale to deliver a great gaming experience for players worldwide, regardless of their location,” the blog post says. Project Xcloud is currently being tested out of one datacenter in Quincy, Washington. Microsoft claims that the current test experience is running at 10 megabits per second.

The goal is to make game streaming possible not just on broadband Internet in homes or upcoming 5G networks but on today’s 4G networks as well—that’s key, since many regions won’t see 5G for a while, and some of the non-core users Microsoft is trying to reach rely exclusively on mobile for Internet access.

In the video, Microsoft employees assure traditional gamers that consoles will still be a flagship experience but that this new service is about offering new choices and reaching more people who might not be inclined to buy a console. But given that many movers and shakers in the industry like Ubisoft believe services like Xcloud will eventually be essential rather than additive, there are concerns about saving games for posterity.


Creators and publishers of content and intellectual property generally have control over how their creations should be monetized and distributed, and that’s reasonable; it is their property, after all. If users don’t like the approach, they don’t have to buy the product. There are big upsides both financial and logistical in the short term to those creators for taking the streaming approach, and there are upsides of convenience for gamers who have strong broadband access, too. But there are also downsides, and game preservation is one of the most critical.


Some or all games streamed from the cloud in the future could be like today’s digitally distributed games in that they might not exist in physical media that can be resold or saved for posterity. But unlike today’s digital games, these streaming titles would not even exist as downloaded files that users could simply avoid deleting. So the preservation of games for future or revisiting players could become even more of a challenge.

That’s not just a problem for gamers who don’t want to lose their favorite games. It’s also a problem for developers, who often work long, difficult hours for years on end to produce works that could be lost in time.

The gaming industry as a whole has moved gradually to digital distribution, starting on PCs with Steam and its competitors before moving to consoles like the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch—and, of course, modern mobile games have always been digitally distributed. So this problem is not unique to streaming platforms. Many high-profile games are still offered on physical media in retail stores for now. But if cloud gaming eventually becomes as popular as companies like Microsoft, Google, Sony, and Ubisoft believe it will, though, the availability of physical media could change in the future.

If there’s no way to preserve current and future games that are only available in the cloud, we could be looking at something like the lost early days of MMOs and MUDs, many of which now exist only in gamers’ and creators’ memories. Games as a service are increasingly social events—""you had to be there,“ people might say in the future of the transient communities that pop up around online-games-of-the-moment like Fortnite. That approach comes with its own creative and experiential opportunities for the people who make compelling games and the people who play them. But they’re definitely not the same as what today’s players have enjoyed in the medium’s first 40 years.

The public trial for Project Xcloud will begin sometime in 2019.

Yeah, of COURSE it wouldn't please everyone, but given that the main issues people seem to have with this sort of service is ""streaming is inconsistent and unreliable"" and ""downloads are always so enormous"", this would prove to be a hypothetical ideal. We actually did something similar a while ago when we were working on the prototype online framework for The Division - you would download the basic game (which included most things, except high quality textures and sounds, which make up the meat of a download), and as the game was online-only ANYWAY, it'd stream your textures to buildings/characters etc as you played. It basically offered a neat middle-man. However, at the time, it was fairly untested as a design choice, and the higher-ups decided not to go this way, opting for a more traditional ""download like 60GB in one go"" model. This would also be great for smaller machines such as mobile phones, where you don't HAVE 1TB HDDs to play with. If you could get, say, a 1GB version of a 10GB game downloaded onto your phone, you could simply stream all the textures as the game played online. Then, should your internet start to choke out, the biggest problem would effectively be that the quality of the textures and sound files would bottom out, but the game would remain entirely playable. I wouldn't be surprised if this is something they implement. That doesn't have anything to do with a videogame streaming service like what xCloud is described as. This is literally a video stream sent to a device, no local data like textures or sound files are stored on the device itself. It's the same as Playstation Now and OnLive: the game itself is running on a datacenter system, your device sends input to it, and a video stream from the output of the system is sent to your local device. Your device itself is processing nothing except a video stream, and it's better that way for the fact that the experience is consistent across devices, doesn't require porting every game to a multitude of platforms (like the tens of thousands of Android device variants out there), and allows for instant access to any game without needing to download anything except the application that streams the service. Streaming of the data of a game played locally on a mobile device though would be incredibly convoluted and not really necessary, since the games are generally small enough anyway, and it would likely cause not only latency issues for online games but also be cumbersome to implement with little actual benefit. There's definitely a reason that feature is largely limited to things like MMOs.",,Solis,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Imagine playing Xbox games on your PlayStation, well that is happening sooner than later, with public trials by Microsoft starting in 2019 for their Project xCloud system, check it out below: Dubbed Project xCloud, it’s designed to work across consoles, PCs, and even mobile devices. “Scaling and building out Project xCloud is a multi-year journey for us,” explains Microsoft’s cloud gaming chief Kareem Choudhry . [/b]“We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations.”[/b] Microsoft has built custom hardware for its datacenters, as The Verge previously exclusively reported, so that existing and future Xbox games will be compatible with the services. Games will be streamed to devices, and Microsoft has been testing the xCloud service with Xbox wireless controllers connected to consoles, mobile devices, and PCs. Microsoft says its research teams are “creating ways to combat latency” via advanced network techniques combined with video encoding and decoding. This should make game streaming viable on 4G networks, too. Public trials of the service will begin next year, and Microsoft’s Xbox game streaming service will face competition from a variety of existing services. The most popular include GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Microsoft’s xCloud unveiling comes just days after Google announced its own Project Stream service that will let testers play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop. Microsoft isn’t revealing exactly what it’s doing differently than the competition, but we’ll find out more details when public testing starts in 2019. Click to expand... So what do you think? - Is dedicated console gaming finally coming to its death? - Is this the wave of the future, now with WiFi 6 recently announced, which also is starting in 2019 and it promises less lag, and more people having gigabit internet in their homes, we might just be nailing down the coffin shut finally on are be-loved consoles, so use them while you can, as death is staying over them!

The end user no longer possesses anything at all. Not even a digital download on their local console. Pretty much piracy proof. But I have a question. Are they going to stream every game forever? I doubt it. What happens when they decide to drop whatever game. Will it be made available as a digital download or physical copy to users who are still playing it? I doubt that too. I suspect when games are retired, users will be SOL. And anyone who complains will be told ""Didn't you read the user agreement? It clearly states your payment is for a temporary lease to access content while it remains available. Availability will be guaranteed only for a period of time specified by the developer and may vary depending on game. Once a game is removed from the library, it will no longer be accessible. No refunds. Welcome to the future, now piss off."" Yeah, I think that's pretty much it. All we need now is controllers with fingerprint readers on the thumb sticks to make sure only the specific individual who actually paid for this temporary lease can actually play it.

178887183763,10/9/2018,http://newsbytes-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/178887183763,"09 Oct 2018: #GamingBytes: Sony announces it is working on PS4 successor 

Sony officially went on record, announcing it is working on a successor of PS4. 

Though the upcoming console has not yet been labeled, a good guess is that it will be called PlayStation 5 or PS5. 

Sony’s newest console will compete with Microsoft’s device which was announced at E3, this year, by the team that made Xbox One X. 

Read about it here.

Release reasons : The necessity for advanced gaming hardware 

Sony boss, Kenichiro Yoshida said in an interview, “At this point, what I can say is it’s necessary to have a next-generation hardware”. 

However, it does not appear that the upcoming console will depart radically from PS4 and, going by early indications, their fundamental architectures will be similar. 

Moreover, Sony is not rushed to release it since PS4 is still helping them earn billions.

Streaming options: Streaming is the big gaming aspect now 

While not much is known about Sony’s upcoming console, streaming will be a key offering. 

Sony already has forayed into this through its PlayStation Now service that gamers have to subscribe to. 

Microsoft too announced Project xCloud, its streaming service, and chatter suggests the upcoming consoles will have multiple types - traditional and streaming. 

It remains to be seen if Sony will follow suit.",,newsbytes-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,#GamingBytes: Sony announces it is working on PS4 successor,Post,,

178855669382,10/8/2018,http://reuters1618-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/178855669382,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is testing a new game streaming service called Project xCloud that is designed to work across PCs, consoles and mobile devices, the company said on Monday.
 Public trials for Project xCloud would begin in 2019, Microsoft said.
 “We are testing Project xCloud today. The test runs on devices (mobile phones, tablets) paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller through Bluetooth, and it is also playable using touch input,” Kareem Choudhry, corporate vice president, gaming cloud, said in a blog post.
 The service will compete with Google’s “Project Stream”, a game streaming service that is being tested by the Alphabet Inc unit in partnership with game publisher Ubisoft.
 Microsoft’s xCloud will also face competition from other popular streaming services including Nvidia’s GeForce Now and Sony’s PlayStation Now among others.

But don't you think the PS5 can resolve these issues. Certainly if there are known defects with past ""emulation"", Sony can correct this? I'm all for backwards compatibility. It's better than nothing. ""Issues"" and all. Since emulation has gotten better yes when it comes to PS1,PS2 games. I fully expect PS3 games to have issues (if they do it at all) and I wouldn't be surprised if they just go the MS route and recompile games that you just download. I pray they don't because my wall of 100+ PS3 titles would be great to play on PS5. Part of me kinda expects them to roll out PS1/PS2 emulation for PS4 near the end of its life (like the last year) just to test whatever setup they are using to do it. But I could be wrong and just hoping they will. If PS5 is just a PS5 and nothing more, I'll honestly just look forwards to the Switch 2, and save my money.

Test invites have begun trickling out for Project Stream, Google’s first official take on a dedicated, current-gen gaming platform. As has long been rumored, Google has opted for an online-streaming format (if its current, temporary name wasn’t hint enough), and this week’s test (which included invited members of the press) sees the company serving a modern game to users via the Chrome Web browser.

Though we only have one day (and one game) of testing under our belts, we can already tell that Project Stream is shaping up to be something solid, if not revolutionary. That’s not a bad start for a game-streaming space that’s already pretty well occupied—and will be growing at least one bigger before long.

Heads in the cloud

Game companies have toyed with cloud-powered gaming for some time now, with OnLive having the dubious honor of being first out of the gate (and first out of the industry). Nvidia and Sony continue to serve games this way, so long as users pay a monthly fee and have the right combination of installed app and compatible device.

With that stuff established, the services let users log in to a server farm, where one instance of a given game is individually loaded and served. From there, the farm handles all of your video game’s processing, so you can arguably play your game on a home device as simple as a video-streaming box or smart-TV processing chip. The biggest variable for gamers is the connectivity. Bad online performance can result in reduced visual quality, input lag, and even lost visual frames.

 * 
 Our MacOS rig, ready to stream! 

 * 
 The simple testing animation that plays out after attaching an invite to your Google account. 

 * 
 The failure message that pops up if your connection isn’t up to snuff. 

 * 
 What do you need for Project Stream as of launch? This stuff (in addition to an invite, as the test is currently closed.) 

 * 
 One really interesting aspect of Project Stream: it offers a whopping 20-minute timer for inactivity. (PlayStation Now yanks a much tighter leash on its players.) 

 * 
 What'dja think? 

Got all that? Then you have Project Stream (at least, at a baseline level).

Google would love for us to believe that its new streaming service is doing something particularly special with things like video encoding and lag reduction, and the company implied as much when its reps offered to connect Ars Technica to sources “close” to Project Stream. But that offer came with caveats, particularly about how the system’s underlying tech could change radically before launch. We’d rather wait until Google can offer comprehensive comment on what’s under Project Stream’s hood.

For now, the service’s first differentiating feature may very well be the difference maker for interested players: that it works on any desktop instance of Google Chrome. As in, a huge majority of Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS machines in the wild. So long as you have valid credentials and your device passes Google’s current bandwidth test (a “stable streaming rate” of at least 15Mbps, latency below 40ms, and a packet-loss rating of five percent or less), Project Stream will deem your device, whether wired or wireless, up to its snuff. From there, play via keyboard-and-mouse or any number of supported gamepads.

Comparatively, PlayStation Now is limited to Windows 10 PCs and PlayStation 4 consoles (with an app-install requirement and support solely for DualShock 4 controllers). Meanwhile, GeForce Now only works on a Shield TV device with attached compatible controller.

 * 
 Keyboard and mouse support is baked in… 

 * 
 … while switching to a wired controller is as easy as plugging and playing. (Should you already have wireless controller support set up for your gaming computer, it’ll work here, as well.) 

 * 
 Not a ton of in-game options to pick from, however, in terms of the visual tweak options you might expect in a PC version. Thus, we can’t answer definitively what PC settings are toggled for this Project Stream version of Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey. 

 * 
 We didn’t max out Project Stream’s number of save files, but after getting to 15, we felt like they’re offering a decent amount of save memory for users. 

 * 
 I show this loading screen solely to point out how quickly Project Stream loads AC:O. Load times from a fresh boot are as short as eight seconds, well below the boot time on our most powerful PC testing rig as of press time. 

Say what you will about required apps or about your fondness for Chrome compared to other browsers, but it’s hard to overstate how smooth the results are. The experience of loading the official Project Stream site in Chrome, passing a brief network test (only once per device), and booting into a game is far simpler than any other cloud-gaming service we’ve ever tested.

This goes doubly for plugging in game controllers, as we got two generations of Xbox pad and Sony’s DualShock 4 to work with zero setup. In one test, I was mid-game on a MacOS device, testing with mouse-and-keyboard, then plugged an Xbox One pad into that system (and I’d never plugged an Xbox One pad into that laptop, nor had I previously installed XB1 drivers). It. Just. Worked. The game immediately switched to Xbox on-screen button prompts and worked as expected. That’s not to say mileage won’t vary for other hardware juggles, but it’s certainly a promising indicator this early into the test period.

Cloudy view from Mount Olympus?

 Every screen in this gallery is from a wireless test, not a wired one, and gosh, it looks good. But before we get into specifics…

Yeah, the delay is 10's of frames but that is fine for online games anyway. Onlive and Gaikai were bought by Sony and that tech is now part of PSNow. That's the levels of latency you can expect from this (maybe a little more lag in Europe and Asia depending on how many xbox blade farms they install there). The connection required for this one is 10mbps but they may be trying to push a higher res or something. The issue I have with this tech is that it eats data fast. 2.3 Gb an hour. That's fine for me at home but that is an automatic no for me when I'm on my phone. This is why I think PSNow stopped supporting the android app. In most places there are data caps on mobile data plans and that would eat my monthly data in one sittiing, the Smart TV/At-home crowd was also just not worth chasing as a reason to support the android app because most people probably didn't use it and used their PC or console anyway.

I don’t have a data cap either but your provider will throttle the s*** outta you if you start streaming games. Want proof? Tether your phone to your console and see how far you get playing a game. I’ll be surprised if it’s even playable. Definitely playable. I relied on smartphone tethering for quite some time for all of my home devices, including games and consoles, and it worked great. In fact the speeds I've gotten on my phone have been much better than the average home broadband connection in the US. Taken from howtogeek.com : “The most important thing holding back cloud gaming is internet speed. You need a fast, stable internet connection to take advantage of cloud gaming. Ideally, you’ll need a consistent 50 Mbps downstream speed, and that’s if you’re not sharing that speed with others. Having two people playing games at the same time, or having someone else streaming video in the other room, eats into that speed.” You must have the most wonderful provider in the world cause with sprint, I ideally max at about 30-31. Ideally. Ping is another big issue with this service. I avg about 35-40 on my connection and PSNow gives me lag because of my ping. I've gotten over 100mbps downstream on Verizon 4G, with pings as low as 30ms with 5ms jitter. Of course, it will be highly dependent on signal quality, tower load, etc. Edit: also, the bandwidth usage of online gaming are grossly overstated by most. Generally playing a game online won't use more than about 2mbps of total bandwidth. Even Netflix maxes out at around 30mbps of bandwidth for its highest quality stream, iirc. That’s playing a game. Streaming it is completely different. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/56knv8/how_much_bandwidth_does_playstation_now_use/#ampf=undefined These guys are pulling 100s of gigs a month.

Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== The most interesting thing from PS5 for me would be the form that the Dual Shock 5 will take. I also hope it releases next year instead of 2020, so that I can stop adding games to my PS4 backlog.",,gencid,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

What's not relevant, that one can provide BC for free while you find every excuse under the sun why the other can't? This topic is about the PS5 and BC, I don't think people want to hear your suggestions to how it will handle it. You don't even know what it is you're addressing at this point. This was your first comment to me, The CELL being very difficult to emulate is not some lame excuse. Comparing that to PS1 BC on the PS2 is an unfair comparison.

The following excerpts are from Ars Technica: Quote: A new service from Microsoft called Project Xcloud is on the way, and it will stream Xbox games, not just to consoles and PCs , but to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Microsoft shared new information about its plans in a blog post and a talking-heads YouTube video . Microsoft is testing the service right now. Multiple control methods will be offered on mobile phones and tablets... Games shown in early footage of the service include Sea of Thieves and entries in the Gears of War and Halo series. However, Xcloud will not be limited to first-party titles; the plan is to implement the service in such a way that no additional work will be required to support it from third-party developers. Microsoft hopes to achieve this in part by running the games on what amounts to native Xbox hardware in its data centers . ""We've architected a new customizable blade that can host the component parts of multiple Xbox One consoles ,"" Microsoft wrote in its announcement. "" We will scale those custom blades in datacenters across Azure regions over time ."" They also mention they intend to utilise 5G capabilities even though the technology is in it's infancy, as well as standard broadband and 4G technologies. Quote: The goal is to make game streaming possible not just on broadband Internet in homes or upcoming 5G networks but on today's 4G networks as well —that's key, since many regions won't see 5G for a while, and some of the non-core users Microsoft is trying to reach rely exclusively on mobile for Internet access. In their video they mentioned that they have it running small-scale and in-house but it's still some time away from general use. All we know is 2019. Quote: The public trial for Project Xcloud will begin sometime in 2019 . My Thoughts: The Xbox team are fully utilising the position they're in, they have the financial and technological support of Microsoft and are taking advantage of the Azure cloud. It's obviously a big advantage for them over their competitors but also it will be interesting to see now Google and Microsoft competing for Cloud game-streaming dominance and it makes me wonder whether or not Sony are paying attention... I suggest watching the video, they details the custom blades they've designed for their data centres, fascinating stuff and it's definitely the way of the future and no one can deny that. What does the community think? ====================::==================== 3 hours ago, ravenshrike said: There's a reason that PSNow went from streaming to streaming and downloading, and it's not because streaming was considered adequate by the majority of the userbase. I'd argue that Microsoft has better infrastructure already in place, but the proof is in the pudding as they say and we just don't know. I think even if it is disappointing on launch, they won't be quick to abandon the technology like Sony has. Microsoft has to be all in on cloud-computing, I think it's a big part of their business moving forward, they can't afford to lose out on market share like they did with the mobile market for example. 2 hours ago, huilun02 said: Good luck selling to people with poor internet access It's going to rough here in Australia, that's for sure.",,ZacoAttaco,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Microsoft and Xbox announce Project xCloud,,,

Thanks to services like NVIDIA GeForce Now and PlayStation Now, the gaming industry has been experimenting a lot with the act of streaming video games over an internet connection rather than running them locally on a console or PC. Now, the latest company to dip its toes in the streaming games market is Google.

178883571685,10/9/2018,http://loopixo.tumblr.com/post/178883571685,"It’s no coincidence that less than one week after Google announced Project Stream, Microsoft has broken cover with more details on its own streaming platform, dubbed Project xCloud. The core idea behind both platforms is the same – and very familiar to longer term readers of this site. Rather than buy a console and play games on it, titles are hosted on the cloud instead. The user has a basic client device that beams input commands over the internet, with video and audio streamed back. The concept is simple – Netflix for games – but the application is somewhat more challenging. Prior attempts at getting this to work have fallen flat but Microsoft, Google – and other unannounced players – reckon that the time is right for the technology to work. 

Microsoft’s announcement trailer shows key first party Xbox franchises – Forza, Gears of War and Halo – running on tablets and smartphones. These are low-power devices incapable of running games of this complexity but what they do have in common is the inclusion of hardware-accelerated video decoding – and along with internet access, that’s all that’s needed for this concept to work. All the game code is hosted on servers within the datacentre, and the Microsoft reveal video tells us that the platform holder has built bespoke hardware for xCloud, based on a stripped down, rebuilt version of the Xbox One S console. 

On the face of it, it might not sound as if there’s too much new going on here. After all, PlayStation Now is built on the same principle of stock console hardware refactored into blade servers, hosted in datacentres. However, Microsoft is making specific claims in its video which could represent a fundamental improvement over the Sony offering in terms of image quality – and especially latency.

According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar.""

Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== As long as it runs PS5 games that's all that matters. If it just runs the same software the PS4 aready runs then its just another useless thing with no reason to exist.

Pretty good chance with PS2 and PS1 as well.(the real question is how they do it, IE the right way like PS3 OG did with discs playing or if only digital copies work, or even worse they make you rebuy versions with trophies like current PS2 classics on PS4). PS3, I still think that is more of a tossup and really depends on if Sony wants to devote programming resources that could help actually making game to one by one recompile each game similar to what you see with 360 games on XBO as there is no way they are sticking a cell in the PS5(lol @ the guy who said that btw). I think the PS5 will have disk BC with PS1/2 and clearly PS4 but like I said you said the PS3 BC is up in the air. There is many ways they could go about it even more so when they got PSNow and could just go the MS way with that. Also I fully agree there is no chance in hell Sony would put a Cell Processor in the PS5 and that would require the Mobo to be a duel CPU mobo. Making the system cost a fuck ton of money.

Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== We knew that already. The only question really is which strategy Sony will follow. If they want to build a powerhouse with a true generational leap we`re either looking at a very expensive end 2019 release or a sth similarly priced to the launch ps4 price mid-end 2020. However a more incremental upgrade would also be possible. A PS5 with 2-3x a Pro`s power should be doable for a reasonable price by the end of 2019. That would be a 4+x over the original PS4. Add a good CPU to that and we should be fine for a while.",,Phrixotrichus,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

Super Mario Brothers is one of the greatest games ever, and so is the Legend of Zelda. Those games are available to you, forever (as long as you're subscribed, tee hee!) for absolutely free (with a yearly fee, but it's so trivial it shouldn't be used against it) Frankly as janky as the service can be, ""PlayStation Now"" is simply a superior service, especially now that it supports game downloading. 20 bucks for 20 NES games VS 100 bucks for 700+ PlayStation 2, 3, and 4 games. Yyyeah... and I'd say the same about X-Box GamePass, though I'm less familiar with its library. Excitebike? Ice Climber? Double Dragon? Ice Hockey? Donkey Kong? Tennis? NES Open Tournament? (sports classic) The last NES games that ever needed to see the light of day again were the sports titles. Oh, and is that not good enough? Need more punishment, Mr. Entitled? NINJA GAIDEN! THIS DECEMBER! If that's not good enough, Mighty Bomb Jack and Solomons Key will keep ya busy! (Wario's Woods isn't one to sleep on, either, and neither is classic Twinbee) I have Ninja Gaiden on my NES Classic. So basically, you get 20 full length games with brand new online play (which technically qualifies them as new games) and restore points for the first time ever on an official Nintendo console, with voice chat, online play and a mobile phone app all included in 20 bones a year? Compared to what, PS4 and it's flunky-bum forced online games like Steep, The Crew and Overwatch. I already have most of these games with restore points on an official Nintendo consoles. The only addition is multiplayer, and most of the games worth playing don't have simultaneous multiplayer anyway. Also calling them ""full length"" games is just plain wrong. Full length in the 80's is not the same as full-length today. 20 full length technically new games that will be ever expanding with a custom controller for a fair price > 2 mediocre games a month that you can only nab for 30 days You are trying so hard, and getting so far... yet in the end it doesn't even matter. NSO is still a terrible deal even at 20 bucks. B...but.... PSNow only offers a meager helping of meat, while NSO offers a three course deluxe meal! Surely you understand me.

Now, Microsoft has announced its own approach to streaming video games: Project xCloud. The project aims to bring console-quality games to PC, consoles, and smart phone devices, and it will be rolling out public trials starting in 2019.

As detailed in the announcement, players will be able to use an Xbox One controller connected to supported devices, and a small attachment connects the controller to a smart phone for portable gaming. If you don’t have an Xbox One controller, touch controls are also available.

The service uses Microsoft’s Azure as a backbone to set up new datacenters, with customized hardware that uses the parts of multiple Xbox One consoles. Azure has datacenters in 140 countries, so Microsoft feels it is already in a strong position to roll out the service wide-scale. It’s also developing ways to combat latency, with current tests running at 10 megabits per second. The ultimate goal is to make streaming available on 4G networks.

Similarly, last week Google announced its own Project Stream, using Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to issue a technical test.

Microsoft has announced its own online game streaming service: Project xCloud. The gaming world is changing, and we’ve seen the likes of Blade’s Shadow, Nvidia’s GeForce Now, Playstation Now, and even Google Chrome’s own browser-based streaming solution gain traction over the last year. And now Microsoft, the PC and console giant, will join the list of hopeful tech companies fighting for streaming supremacy. While technically an Xbox streaming service, Microsoft has been set on opening up its gaming library to more devices than just its own proprietary hardware as of late – with Windows PCs some of the first to benefit. This move looks to be similarly targeting the platform boundaries we’ve been locked behind for so long, instead opening up the Xbox library to more devices than the company’s dedicated hardware can reach alone. Project xCloud will use custom server rack hardware to power the experience – all based on existing Xbox One console components. That means custom AMD GPUs and accompanying memory will be the workhorse keeping Microsoft’s cloud gaming servers ticking over. This looks to be a big win for AMD – most cloud servers we’ve run into so far have employed Nvidia graphics cards for the grunt work rather than team red’s tech. AMD works closely with both Microsoft and Sony on their respective Xbox One and Playstation consoles. AMD’s Navi architecture, arriving sometime in 2019, was even rumoured to be making its way into a future Playstation 5 console. But it’s the software developments that might interest us PC folk most of all. Latency poses a huge challenge for anyone developing a streaming service, or indeed playing one, but Microsoft reckons it has the best expertise and access to deliver a stronger streaming service than ever with Project xCloud.",,caromero1965,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,MS announced AMD based cloud game streaming,,,

Additionally, because compression has to take place in real time, it isn't as space efficient as video streaming, which - due to buffering and such - can do certain things in the compression algorithm and image analysis to reduce bandwidth while maintaining quality, that aren't as feasible for a live compressed feed that has no ability to look at future frames while compressing. As a result, game streaming will use *more* bandwidth... and some quick Google-fu shows that PSNow uses 12 Mbps for 720p60, which is 5.4 GB/hour, while *4K/30 video* usually uses 7-10 GB. Extrapolating to 1080p60 for video game live compression, you're probably looking at 12 GB/hour for 1080p60, and 48 GB/hour for 4K... or basically, ~1 hour of streaming a game at 4K could have downloaded the *average* 4K game. Or, for the same bandwidth, you could have watched 5-7 hours of 4K/30 video.",,MaineQat,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The StormCloud is back Baby!!! :P The story. --- Microsoft Announces Game Streaming, Testing To Begin Next Year Want to play Halo on your phone? Microsoft has announced its own approach to streaming video games, called Project xCloud. The project aims to bring console-quality games to PC, consoles, and smart phone devices, and will be rolling out public trials starting in 2019. As detailed in the announcement, players will be able to use an Xbox One controller connected to supported devices, and a small attachment connects the controller to a smart phone for portable gaming. If you don't have an Xbox One controller, touch controls are also available. The service uses Microsoft's Azure as a backbone to set up new datacenters, with customized hardware that uses the parts of multiple Xbox One consoles. Azure has datacenters in 140 countries, so Microsoft feels it is already in a strong position to roll out the service wide-scale. It's also developing ways to combat latency, with current tests running at 10 megabits per second. The ultimate goal is to make streaming available on 4G networks. Similarly, last week Google announced its own Project Stream, using Assassin's Creed Odyssey to issue a technical test.

I'm currently testing Google's experimental game streaming service, Project Stream and have the delight of playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey for free using it. I was heavily skeptical, but because of my dwindling computer power, wanted to check it out to see if it works as intended and can be a viable solution to my desire to not spend money on a new PC. Let me set the record straight, games streaming to your devices IS INEVITABLE, but I do not think it will replace physical and digital media, but it will be a VERY VIABLE option for a certain demographic and they will love it. It works.... a hell of a lot better than I expected. There was no input lag that I noticed, even during moments where it notified me, ""YOUR INTERNET STINKS!"" at that point there was some video compression, but those happened in very very small instances. For the bulk of the time the image quality was great! It wasn't running on max settings but it looked high. There were some weird lighting issues where sometimes the game was brighter than other moments. I was insanely impressed as to how well this worked. Now, when it launched worldwide, I dont know how well it will do and I know that folks with slower connection speeds will have issues (my internet is middle of the road). In the end, my computer couldn't handle this game normally, but can now. If I have no loyalty to owning games outright, this is a viable option and it worked stellarly. It was so surprising. ====================::==================== Games streaming to devices is not mainstream yet. Psnow is flawed and half assed. We are seeing big name developers focus on it and test it with capcom in the Japanese market streaming RE7 on the switch and stating it a success with ubisoft testing it with Google's project stream. There is a big difference between streaming music and movies versus games. Having little to no input lag is a huge necessity to break through the market. I kid you not, the next generation of systems will offer two versions of their hardware, a $500 version of physical hardware and a $100 version which will be a tiny box you just plug into your tv and stream.

On Monday, Microsoft entered the ring with Project xCloud, an ambitious attempt to make Xbox games playable on tablets and phones through the company’s cloud computing architecture. Essentially, Microsoft will use its massive Azure cloud system to make games like “Halo” and “Sea of Thieves” playable on more than just Xbox devices, and with more than just Xbox controllers. Bluetooth controllers will be supported, but players will also be able to play those games with a touch interface, according to xCloud promotional materials. Playing your favorite game on your favorite device is the future of gaming. _ #ProjectxCloud brings us one step closer to making that a reality: https://t.co/TIA5NqcKUR — Microsoft (@Microsoft) October 8, 2018 Microsoft has Azure data centers in 54 different regions, which will eventually be outfitted with custom Xbox hardware to enable wireless-game streaming. The company is banking on the quality of its cloud tech being able to overcome the many issues that have made game streaming a novelty at best in other available services. Game-streaming services like PlayStation Now and the long-discontinued OnLive all run into the same problem: video games are interactive. Drops in streaming quality, latency between button presses, on-screen responses and sudden buffering are all far more disruptive to the experience than they would be while streaming a movie. A lack of consistent broadband availability and monthly data caps in parts of the U.S. also make game streaming inaccessible to some potential customers. Microsoft acknowledged some of those problems, claiming its technology could provide a solution that works across a wide variety of networks and devices. Microsoft unveiled Project xCloud. A control of a Microsoft's Xbox One game console is pictured in a shop in Shanghai on September 29, 2014. Photo: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images “Our goal is to deliver high-quality experiences at the lowest possible bitrate that work across the widest possible networks, taking into consideration the uniqueness of every device and network,” Microsoft corporate VP of gaming cloud Kareem Choudhry wrote in the xCloud announcement post. Project xCloud is in private testing now and will enter a public testing phase in 2019. If it works, it could boost the company’s gaming revenue by offering Xbox titles to customers who do not own Xbox consoles. Last week, Google announced a similar undertaking with Project Stream . The invite-only beta will let participants play through the recently released “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” within the Chrome web browser.",,Alex Perry,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,M,,,,Microsoft Enters Game Streaming Market With Xbox-Focused Project xCloud,,,

It was the rather poor selection that stopped me from subbing after the first month or so. Never really paid much attention to it since then. Then I saw Red Dead Redemption was available for PSNow and thought, hey what the hell. I got decent internet, lets throw down. Been so long since I played Redemption and 2 is coming up in a few weeks, what better way to pass the time than to replay the old one. Hey even saw there is a new 7 day trial for NOW so win win! Im very pleasantly surprised by what I found upon entering. PC support, PS2/PS3/PS4 games available to play and ALOT of games I LOVE. Dark Cloud 1/2, Ni No Kuni, Yakuza 5, Disgaea 2/4/5, puzzle fighter turbo, twisted metal, motorstorm, tekken, on and on. Just a pretty fantastic game selection. You can even download games to your system now to play them at max resolution without any extra bandwidth requirements. Pretty slick. I have played about 3 hours of Redemption today and must say the quality has improved from back in the day. The input lag is very minimal to the point to where I only thought of it just now and the graphics quality is just like how it should be. Im even on WiFi atm so not even hooked up on Ethernet. So well done. I may just do the 20$ a month for this. Its pretty great, so many damn games.",,OpticalPrime35,United States of America,,,Negative,Unclassified,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The PS2 BC PS3 is my favorite system of all time. Historically we've known about upcoming PlayStation systems a couple of years in advance. Only PS4 was announced and released on the same year, which is why I think 2019 could be a possibility even though 2020 is far more likely. Also with PS4 Pro still at $399.99, I don't expect PS5 to be less than $499.99 on day 1. Click to expand... I expect them to aim for $399, and my hope to that end is releasing an SKU without a disc drive, rather than compromising on the chips. Then they can put out a traditional version at $499 to the people who want to use physical media for movies/games. I think I'd go with the latter version, but I'm not even 75% sure I would. I don't buy used, I don't really sell my games unless they suck, and most of the time when I watch movies it's through my Plex server, Netflix/Hulu/Filmstruck/HBO Now, or iTunes purchases. 15 years ago I was serious about DVD collecting (I had about 350...), but in the current age that's just wasting shelf space. Plus, the PS4 Pro being $399 in 2018, roughly 2 years after it launched, doesn't necessarily mean it'll be $399 in 2019, 2020, or 2021 whenever day 1 of the PS5 is.... Click to expand... PS4 may release as soon as 2019, but absolutely no later than Fall 2020 and if it is substantially better than PS4 Pro, there is no way that it will retail for less than $100 over the PS4 Pro. $399.99 is actually the bare minimum price that PS5 will retail on launch day and considering where the tech is today and what the pricing structure seems to be on home consoles, I am willing to bet on the $499.99 price on day 1. Click to expand... I'd definitely take that bet. But like I said it's not out of the question that there'd be a $499 PS5 at launch...the issue is whether there would be multiple SKUs. I think they'll remember quite clearly the cheers they got back in 2013 announcing the $399 PS4 vs the $499 Xbox One. I'd say it's likely that if tech is too expensive for a discless PS5 to be viable at $399 at the specs they're targeting, they'll push the release back until component prices decrease enough to make it viable rather than risk releasing one lone option at $499.",,theunentitled,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

For instance [USER=100781]Thanakil[/USER] spent 400 bucks i guess for a PS4 Pro just to play Red Dead Redemption 2 a game that sadly isn't on PC. Imagine if he had the type of mobile connection i have with up to 160mbits and unlimited? he may not agree now but i bet he would at least consider to use such a service and play the game on PC instead by streaming it if it works well and save money.[/quote] It depends greatly on the quality of the picture + frame rate. I'm a huge fan of open world games, so I also wanted to play Horizon: Zero Dawn, Spider-Man and get access to the rest of the Yakuza games. Since consoles already limit you in term of options, I wouldn't mind streaming those games over having my own console, but the quality isn't there yet. Google's video is much better than what PSNow currently offers, but I own AC: Odyssey and it's easy for me to compare and see the difference. It's a huge improvement compared to previous streaming services, but it's still not comparable to the real thing. So if I had to choose between paying 400$ and having the full quality, or subscribing to a service of - let's assume - 15$ a month, I'd still go for the physical console. Since I play games daily, I'm gonna get my money's worth out of it. In that regard, streaming isn't the best choice for me. Some of the games also got quite cheaper, Horizon + Expansion was only 30$ CAD. With that said, I'd definitely recommend a service like this to my sister, who enjoys gaming but doesn't get to do it often and who has no gaming equipment whatsoever. Since she doesn't play games very often, she's also less likely to see the difference in visual quality, and less likely to care about it. For me, since I'm gonna be spending a lot of money on video games no matter which option I choose, streaming would need to be really close to the real thing to be worth it. They'll probably get there eventually.",,Thanakil,,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Considering how Sony's realized with the PS4 that going with an easy-to-develop-for PC architecture was the way to go and that it's pretty much certain that the PS5 will use a very similar or even identical architecture, I would be extremely pissed if it didn't have backwards compatibility with at least the PS4. Then again, considering how much more powerful the PS5 will be in relation to all the other Playstation systems, backwards compatibility with all of them isn't a pipe dream, either. I think it makes sense for them to release it now as well, the remaster craze seems to have died down a little and I think people wouldn't have taken kindly to yet another generation of remasters. Just give us backwards compatibility already so we can look forward to the future! Personally, what do I want from BC on the PS5 if this rumor does indeed happen to be true? Disc-based backwards compatibility . Why have backwards compatibility if all of my old physical games are no good? Backwards compatibility with ALL previous Playstations . That would be the dream. And, as stated before, should be entirely within the realm of possibility if Sony were to put their minds to it. Backwards compatibility with our previous save data. Now THIS would be the icing on the cake. If I could just pick up right where I left off... now that would be the dream. I would like it if they at least have BC with saves from the PS3 and PS4. PS1 and PS2 might be a little harder considering they use a completely different system, but if they actually manage to have a memory card port, or at the very least sell a separate accessory... I'm probably going to get that bad boy day one. Free online play for PS3 titles . If it was free on the PS3, then we should have the same experience on the PS5. So, what do you guys think? Excited for the prospect of backwards compatibility (FINALLY)? And what do you personally want from it? ====================::==================== 39 minutes ago, Spaz said: I don't see the point, unless those old consoles are going to be collectors items at some point, just like how some elderly people hold on to antiques that are worth a fortune because they're rare and nobody makes them anymore. The recent re-releases of such games as Shemnue 1 and 2 work in my opinion because of the time that has passed. Something like Assassins Creed Rogue Remastered I think is purely done to get some more cash out of people, but mainly to attract those who never got around to the game when it first released. But knowing Ubisoft, they probably did just as shitty of a job with the PS4 version of Rogue as they did with the Ezio Auditore Collection. The one and only reason I still have a Playstation 3 is simply because there are a lot of games only for that system that will probably never see the light of day on Playstation Now. Same with the Vita, which is worse off because Sony has pretty much entirely abandoned that console. If these games were somehow put on the PS4, then yeah, I would of ditched the older consoles years ago. But even if they were on there, I probably wouldn't pay too much attention as most games I don't care about. There's a lot to be grateful for on the PS4. People can never have enough. Which you can still do today. I have no sympathy for those who wait until the last minute to get the online done, then wish their favorite PS3 games were put on the PS5 just for the sake of having free online gameplay. I personally don't care about the free online gameplay. I'll pay for it. I just want to play my favourite games on the new console because it feels better and sleeker, and gets alot more players.

Is Xbox deleting themselves from the console families? Ridiculous. Are users here deliberately trying to get offended by everything these days? Both MS and Sony have confirmed they are working on the next gen consoles. The cloud thing is already up and running, and is not even remotely a replacement for the new consoles. Knowing MS they would try something against the wishes of Xbox fans. Total digital with a Netflix type gaming service. No more hard copies. Sony is a little more traditional I think. um, no.

It's weird. I wish I hated Sony so I could understand the ridiculous thoughts that lead them to saying dumb crap, but unfortunately I'm an Xbox fan who will happily buy a PS4. Like, you know these fools had a major identity crisis when the X came out. ""It's the best console, BUT I MUST KEEP LICKING SONY'S SACK AS THE GODS DEMAND!"" It's like the cross-play situation. They were literally praising anti-consumerism so their beloved Sony didn't get bad press, which they got anyway because of said anti-consumerism. This all happen while they whine about a single event by Microsoft and claim it as ""anti-consumer."" (Not saying it wasn't!) Wtf? The only people who had an 'identity crisis', as you so eloquently put it, were in the MS camp. Sony fans never cared, and no intelligent consumer was going to go buy another $500 box to play their current library that wasn't even guaranteed to make use of the new box. The MS camp though has been reassuring themselves quite feverishly since, buyers remorse running thick like molasses at this point. Secondly, your lack of knowledge is showing here. Sony has had cross play for years now and even tried to reach out to MS, though was denied. This is a fact you cannot ignore. Just because it wasn't cross play on ONE game doesn't mean they didn't have it. Now all of a sudden MS makes a big deal out of it and there's the bad press. Shows how mature Sony's PR team is and how immature MS' is. Finally, TC isn't wrong. MS does want to get out of the console family business. They've said it themselves and even based the Xbox 1 (remember, all in one) on that ideology. If anyone moves away from physical media and traditional consoles first it will be them to try and 'lead the future'. They are primed for it since they keep failing in a traditional format.

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== Im on the record. Im calling my shot right now.

178887127979,10/9/2018,http://gaminghardware0.tumblr.com/post/178887127979,"Microsoft has announced its own online game streaming service: Project xCloud. The gaming world is changing, and we’ve seen the likes of Blade’s Shadow, Nvidia’s GeForce Now, Playstation Now, and even Google Chrome’s own browser-based streaming solution gain traction over the last year. And now Microsoft, the PC and console giant, will join the list of hopeful tech companies fighting for streaming supremacy. While technically an Xbox streaming service, Microsoft has been set on opening up its gaming library to more devices than just its own proprietary hardware as of late - with Windows PCs some of the first to benefit. This move looks to be similarly targeting the platform boundaries we’ve been locked behind for so long, instead opening up the Xbox library to more devices than the company’s dedicated hardware can reach alone. Project xCloud will use custom server rack hardware to power the experience - all based on existing Xbox One console components. That means custom AMD GPUs and accompanying memory will be the workhorse keeping Microsoft’s cloud gaming servers ticking over. This looks to be a big win for AMD - most cloud servers we’ve run into so far have employed Nvidia graphics cards for the grunt work rather than team red’s tech.

I don’t have a data cap either but your provider will throttle the s*** outta you if you start streaming games. Want proof? Tether your phone to your console and see how far you get playing a game. I’ll be surprised if it’s even playable. Definitely playable. I relied on smartphone tethering for quite some time for all of my home devices, including games and consoles, and it worked great. In fact the speeds I've gotten on my phone have been much better than the average home broadband connection in the US. Taken from howtogeek.com : “The most important thing holding back cloud gaming is internet speed. You need a fast, stable internet connection to take advantage of cloud gaming. Ideally, you’ll need a consistent 50 Mbps downstream speed, and that’s if you’re not sharing that speed with others. Having two people playing games at the same time, or having someone else streaming video in the other room, eats into that speed.” You must have the most wonderful provider in the world cause with sprint, I ideally max at about 30-31. Ideally. Ping is another big issue with this service. I avg about 35-40 on my connection and PSNow gives me lag because of my ping. I've gotten over 100mbps downstream on Verizon 4G, with pings as low as 30ms with 5ms jitter. Of course, it will be highly dependent on signal quality, tower load, etc. Edit: also, the bandwidth usage of online gaming are grossly overstated by most. Generally playing a game online won't use more than about 2mbps of total bandwidth. Even Netflix maxes out at around 30mbps of bandwidth for its highest quality stream, iirc.",,Solis,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Only microsoft does that because they use better specs. And look at how well it is going for them. The one time Sony trief to surpasd MS with hardware (ps3) the price tag skyrocketed and even if the hardware was marginally better it was a hassle for devs to squeeze the juice. Taking into account inflation and the cost of phones these days plus the success of the pro I reckon they'll release a basic for 499 and a 'plus' model for 599 to 649. Just a hunch.

178855660532,10/8/2018,http://reuters-com-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/178855660532,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is testing a new game streaming service called Project xCloud that is designed to work across PCs, consoles and mobile devices, the company said on Monday.
 Public trials for Project xCloud would begin in 2019, Microsoft said.
 “We are testing Project xCloud today. The test runs on devices (mobile phones, tablets) paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller through Bluetooth, and it is also playable using touch input,” Kareem Choudhry, corporate vice president, gaming cloud, said in a blog post.
 The service will compete with Google’s “Project Stream”, a game streaming service that is being tested by the Alphabet Inc unit in partnership with game publisher Ubisoft.
 Microsoft’s xCloud will also face competition from other popular streaming services including Nvidia’s GeForce Now and Sony’s PlayStation Now among others.

It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== If anything Sony needs to design their control more similar to X1. Microsoft's design has been superior to DS since 360. I'd prefer them to take a hard look at not just Microsoft's design but also Scuff controls. DS4's currently create deadzones in certain genres like shooters. Scuff design would allow you to do actions in a FPS without taking your finger off the analogs which makes a huge difference. You can do things like jump, aim, then shoot better rather than jumping taking your thumbs off analog and not being able to aim properly. Even using different control schemes placing jumps on RS can't really beat Scuff's design. I should not have to feel like my controls are ever a detriment to playing a game especially in competitive moments. Placing extra triggers in the back of the control is smart design. I'd also like them to be a little bigger. DS3/DS4 are too small. They might want to look at Control Freeks too. I find this make Sony's analogs way better and they definitely give more precision in shooters not to mention they're more ergonomic by a mile. Higher raised analogs is proven to give more precision to the player. Not sure if I'd rather convex or concave as I tend to like both for different reasons. My Freeks actually have a lower rise on the left stick and a higher rise on the right for aiming. It feels much smoother. One is concave and the other is convex. Concave is probably overall better design ergonomically speaking. Their control would be fit well for all genres. I'd like the triggers to be slightly longer. Bumper buttons are fine maybe make them a little fatter. Overall control needs to be bigger regardless. Feels like I can crush a DS4 in my hands easily but DS3 was much worse. I hated the DS3 with a passion. Use to give me hand cramps due to how small it was in my hands. DS4 design is way ahead of DS3. i never got tired hands playing on one.",,deuce985,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

Both companies have hurdles to cross (or are already crossing them now), just a similar yet also different set of them. ​ Azure in general will be far FAR larger than Sony's current game streaming service...but while Azure is HUGE, it's used for a variety of services. There will be some trade-offs between both MS and Sony's implementation of it, but I believe MS has the better foundation here.

You’re isolating people with data caps and less than stellar internet service. Things like thi would work for smaller games. I don’t think anything from 6th gen up would work on anything but the fastest connections. It's an option... not a requirement. A traditional system will be released along side any ""Streaming Only"" consoles that MS releases. SpikeTheSpaceCo WINS! FATALITY! Look at it this way, I can be playing a game on my NextBox, have to go to work, save my game and have it upload to The Cloud then whip out my phone on the bus and continue from exactly where I was using Streaming, save my progress and then get right back to my new save point and progress when I get home to my Console. And you win at not looking at the big picture. What game are you gonna play on your current gen system and then play on your phone? Your phone service provider would rape you over those data charges. Not to mention most console games control like ass on a smartphone. Playing FF6 on my iPhone is a lesson in patience. @SpikeTheSpaceCo this is the direction hardware companies are heading. They hate having to invest in hardware as that usually nets them little to no money for a few years.

If you're not going to purchase a PS5 because it doesn't have BC with PS4, then it suggests that you'd rather play PS4 games over new gen PS5 games.... In that case, why not keep your PS4 and keep playing your PS4 games. Let's be honest, there's no way you are going to plough through your PS4 backlog then if you are not doing so now..... When the new gen PS5 games with eye melting graphics at 4k 30 or 60fps debuts, you will want to play that instead. I get it, we buy lots of games on sales, digitally etc and we don't play them, we build that backlog and eventually try to justify why we would play them if we could only do so on the new platform, but we still don't, for the most part.... Every gen people just move on.... When you see the new gen games, it's over. Not saying people don't play old games, but the ratio is simply not even remotely as high as people believe or tout.... while i agree with you somewhat, its more of a principle, convenience thing and not wanting to get ripped off I can look over lack of PS3 bc because of very real tech limitations, but there are no valid excuses to skip ps4 bc other than greediness Hell i could understand not having ps4 bc at launch if they want to focus on the ps5 os and launch games with a commitment to bring ps4 bc in the near future, what i absolutely can't forgive is them making PS4 BC exclusive to their PSNow service or some greedy-ass move like that Senhua said: Day one if bc with ps1-3 & psp-vita. Ps5 pro if only bc with ps4. Cannot wait to replay all 9 SMT and personas games on ps1-2 I doubt they will add disc bc for ps1 and ps2 considering they would want to make money of psclassics PS3 is the wild card, i assume it will take a considerable effort and money to build a ps3 emu, not sure sony will consider it worth the money.

Imagine playing Xbox games on your PlayStation, well that is happening sooner than later, with public trials by Microsoft starting in 2019 for their Project xCloud system, check it out below: Dubbed Project xCloud, it’s designed to work across consoles, PCs, and even mobile devices. “Scaling and building out Project xCloud is a multi-year journey for us,” explains Microsoft’s cloud gaming chief Kareem Choudhry . [/b]“We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations.”[/b] Microsoft has built custom hardware for its datacenters, as The Verge previously exclusively reported, so that existing and future Xbox games will be compatible with the services. Games will be streamed to devices, and Microsoft has been testing the xCloud service with Xbox wireless controllers connected to consoles, mobile devices, and PCs. Microsoft says its research teams are “creating ways to combat latency” via advanced network techniques combined with video encoding and decoding. This should make game streaming viable on 4G networks, too. Public trials of the service will begin next year, and Microsoft’s Xbox game streaming service will face competition from a variety of existing services. The most popular include GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Microsoft’s xCloud unveiling comes just days after Google announced its own Project Stream service that will let testers play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop. Microsoft isn’t revealing exactly what it’s doing differently than the competition, but we’ll find out more details when public testing starts in 2019. Click to expand... So what do you think? - Is dedicated console gaming finally coming to its death? - Is this the wave of the future, now with WiFi 6 recently announced, which also is starting in 2019 and it promises less lag, and more people having gigabit internet in their homes, we might just be nailing down the coffin shut finally on are be-loved consoles, so use them while you can, as death is staying over them! Project xCloud: Gaming with you at the center NEWS SOURCE: Microsoft’s xCloud service streams Xbox games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices (via) TheVerge ====================::==================== GaryOPA said: ↑ Netflix does it all the time removing full seasons and movies get purged all the time on yearly or quarterly basis. Welcome to the era of book burning! Click to expand... True, but there may be differences here. Which raises another question. What is the pay structure going to look like? Netflix, you aren't paying for access to specific shows. You're paying for general access to their service and all content. IF that is the model Microsoft goes with, if might not be so bad, so long as the cost is reasonable and fair. But I suspect it's going to be more insidious. If not flat out making you pay for each game individually at retail price (which I'm sure will be the end goal at some point), then I'm willing to bet there will be tiers. With new releases and AAA titles being reserved to the highest price tier, and older titles and lesser titles will be in the lower cost tiers. I can see no end to the ways they can screw with the end users. Pay structure based on playback device. IE: Playing on a phone using the phone's touch screen instead of a xbox one controller. Since that would suggest that you would need to be playing through a specifically programmed front end. Cross platform surcharge. ""Forza 7 detected PS4 - copyright royalty surcharge applied. See user agreement for details on cross platform surcharges."" Oh wait, I know,. ""Halo detected Wii - Programming surcharge for actually making us have to write a front end for kiddy platform we despise"". Doesn't matter.

Public trials for Project xCloud would begin in 2019, Microsoft said.

“We are testing Project xCloud today. The test runs on devices (mobile phones, tablets) paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller through Bluetooth, and it is also playable using touch input,” Kareem Choudhry, corporate vice president, gaming cloud, said in a blog post.

The service will compete with Google’s “Project Stream”, a game streaming service that is being tested by the Alphabet Inc unit in partnership with game publisher Ubisoft.

Microsoft’s xCloud will also face competition from other popular streaming services including Nvidia’s GeForce Now and Sony’s PlayStation Now among others.

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== gencid said: ↑ sean9986 said: ↑ Sony didn’t update the controller till ps4, probably won’t be updating it again for a while Click to expand... They shouldn't update what is proven to work well and even when they more radically updated it for PS4, I still think they should have left the analog sticks alone. PSX - a more ergonomic SNES controller with better D-Pad and dual bumpers Dual Shock - added twin stick, rumble and enabler button once Nintendo proved that the stick works better than D-Pad for 3D games and rumble was a great controller innovation Dual Shock 2 - made all buttons pressure sensitive which was essentially controller sex if it wasn't for the cord that kept the controller still tethered to the console Sixaxis - made Dual Shock 2 wireless, added 3 dimensional motion controls, turned the lower bumpers into trigger buttons (thanks a lot MS) but removed rumble due to lawsuit Dual Shock 3 - added rumble back to Sixaxis after it settled the lawsuit and if it weren't for the lower bumpers (triggers), it would have been potentially the best controller of all time Dual Shock 4 - adjusted controller ergonomics, swapped the perfect convex analog sticks with terrible concave ones, fixed the triggers, added touch pad thanks to the WiiU, had LEDs on the controller as to not give up unattractive motion controls which ate the controller battery life and renamed Start and Select menu buttons to Options and Share. Dual Shock 4 Pro - fixed the reliability of the analog sticks even though they are still worse than Dual Shock 3 and made part of the touch pad see-through for a sexier look So I guess you were mostly right about Sony not drastically changing their controller until PS4, but considering that the change brought significant downgrades in addition to some not very significant upgrades, I would actually rather them not change the controllers again and just improve on past screw ups which in 2018 would mean to change the sticks back to convex, minimize the real estate that a mostly useless touch pad takes, and either remove the LED lights from the controller or have an option to turn them ON or OFF, with the default option being OFF. Click to expand... I think the Led is there for vr so they can’t remove it. Basically yeah just make improvements. Battery life and the triggers. My triggers squeak when I press them. They’re so cheaply made",,sean9986,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

The mid-gen updates of these consoles will mean that next gen will be even more underwhelming as far as graphics are concerned. I think that the next gen will be known for the first with a truly mobile experience. I don't mean mobile hardware, it's the experience that will be mobile. There have already been some ground gained in this direction with the Switch and Microsoft's play anywhere initiative. Nintendo will double down on their approach with a home console that you can take anywhere and build out from the base that the Switch has started. MS with their streaming initiative will enable Xbox to be played on lots of different devices, possibly other companies consoles (Xbox app on Switch could be something that could happen). Google and Amazon will enter the market with their own streaming services available over a wide range of devices. Sony will probably build on PSnow to offer brand new titles like GamePass. Mobile 4G and 5G carriers will begin to compete with wired internet providers by offering attractive alternatives with differentiation between download data caps and unlimited streaming. There will still be standard consoles but by the end of the gen a boxless streaming console service will be something that is accepted as a viable alternative by the mass market.

Read on see why the patent could suggest we could be getting the ability to play our PS4, PS3, PS2 and PS1 games on the Playstation 5. The patent was filed privately before, probably as a placeholder, but updated on October 2nd, 2018. The patent titled “Remastering by emulation” is registered to Sony Interactive Entertainment America LLC, the parent company of the Playstation brand. As summary of the patent is as follows: Each asset such as a texture called for by legacy software such as a legacy computer game software has a unique identifier associated with it. The unique identifier can be rendered by imposing a hash on the asset, and then the asset stored with its identifier in a data structure. An artist remasters the textures for presentation on a higher resolution display than envisioned in the original software, and stores them back in the data structure with their identifiers. The original software is then played on the higher resolution display, with asset (such as texture) calls being intercepted, identified, and the data structure entered to retrieve the remastered asset having a matching identifier. The remastered asset is then inserted on the fly into the game presentation. Sounds awfully like Backward Compatibility doesn’t it? It also seems to suggest that Sony will be foregoing the “Remaster” route that they went will the PS5. The Xbox One is held in high regard due to its massive support of Xbox and Xbox 360 games, with Sony going the same route with the PS5, it’ll only be beneficial for us gamers. Recent rumors have been suggesting that Sony is working on a lot of things for the PS5, the PSN for example is said to be upgraded. Developers too have been making comments on what they want from the PS5 and Xbox Scarlett notably more memory and storage. What do you think of the rumor? Could this patent be about the PS5 having Backward Compatibility? Let us know in the comments. ====================::==================== Originally Posted by Tech614 PS5 will definitely have BC with PS4. Pretty good chance with PS2 and PS1 as well.(the real question is how they do it, IE the right way like PS3 OG did with discs playing or if only digital copies work, or even worse they make you rebuy versions with trophies like current PS2 classics on PS4). PS3, I still think that is more of a tossup and really depends on if Sony wants to devote programming resources that could help actually making game to one by one recompile each game similar to what you see with 360 games on XBO as there is no way they are sticking a cell in the PS5(lol @ the guy who said that btw). I think the PS5 will have disk BC with PS1/2 and clearly PS4 but like I said you said the PS3 BC is up in the air. There is many ways they could go about it even more so when they got PSNow and could just go the MS way with that. Also I fully agree there is no chance in hell Sony would put a Cell Processor in the PS5 and that would require the Mobo to be a duel CPU mobo. Making the system cost a fuck ton of money. Things we know right now of the PS5 that is fact. 1) It will be $400 2) It won't have a cell processor in it LOlL",,Jtbrig7390,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,[Rumor] Sony patent hints at PS5 backwards compatability,,,

Frustrated players had become wary of paying $40 for the 3rd expansion called Destiny 2: Forsaken. Bungie has seen the writing on the wall and made the decision to bundle the Destiny 2 Expansion Pass content with Destiny 2: Forsaken starting October 16th. Owners of the Expansion Pass will receive compensation in the form of an emblem, shader, emotes, and consumables. Only the emblem and shader will be exclusive as the emotes can be earned later on. Launching a game reveals what we did right and where we could have done better. With the first month of Forsaken behind us, we're taking stock of what we've learned. Some of those learnings will manifest in game updates that we're deploying in the very near future, but not every improvement can be made with code changes. We also want to make it less complicated for other Guardians to begin their journey in Forsaken. Effective October 16, the purchase of Destiny 2: Forsaken will include the two expansions included in the Destiny 2 Expansion Pass. Every player of Destiny 2 who has yet to touch down on the Tangled Shore will need only the Forsaken upgrade. Our hope is that this will eliminate some of the questions that confront a player as they try to join our party. ====================::==================== Wasn't this a 10 year game cycle...oh well at least we are already half over the bullshit anyways. The whirlwind of Destiny 1 was okay, I played the hell out of it, through all the nerfs. It was fun. I did not buy Destiny 2, it was a free game on PSnow just a month ago or so...wont be playing the expansion. I may download it and see what all is being held back without the expansion.",,Viper16,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,Bungie Bundles Older Expansion Pass Content with Forsaken DLC,,,

Solis posted... uptown710 posted... I don’t have a data cap either but your provider will throttle the s*** outta you if you start streaming games. Want proof? Tether your phone to your console and see how far you get playing a game. I’ll be surprised if it’s even playable. Definitely playable. I relied on smartphone tethering for quite some time for all of my home devices, including games and consoles, and it worked great. In fact the speeds I've gotten on my phone have been much better than the average home broadband connection in the US. Taken from howtogeek.com : “The most important thing holding back cloud gaming is internet speed. You need a fast, stable internet connection to take advantage of cloud gaming. Ideally, you’ll need a consistent 50 Mbps downstream speed, and that’s if you’re not sharing that speed with others. Having two people playing games at the same time, or having someone else streaming video in the other room, eats into that speed.” You must have the most wonderful provider in the world cause with sprint, I ideally max at about 30-31. Ideally. Ping is another big issue with this service. I avg about 35-40 on my connection and PSNow gives me lag because of my ping. I've gotten over 100mbps downstream on Verizon 4G, with pings as low as 30ms with 5ms jitter. Of course, it will be highly dependent on signal quality, tower load, etc. Edit: also, the bandwidth usage of online gaming are grossly overstated by most. Generally playing a game online won't use more than about 2mbps of total bandwidth. Even Netflix maxes out at around 30mbps of bandwidth for its highest quality stream, iirc. That’s playing a game. Streaming it is completely different. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/56knv8/how_much_bandwidth_does_playstation_now_use/#ampf=undefined These guys are pulling 100s of gigs a month. On games that are 4 years old. Right, but the article you referred to was specifically referring to playing games online, not streaming them. And 100s of gigs per month for streaming is actually pretty modest; even at 10mbps (which seems to be a fairly decent estimate for Playstation Now streaming, and is also the number that Project Xcloud is targeting), that would only require 20 hours of usage to reach 100GB of data use. The age of the games is also completely irrelevant, as the age of what's being streamed has no bearing on its data usage.",,Solis,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

 * The online service will stream the game from remote cloud servers to the user’s device, removing the need for high-powered consoles or gaming computers. 
 * Project xCloud doesn’t have a release date yet, but it will likely launch with new Xbox devices designed specifically for streaming. 
Microsoft has officially announced Project xCloud, a new video game streaming service that could bring the next generation of video games to mobile devices around the world.

Backed by the company’s Azure Cloud computing service, Project xCloud aims to remove the need for expensive home consoles or gaming PCs to play high-quality video games.

Based on the announcement, Project xCloud would allow players to stream some of Microsoft’s most well-known titles including “Halo,” “Gears of War,” “Forza” and “Minecraft.” Microsoft said the thousands of developers currently working on Xbox titles will be able to use Project xCloud as well.

The service supports Xbox One controllers via Bluetooth but also allows touchscreen controls on tablets and smartphones. A handy peripheral that clips a smartphone on top of an Xbox Controller can create a portable setup for high-end gaming. In a statement attached to the Project xCloud announcement, Microsoft said Project xCloud will be functional on 4G and 5G mobile data networks.

Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s executive vice president of gaming, teased the new streaming service at E3 in June 2018. In an interview with Business Insider after Microsoft’s keynote speech, Spencer said the company wants to reach gamers on whatever platform they choose to play on. Microsoft’s Azure Cloud service is available in 140 countries and Project xCloud could greatly reduce the technological barrier of entry for gaming.

“There are 2 billion people who play video games on the planet today. We’re not going to sell 2 billion consoles,” Spencer said.

For now, it’s not clear whether Xbox owners will be able to carry their games and subscriptions over to Project xCloud, but Microsoft says developers will be able to stream their new games through Project xCloud with no additional effort. 

As Xbox One sales lag behind those of the PlayStation 4, Microsoft has shown a continued interest in offering subscription services like the Xbox Game Pass and Xbox All Access to its users.

Microsoft isn’t the only company interested in streaming video games either. Google announced its own “Project Stream” last week, with the goal of bringing blockbuster video games straight to the Google Chrome browser. The Project Stream beta test will include just one game, Ubisoft’s recently released “Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey.” Sony, Microsoft’s primary competitor in the console gaming market, has its own streaming service in PlayStation Now.  PlayStation Now was once available on smart TVs and handheld devices but is currently limited to computers and the PlayStation 4 console. PC gaming company Nvidia unveiled their own streaming service in 2015, called GeForce Now, but the service remains in open beta after testing multiple subscription models. 

Project xCloud doesn’t have a release date yet, but Microsoft is planning a public trial for 2019. Rumors suggest that Microsoft will launch one or two new Xbox devices in 2020 to make use of Project xCloud’s streaming capabilities.

Solis posted... uptown710 posted... I don’t have a data cap either but your provider will throttle the s*** outta you if you start streaming games. Want proof? Tether your phone to your console and see how far you get playing a game. I’ll be surprised if it’s even playable. Definitely playable. I relied on smartphone tethering for quite some time for all of my home devices, including games and consoles, and it worked great. In fact the speeds I've gotten on my phone have been much better than the average home broadband connection in the US. Taken from howtogeek.com : “The most important thing holding back cloud gaming is internet speed. You need a fast, stable internet connection to take advantage of cloud gaming. Ideally, you’ll need a consistent 50 Mbps downstream speed, and that’s if you’re not sharing that speed with others. Having two people playing games at the same time, or having someone else streaming video in the other room, eats into that speed.” You must have the most wonderful provider in the world cause with sprint, I ideally max at about 30-31. Ideally. Ping is another big issue with this service. I avg about 35-40 on my connection and PSNow gives me lag because of my ping. I've gotten over 100mbps downstream on Verizon 4G, with pings as low as 30ms with 5ms jitter. Of course, it will be highly dependent on signal quality, tower load, etc. Edit: also, the bandwidth usage of online gaming are grossly overstated by most. Generally playing a game online won't use more than about 2mbps of total bandwidth. Even Netflix maxes out at around 30mbps of bandwidth for its highest quality stream, iirc. That’s playing a game. Streaming it is completely different. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/56knv8/how_much_bandwidth_does_playstation_now_use/#ampf=undefined These guys are pulling 100s of gigs a month. On games that are 4 years old. Throw in your day to day data usage and TV streaming. Your ISP will wither throttle the crap out of you are find a way to make you pay for it.

This is one of areas that no other competition can match. Its financially impossible for Sony to build & operate data centers around the world, which is why they use Amazon Servers. Not to mention that PSNow is much more limited in game selection & tied to subscription & limited to PS4 & PC. Microsoft xcloud is going to target any devices that has bluetooth connection or touch screen. Any Xbox games you own digitally can be streamed. Offers alternative touch screen controls if controller is not present. Game Streaming service will have a fierce competition. My prediction is that it will be between Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple(?). nvidia & AMD will have smaller pieces of pie.

Microsoft says its currently testing out Project xCloud and plans to open up tests to the public next year. In a blog post, the company said that game developers will be able to support the streaming service with no additional work, and that in addition to trying to solve the big ol latency problem (with Microsofts many datacenters), the team is developing a new, game-specific touch input overlay for controller-free playing. Our goal with Project xCloud is to deliver a quality experience for all gamers on all devices thats consistent with the speed and high-fidelity gamers experience and expect on their PCs and consoles, the company said.

First impressions are that there is some definite input lag, can't put a number on how much, but it's noticeable, like playing with that one friend that always had shit internet but for some reason was always hosting your CoD:MW2 lobbies ^((I promise I'm not still bitter)). I've ruled it out from being my internet or PC since I have 150mbps down and 10mbps up, along side an i3-8350k @ 4.8GHz and a 1080, CPU usage sat at 40% while playing, so if you were on a lower clocked dual core it probably wouldn't be the greatest experience. So I think it's just the nature of game streaming, it's much better than that time I tried to play Rise of the Tomb Raider using Steam In-home Streaming on my phone though. Bottom line is, it's playable, much more playable than I expected for streaming a game. If you have a PS4 already, just play BB on it, no point of going for an inferior experience, but if you know you'll never end up getting a PS4 or you are away from your PS4 and want to play some BB, download it and get your free trial for a week, more than enough time to complete it.",,Mypetrussian,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Games like NGS wont be made in a streaming only future. I think that adding 50ms or so of lag ontop of current lag wont hurt most player’s experiences in games built around thise limitations.

If it is better than something like Playstation Now was, that would be alright. I tried that out twice, and was never that impressed. My internet is respectable, so I doubt that was the issue. i'll be curious to see where this goes. Click to expand... The beta gamers on Nvidia streaming and Google’s project Streaming already have glowing reviews on it..and I can only imagine Microsoft’s version will be even better since they have put so much development time and money into this (It’s all better than psnow...while Sony was forward thinking in offering such a service first, they suffer from not investing in the tech at all, and being narrow in the service they offer. I like to think of it as like James Cameron being able to show people how awesome 3D movies can be...but unfortunately the glut of mediocre 3D conversion movies since have made people think 3D sucks/unnecessary. PsNow is the mediocre version of this tech, that is unfortunately causing corner gamers to shrug their shoulders at the idea) The latency and input lag is already down to the point where it doesn’t really matter. Microsoft will be offering a ~$100 box with their next gen stuff that has hardware in it to do half the work and make latency/input lag close to zero for those who really are sensitive to it. But honestly, gamers who game on consoles and hdtv’s have already conditioned themselves to put up with input lag (compared to pc/monitor gaming). It’s all relative. The majority of mainstream gamers will see streaming as the better option. Any drawbacks that core/hardcore see it streaming...really won’t matter. Streaming games at top of the line hardware quality on cheap old hardware is better than spending $400-$500 for less input lag...hardware that will eventually get old. With streaming, the games upgrade on the servers and you don’t have to upgrade hardware at home (or on the go) I mean, you tell the casual mainstream gamer all they have to do is pay $100 for the Xbox streaming box in order to play cyberpunk2077 at full ultra quality? As well as all other games? And never have to worry about upgrading? It will be the best option for most Click to expand... Link? Proof? Because I call bullshit on this generalization. I play on both and I'm sensitive to input lag.

However, Sony president Kenichiro Yoshida recently said in an interview that “a next-generation hardware” is necessary. “At this point, what I can say is it’s necessary to have a next-generation hardware,” Yoshida told the Financial Times . Unfortunately, he declined to outright say that the successor to the PlayStation 4 will be called the PlayStation 5. Although details on this next-generation console have not been officially revealed, at least everyone now knows for certain that Sony is indeed working on it. The Financial Times’ sources indicate that the upcoming new console may not have a major departure from the PS4. What that exactly means remains unclear, but it’s said that the “fundamental architecture would be similar.” There are currently three versions of the PS4: the original “fat” PS4, the PS4 Slim and the PS4 Pro. There have been countless rumors and speculations regarding the PS5. In August, Ace Economic Research Institute analyst Hideki Yasuda said that the PS5 will most likely arrive sometime in 2019. In April, SemiAccurate reported that the PS5 could come out as early as 2018 and that development kits for the console have already been sent to some game developers. Meanwhile, Kotaku was able to interview dozens of game developers , including two people who are allegedly familiar with Sony’s plans. The sources all said that it’s unlikely that Sony will release the PS5 in 2018 or even in 2019. This has led to speculations that the upcoming next-generation console might arrive in 2020. The PlayStation 4 launched in 2013 and is already five years old. Sony’s consoles typically have a lifecycle of around six years, as pointed out by GameSpot . The six-year gap holds true for the original PlayStation and the PS2. However, the gap between the PS3 and PS4 was seven years. Gaming has changed significantly in the last five years and the advancement of CPU and GPU technology is getting faster than ever before. Streaming has also made a huge impact on gaming and Sony is already serving up streamable games through its PlayStation Now service. Meanwhile, Microsoft has already confirmed that the same team responsible for the Xbox One X is working on the console's successor. “The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer said, according to Eurogamer .

I've seen too many threads derail in the past. Hopefully we can keep the positivity going here. I started playing my Switch only cause I got Disgaea 1 complete in yesterday. I played the PS2 version a LOT many years ago. I solo'd Laharl but this time I'm using a few characters...well, for now. That's something the Wii U needed...a Disgaea game. They can get out of hand, depending on how you play, but I believe the gamepad could have been utilized in an awesome fashion during battles. Perhaps a different top down map? Who knows, just a thought. No problem :). The thing is I've barely moved onto the Switch, I don't think it lives up to the Wii U or 3DS, or almost any of Nintendo's past consoles, that's a big reason why I am still lingering on this board, wishing Nintendo was like it was before. Right now I'm mostly playing PSNow on PC, Darksiders to be specific, and also a version of FF VII Crisis Core. I do still somewhat use my Switch, but its only to casually play Infinite Minigolf, a game that is on all platforms including PC and PC VR. I just pretty much ran out of stuff to do on the Wii U that I was really interested in. I still had some minor stuff to do in Hyrule Warriors Wii U before I stopped playing it, and though many times I don't come back to games after this long of not playing them, I suppose there is still some chance I come back to it. I also was playing the 3DS version at the same time, but still had a decent amount of stuff to do on there, I just got burnt out from playing both versions at the same time with both being so similar. Mario Maker is another game I have some chance of putting more time into as well, since it is decent and I didn't put much time into it. Even though I really enjoyed the New 3DS, I was mostly into Nintendo for the consoles, and without them I don't think they really are at the same standard they use to be (especially with stuff like the port situation on the Switch). This has left me with a hole that is hard to fill, but at least I still have the Wii U message board lol.",,Mozzezz,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Not to mention most console games control like ass on a smartphone. Playing FF6 on my iPhone is a lesson in patience. @SpikeTheSpaceCo this is the direction hardware companies are heading. They hate having to invest in hardware as that usually nets them little to no money for a few years. And I say you’re isolating people because the streaming service will probably offer titles that you can’t get on a current physical based console (I remember some games on PSNow not being available on the PSN). You do understand that you can use your Wi-Fi... I only have one console, and the idea that I can connect to my Wi-Fi, go upstairs to bed and still play my game in the comfort of my bed sounds great. I don't understand how people can moan about MS given gamers, you, another option and way to play your games. You either use it or don't... Some people... ‍♂ Skips where I said I used PSNow apprently. On my wi-fi... gasp. Please point out where I say “I hope nobody gets the opportunity to use this”. Gonna have trouble doing so. I stated that current internet infrastructure isn’t ready for this. Something a lot of people who’ve dabbled in game streaming have proven true.

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service.

Despite your “high ping” complaint? Click to expand... Uh you should probably learn how it all works first. The ""latencies"" all get added up. The cloud server is talking to the game server, then the cloud server talks to you. It is another pipe for traffic to go through before it gets to you. Its fine for single player games that dont require any twitch movement. But games like Rocket League or Overwatch don't even stream reliably enough to be able to compete on a home network, with your own PC as a streaming server. As you get better at the games, they get harder to play too. The control delay is just too much. Click to expand... Yet, Rocket league is very popular on Switch isnt it? Click to expand... Stop. You do not know what you are talking about. You do not stream games to the Switch over the internet. Do you even know what streaming is? Unless you understand latency (not internet download speed, latency), network traffic, and why competitive games like Rocket League, Overwatch, etc are PHYSICALLY impossible to stream competitively on a massive scale (we simply dont have the infrastructure), why even respond? Rocket League is popular on Switch... what does that have to do with absolutely anything? You could have posted anything, about anything and it would have made just as much sense. ====================::==================== phantomnx said: ↑ deuce985 said: ↑ phantomnx said: ↑ The beta gamers on Nvidia streaming and Google’s project Streaming already have glowing reviews on it..and I can only imagine Microsoft’s version will be even better since they have put so much development time and money into this (It’s all better than psnow...while Sony was forward thinking in offering such a service first, they suffer from not investing in the tech at all, and being narrow in the service they offer. I like to think of it as like James Cameron being able to show people how awesome 3D movies can be...but unfortunately the glut of mediocre 3D conversion movies since have made people think 3D sucks/unnecessary. PsNow is the mediocre version of this tech, that is unfortunately causing corner gamers to shrug their shoulders at the idea) The latency and input lag is already down to the point where it doesn’t really matter. Microsoft will be offering a ~$100 box with their next gen stuff that has hardware in it to do half the work and make latency/input lag close to zero for those who really are sensitive to it. But honestly, gamers who game on consoles and hdtv’s have already conditioned themselves to put up with input lag (compared to pc/monitor gaming). It’s all relative. The majority of mainstream gamers will see streaming as the better option. Any drawbacks that core/hardcore see it streaming...really won’t matter. Streaming games at top of the line hardware quality on cheap old hardware is better than spending $400-$500 for less input lag...hardware that will eventually get old. With streaming, the games upgrade on the servers and you don’t have to upgrade hardware at home (or on the go) I mean, you tell the casual mainstream gamer all they have to do is pay $100 for the Xbox streaming box in order to play cyberpunk2077 at full ultra quality?

Is that what you are asking a source on? lol I mean, you just have to look at how casual/mainstream consumers consume to know this is true lol They will always choose convenience/cheaper for their media consumption even if it means not getting absolutely fidelity. This has always happened, this will always happen. As far as specifically to mainstream/casual gamers...we’ve seen them perfectly fine putting up with latency in online gaming, accepting sub native resolutions, perfectly fine with sub optimal and inconsistent frame rated, doesn’t really care about needing the best iq in their gaming etc...

Of course, the other option would be to grab a copy of Sumerset, which includes that expansion and the base game and if if you get completely into the game and finish all that content (which is a lot) then sign up for ESO PLUS and get access to all dlc released so far, including the upcoming Murkmire next month. As far as I know, when it comes to PSNOW, yes, your characters and such will still be on Zenimaxs servers, so you can continue where you left off.

Google and Xbox just started the next platform war

Game streaming is coming. It’s been coming since before we all laughed at OnLive and ignored PlayStation Now, and those too-little-too-soon gambits did nothing to impede its inevitable arrival. It is the future, in the sense that a credible and widely-used iteration of game streaming technology is around the corner and is something everyone…

Why no PS5 games on PS4? Because sony thinks “winning” is selling the most boxes... if winning is selling the most games they would release their Playstation exclusives games as a service so ipad / PC / xbox players can play them ... i think they will do that one day but not at the launch of the PS5. AI would become dumber not better. They will do more to save CPU and GPU use. In streaming they are paying now for that use remember. Single player would make less sense in a cloud compute world. Single player would be more costly. Why serve 15 players spinning up 15 CPUs worth of AI and physics in their own world instance when you can serve 15 players on 1 CPU having one world instance with shared physics in a battle royal game. You think this means more power for you when I see the economical reason why it means less as they try to save money and server stress while making the same monthly profit and owning the hardware. Xbox is only just starting installing XB1 blades and not xbox next blades. There would be no reason to install XB1 blades if they had next gen ones and wanted to give you more power. They aren't about increasing costs and giving you more power. They are about having another avenue to sell you what they already produce. Sony doesn't think any differently to MS, though its market position is different. 'Winning' isn't about selling boxes but making a profit which was why PSNow existed before any of these other streaming services. They don't think about selling boxes. However they see that they sell the most devices and that PSNow is not the main game seller and that means they will likely push boxes while offering the streaming service too alongside it.",,Three,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Imagine playing Xbox games on your PlayStation, well that is happening sooner than later, with public trials by Microsoft starting in 2019 for their Project xCloud system, check it out below: Dubbed Project xCloud, it’s designed to work across consoles, PCs, and even mobile devices. “Scaling and building out Project xCloud is a multi-year journey for us,” explains Microsoft’s cloud gaming chief Kareem Choudhry . [/b]“We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations.”[/b] Microsoft has built custom hardware for its datacenters, as The Verge previously exclusively reported, so that existing and future Xbox games will be compatible with the services. Games will be streamed to devices, and Microsoft has been testing the xCloud service with Xbox wireless controllers connected to consoles, mobile devices, and PCs. Microsoft says its research teams are “creating ways to combat latency” via advanced network techniques combined with video encoding and decoding. This should make game streaming viable on 4G networks, too. Public trials of the service will begin next year, and Microsoft’s Xbox game streaming service will face competition from a variety of existing services. The most popular include GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Microsoft’s xCloud unveiling comes just days after Google announced its own Project Stream service that will let testers play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop. Microsoft isn’t revealing exactly what it’s doing differently than the competition, but we’ll find out more details when public testing starts in 2019. Click to expand...

178859249881,10/8/2018,http://nikhilshakya5.tumblr.com/post/178859249881,"A patent filed by Sony suggests the company may be looking into backwards compatibility on newer consoles. The newly published patent, originally filed in November 2016, was titled “remastering by emulation.” It describes a method of spiffing up old games by remastering old textures on the fly.

Eurogamer reports that the full application explains how it could take files from “legacy software” and essentially replace them with higher-resolution assets, allowing the game to use the same framework while rendering better-looking textures or audio files. The result would essentially be the same as many remastered games we’ve seen with higher textures, but with significantly less work for developers.

“The original software is then played on the higher resolution display, with asset (such as texture) calls being intercepted, identified, and the data structure entered to retrieve the remastered asset having a matching identifier,” the application states. “The remastered asset is then inserted on the fly into the game presentation.”

It’s difficult to say just how this technology could manifest. Sony may be looking forward to the next generation of consoles like the PS5 and planning how it could allow backwards compatibility, or this could even be the tech currently applied to remasters.

Sony has shown disinterest in backwards compatibility as a feature. It introduced the PlayStation 3 with hardware-based backwards compatibility but then dropped it from later models. On PlayStation 4 it has never offered the feature, instead relying on services like PlayStation Now and standalone re-releases.

PlayStation Europe head Jim Ryan said last year that backwards compatibility is “one of those features that is much requested, but not actually used much.” Its competitor, Microsoft, introduced software-based backwards compatibility in 2015, and has been developing a growing list of available titles ever since. At the time, Sony exec Shuhei Yoshida said the development wouldn’t change its approach.

“Backward compatibility is hard,” Yoshida said. “I won’t say we’ll never do it, but it’s not an easy thing to do. If it was easy we would have done that.”

Thanks to services like NVIDIA GeForce Now and PlayStation Now, the gaming industry has been experimenting a lot with the act of streaming video games over an internet connection rather than running them locally on a console or PC. Now, the latest company to dip its toes in the streaming games market is Google.

They shouldn't update what is proven to work well and even when they more radically updated it for PS4, I still think they should have left the analog sticks alone. PSX - a more ergonomic SNES controller with better D-Pad and dual bumpers Dual Shock - added twin stick, rumble and enabler button once Nintendo proved that the stick works better than D-Pad for 3D games and rumble was a great controller innovation Dual Shock 2 - made all buttons pressure sensitive which was essentially controller sex if it wasn't for the cord that kept the controller still tethered to the console Sixaxis - made Dual Shock 2 wireless, added 3 dimensional motion controls, turned the lower bumpers into trigger buttons (thanks a lot MS) but removed rumble due to lawsuit Dual Shock 3 - added rumble back to Sixaxis after it settled the lawsuit and if it weren't for the lower bumpers (triggers), it would have been potentially the best controller of all time Dual Shock 4 - adjusted controller ergonomics, swapped the perfect convex analog sticks with terrible concave ones, fixed the triggers, added touch pad thanks to the WiiU, had LEDs on the controller as to not give up unattractive motion controls which ate the controller battery life and renamed Start and Select menu buttons to Options and Share. Dual Shock 4 Pro - fixed the reliability of the analog sticks even though they are still worse than Dual Shock 3 and made part of the touch pad see-through for a sexier look So I guess you were mostly right about Sony not drastically changing their controller until PS4, but considering that the change brought significant downgrades in addition to some not very significant upgrades, I would rather them not change the controllers again and just improve on past screw-ups which in 2018 would mean changing the sticks back to convex, minimize the real estate that a mostly useless touch pad takes, and either remove the LED lights from the controller or have an option to turn them ON/OFF, with the default option being OFF.",,gencid,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

178857471823,10/8/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/178857471823,"A patent filed by Sony suggests the company may be looking into backwards compatibility on newer consoles. The newly published patent, originally filed in November 2016, was titled “remastering by emulation.” It describes a method of spiffing up old games by remastering old textures on the fly.

Eurogamer reports that the full application explains how it could take files from “legacy software” and essentially replace them with higher-resolution assets, allowing the game to use the same framework while rendering better-looking textures or audio files. The result would essentially be the same as many remastered games we’ve seen with higher textures, but with significantly less work for developers.

“The original software is then played on the higher resolution display, with asset (such as texture) calls being intercepted, identified, and the data structure entered to retrieve the remastered asset having a matching identifier,” the application states. “The remastered asset is then inserted on the fly into the game presentation.”

It’s difficult to say just how this technology could manifest. Sony may be looking forward to the next generation of consoles like the PS5 and planning how it could allow backwards compatibility, or this could even be the tech currently applied to remasters.

Sony has shown disinterest in backwards compatibility as a feature. It introduced the PlayStation 3 with hardware-based backwards compatibility but then dropped it from later models. On PlayStation 4 it has never offered the feature, instead relying on services like PlayStation Now and standalone re-releases.

PlayStation Europe head Jim Ryan said last year that backwards compatibility is “one of those features that is much requested, but not actually used much.” Its competitor, Microsoft, introduced software-based backwards compatibility in 2015, and has been developing a growing list of available titles ever since. At the time, Sony exec Shuhei Yoshida said the development wouldn’t change its approach.

“Backward compatibility is hard,” Yoshida said. “I won’t say we’ll never do it, but it’s not an easy thing to do. If it was easy we would have done that.”",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,PlayStation Patent Suggests New Method For Remasters,Post,,

No internet can't play, and if my internet having routing issue to the game server also can't play, i can imagine how piss off i would be.[/quote] That is only true if it happens now just as if all of sudden games were only available digitally 5 years ago. Its not something that is gonna change from one day to another and in fact it all depends if it takes off or not. Consoles as I say aren't going anywhere for the time being but as much as we are against it we all have to face reality. The reality is that we belong to a small amount of gamers this days as those ""2 billion"" casual gamers and many other ones outnumber us by far. The reality is that a lot of consoles and game sales are from casual gamers and not from the hardcore anymore. Because of that the whole industry is shifting to that direction as there is tons of cash to be made. Look at games like PUBG, Fornite, Minecraft, Call of Duty and many others. We all agree that games such as God of War, Uncharted, Horizon Zero dawn, Forza Horizon 4, Gears, Monster Hunter World and many others are far better than those games but reality says otherwise as those games outnumber by far all those titles combined. [B]""If Sony refuses to join this game streaming route, Sony probably will be my most respected company.""[/B] Sony is actually the company that tried first this generation or are you forgetting about PSNow? that service hasn't been a success for Sony because they lack the infrastructure to pull this off properly. There are only 3 big players in this world capable of pulling that off and those are Google, Amazon and Microsoft and all the 3 are working on streaming services. As I say streaming is optional and is going to stay like that for a very long period of time i believe. Why is streaming that important? many countries around the globe have excellent internet connection and providing such a option is perfect for their needs. For instance @[USER=100781]Thanakil[/USER] spent 400 bucks i guess for a PS4 Pro just to play Red Dead Redemption 2 a game that sadly isn't on PC. Imagine if he had the type of mobile connection i have with up to 160mbits and unlimited? he may not agree now but i bet he would at least consider to use such a service and play the game on PC instead by streaming it if it works well and save money. Right now it sounds bad for us and in reality it has many downsides too but we shouldn't forget that we purchase digital games nowdays and no matter what we don't have any type of ownership on those games except the permanent use as long as the service they are tied on is available. Streaming isn't any different you just have the freedom to choose anytime where to play your games.",,@ruantec,,,,Negative,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,

(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is testing a new game streaming service called Project xCloud that is designed to work across PCs, consoles and mobile devices, the company said on Monday.

Public trials for Project xCloud would begin in 2019, Microsoft said.

“We are testing Project xCloud today. The test runs on devices (mobile phones, tablets) paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller through Bluetooth, and it is also playable using touch input,” Kareem Choudhry, corporate vice president, gaming cloud, said in a blog post.

The service will compete with Google’s “Project Stream”, a game streaming service that is being tested by the Alphabet Inc unit in partnership with game publisher Ubisoft.

Microsoft’s xCloud will also face competition from other popular streaming services including Nvidia’s GeForce Now and Sony’s PlayStation Now among others.

However, Sony president Kenichiro Yoshida recently said in an interview that “a next-generation hardware” is necessary. “At this point, what I can say is it’s necessary to have a next-generation hardware,” Yoshida told the Financial Times . Unfortunately, he declined to outright say that the successor to the PlayStation 4 will be called the PlayStation 5. Although details on this next-generation console have not been officially revealed, at least everyone now knows for certain that Sony is indeed working on it. The Financial Times’ sources indicate that the upcoming new console may not have a major departure from the PS4. What that exactly means remains unclear, but it’s said that the “fundamental architecture would be similar.” There are currently three versions of the PS4: the original “fat” PS4, the PS4 Slim and the PS4 Pro. There have been countless rumors and speculations regarding the PS5. In August, Ace Economic Research Institute analyst Hideki Yasuda said that the PS5 will most likely arrive sometime in 2019. In April, SemiAccurate reported that the PS5 could come out as early as 2018 and that development kits for the console have already been sent to some game developers. Meanwhile, Kotaku was able to interview dozens of game developers , including two people who are allegedly familiar with Sony’s plans. The sources all said that it’s unlikely that Sony will release the PS5 in 2018 or even in 2019. This has led to speculations that the upcoming next-generation console might arrive in 2020. The PlayStation 4 launched in 2013 and is already five years old. Sony’s consoles typically have a lifecycle of around six years, as pointed out by GameSpot . The six-year gap holds true for the original PlayStation and the PS2. However, the gap between the PS3 and PS4 was seven years. Gaming has changed significantly in the last five years and the advancement of CPU and GPU technology is getting faster than ever before. Streaming has also made a huge impact on gaming and Sony is already serving up streamable games through its PlayStation Now service. Meanwhile, Microsoft has already confirmed that the same team responsible for the Xbox One X is working on the console's successor. “The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer said, according to Eurogamer .",,Ken Manbert Salcedo,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,Sony Says It's Developing The PlayStation 4 Successor,,,

Free Backwards compat. is way ahead on Xbox. Upscaled to 4K and everything else improved. 2. 4K BR Playback is at least available on XB1S and XB1X 3. HDMI In 4. XBox Game Pass is cheaper and better than PSNow (point of contention, I know but when you can get day and date exclusives on it, it's pretty compelling). Games are the number 1 factor for most people and Sony's library far outshines Xbox's. Only Nintendo can potentially make a case otherwise. All of those things u listed will likely be in next gen consoles where things like 4k will truly be fleshed out. Hardware wise no one is denying that the one X is a good value proposition (best in fact) but there are others like me who also have gaming PCs, media centre PCs etc that can play most Microsoft games. In the end, I believe it should come down to games and whichever ones your friends and family play on. Owning more than one console also helps if you can afford time and money wise. ====================::==================== I put in my email, said I already had qualified, found the email they sent, I pressed redeem gift, put my email in on the webpage, and I go this: ""The email with your voucher code will arrive soon - keep an eye on your inbox.""

I mean, if you (as a developer) are only in it for the gratitude of the gaming public, why not just give away your game for free in the first place? If not, and want to see some sort of return on what is in all probability a multi-year venture, (and this is of course virtually everybody) then you need to think about what sort of revenue you are going to make, how you are going to make it, and over what time-frame. Lets not forget, the reason why PSNow was considered to be a bit of a flawed concept from the start was that there was a lot of doubt as to why any vendor would put their properties on it. Digital sales aren't going away. A streaming option doesn't necessarily mean an all access Netflix style service anyways. It can be utilized in various ways like giving you instant access to your digital library, or game demos, on just about any device you own, or every TV in your home instead of your main entertainment center. Also the developers and publishers of content on PSNow, gamepass, Netflix and the like are compensated. Not sure why you think they'd be giving away their games for free just because one of the ways to access the content is on a streaming service. Is it as good as a $60 guaranteed sale per user? Probably not. But the value comes in with economy of scale when you reach a mass audience with lots of subscribers. PSNows problem is the barrier to entry. You have to already have the console or the defunct proprietary pstv to get access to its content.

Solis posted... uptown710 posted... I don’t have a data cap either but your provider will throttle the s*** outta you if you start streaming games. Want proof? Tether your phone to your console and see how far you get playing a game. I’ll be surprised if it’s even playable. Definitely playable. I relied on smartphone tethering for quite some time for all of my home devices, including games and consoles, and it worked great. In fact the speeds I've gotten on my phone have been much better than the average home broadband connection in the US. Taken from howtogeek.com : “The most important thing holding back cloud gaming is internet speed. You need a fast, stable internet connection to take advantage of cloud gaming. Ideally, you’ll need a consistent 50 Mbps downstream speed, and that’s if you’re not sharing that speed with others. Having two people playing games at the same time, or having someone else streaming video in the other room, eats into that speed.” You must have the most wonderful provider in the world cause with sprint, I ideally max at about 30-31. Ideally. Ping is another big issue with this service. I avg about 35-40 on my connection and PSNow gives me lag because of my ping. I've gotten over 100mbps downstream on Verizon 4G, with pings as low as 30ms with 5ms jitter. Of course, it will be highly dependent on signal quality, tower load, etc. Edit: also, the bandwidth usage of online gaming are grossly overstated by most. Generally playing a game online won't use more than about 2mbps of total bandwidth. Even Netflix maxes out at around 30mbps of bandwidth for its highest quality stream, iirc. That’s playing a game. Streaming it is completely different. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/56knv8/how_much_bandwidth_does_playstation_now_use/#ampf=undefined These guys are pulling 100s of gigs a month. On games that are 4 years old. Right, but the article you referred to was specifically referring to playing games online, not streaming them. And 100s of gigs per month for streaming is actually pretty modest; even at 10mbps (which seems to be a fairly decent estimate for Playstation Now streaming, and is also the number that Project Xcloud is targeting), that would only require 20 hours of usage to reach 100GB of data use. The age of the games is also completely irrelevant, as the age of what's being streamed has no bearing on its data usage. They were streaming them. The guy specifically said he was streaming Killzone. I bring up the age of the game because newer games usually mean higher fidelity assets, which means more data to stream, no?",,uptown710,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Public trials for Project xCloud would begin in 2019, Microsoft said.

“We are testing Project xCloud today. The test runs on devices (mobile phones, tablets) paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller through Bluetooth, and it is also playable using touch input,” Kareem Choudhry, corporate vice president, gaming cloud, said in a blog post.

The service will compete with Google’s “Project Stream”, a game streaming service that is being tested by the Alphabet Inc unit in partnership with game publisher Ubisoft.

Microsoft’s xCloud will also face competition from other popular streaming services including Nvidia’s GeForce Now and Sony’s PlayStation Now among others.

The profit isn't in the hardware, it's in the software and services, and they've got their eyes set on the Xbox brand becoming Netflix for games. You can see this already with Minecraft on PS4 still getting full support. That's not because MS are great guys who respect all gamers who brought Minecraft in the past and want to make sure they have the best experience. It's because that sweet, sweet DLC/Server money from PS4 users is going straight to MS. Just like Microsoft willing to put Windows and MS Office on Mac, and Netflix don't care what device you watch Netflix on - Microsoft will allow anyone to play XBOX titles as long as they're getting the revenue. And since you brought it up, PSNow will NEVER do what gamepass does. Even if they start shoving exclusives on there day-1 (hahahahaha - no), there is no way they'll let you play PS5 games on your Windows PC - and an over-the-top Netflix-like service needs to be platform-agnostic. For less than the cost of a standard game, all Xbox Exclusives are automatically on my Xbox AND my PC (and soon phone) along with piles of other games. Start a game on the Xbox, when the wife wants the TV, resume on the PC, play on the phone in the office the next game. Buy a DLC once, the PC and everyone on the Xbox gets it for the one price. Sooner or later, consoles will be goners. Replaced by streaming services or built into TVs like every other live service. Microsoft are making that move now.

I'd be surprised if it releases earlier than autumn 2020 or later than autumn 2021, but I'd still like to be able to look at history and get a more concrete idea. Click to expand... Historically we've known about upcoming PlayStation systems a couple of years in advance. Only PS4 was announced and released on the same year, which is why I think 2019 could be a possibility even though 2020 is far more likely. Also with PS4 Pro still at $399.99, I don't expect PS5 to be less than $499.99 on day 1. Click to expand... I expect them to aim for $399, and my hope to that end is releasing an SKU without a disc drive, rather than compromising on the chips. Then they can put out a traditional version at $499 to the people who want to use physical media for movies/games. I think I'd go with the latter version, but I'm not even 75% sure I would. I don't buy used, I don't really sell my games unless they suck, and most of the time when I watch movies it's through my Plex server, Netflix/Hulu/Filmstruck/HBO Now, or iTunes purchases. 15 years ago I was serious about DVD collecting (I had about 350...), but in the current age that's just wasting shelf space. Plus, the PS4 Pro being $399 in 2018, roughly 2 years after it launched, doesn't necessarily mean it'll be $399 in 2019, 2020, or 2021 whenever day 1 of the PS5 is....",,theunentitled,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

The project aims to bring console-quality games to PC, consoles, and smart phone devices, and will be rolling out public trials starting in 2019.

As detailed in the announcement, players will be able to use an Xbox One controller connected to supported devices, and a small attachment connects the controller to a smart phone for portable gaming. If you don’t have an Xbox One controller, touch controls are also available.

The service uses Microsoft’s Azure as a backbone to set up new datacenters, with customized hardware that uses the parts of multiple Xbox One consoles. Azure has datacenters in 140 countries, so Microsoft feels it is already in a strong position to roll out the service wide-scale. It’s also developing ways to combat latency, with current tests running at 10 megabits per second. The ultimate goal is to make streaming available on 4G networks.

Similarly, last week Google announced its own Project Stream, using Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to issue a technical test.

Basically there is nothing stopping MS from doing that. In fact I don't need a console and would prefer to have access to those games natively on my PC. I'm a huge fan of play-anywhere from MS as i have enjoyed quite few titles here by switching from PC to the X1X and is awesome. [quote=""Thanakil, post: 2721424, member: 100781""]It depends greatly on the quality of the picture + frame rate. I'm a huge fan of open world games, so I also wanted to play Horizon: Zero Dawn, Spider-Man and get access to the rest of the Yakuza games. Since consoles already limit you in term of options, I wouldn't mind streaming those games over having my own console, but the quality isn't there yet. Google's video is much better than what PSNow currently offers, but I own AC: Odyssey and it's easy for me to compare and see the difference. It's a huge improvement compared to previous streaming services, but it's still not comparable to the real thing. So if I had to choose between paying 400$ and having the full quality, or subscribing to a service of - let's assume - 15$ a month, I'd still go for the physical console. Since I play games daily, I'm gonna get my money's worth out of it. In that regard, streaming isn't the best choice for me. Some of the games also got quite cheaper, Horizon + Expansion was only 30$ CAD. With that said, I'd definitely recommend a service like this to my sister, who enjoys gaming but doesn't get to do it often and who has no gaming equipment whatsoever. Since she doesn't play games very often, she's also less likely to see the difference in visual quality, and less likely to care about it. For me, since I'm gonna be spending a lot of money on video games no matter which option I choose, streaming would need to be really close to the real thing to be worth it. They'll probably get there eventually.[/quote] That's a valid reason and while I agree you have to remember that streaming can have other advantages too as you have total freedom where to play your games. I believe streaming won't only be limited to just streaming but they will eventually pull off something similar to what Sony do with PSNow allowing to install certain games locally in order to get the premium experience. Specially MS have all the technology and plattform with Windows, UWP and their Store to pull that off easily as X1 games are Windows 10 games this days.",,@ruantec,,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Free Backwards compat. is way ahead on Xbox. Upscaled to 4K and everything else improved. 2. 4K BR Playback is at least available on XB1S and XB1X 3. HDMI In 4. XBox Game Pass is cheaper and better than PSNow (point of contention, I know but when you can get day and date exclusives on it, it's pretty compelling). Games are the number 1 factor for most people and Sony's library far outshines Xbox's. Only Nintendo can potentially make a case otherwise. All of those things u listed will likely be in next gen consoles where things like 4k will truly be fleshed out. Hardware wise no one is denying that the one X is a good value proposition (best in fact) but there are others like me who also have gaming PCs, media centre PCs etc that can play most Microsoft games. In the end, I believe it should come down to games and whichever ones your friends and family play on. Owning more than one console also helps if you can afford time and money wise. ====================::==================== I wonder if it's because my smart tv has my netflix credentials rather than my ps4.

Sony's president has confirmed that his company is developing a new video games console. Kenichiro Yoshida told the Financial Times that ""it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware"". However, he declined to say whether the successor would be branded the PlayStation 5, the newspaper added. The announcement comes at a time when Sony and other tech firms have been experimenting with streaming games from remote servers as an alternative. The Japanese company allows titles on its cloud-based PlayStation Now service to be played via PCs, and at one time also provided access to some TVs and Blu-ray players. Microsoft has just announced Project xCloud, which will allow Xbox One games to be played on smartphones and tablets.

Considering how Sony's realized with the PS4 that going with an easy-to-develop-for PC architecture was the way to go and that it's pretty much certain that the PS5 will use a very similar or even identical architecture, I would be extremely pissed if it didn't have backwards compatibility with at least the PS4. Then again, considering how much more powerful the PS5 will be in relation to all the other Playstation systems, backwards compatibility with all of them isn't a pipe dream, either. I think it makes sense for them to release it now as well, the remaster craze seems to have died down a little and I think people wouldn't have taken kindly to yet another generation of remasters. Just give us backwards compatibility already so we can look forward to the future! Personally, what do I want from BC on the PS5 if this rumor does indeed happen to be true? Disc-based backwards compatibility . Why have backwards compatibility if all of my old physical games are no good? Backwards compatibility with ALL previous Playstations . That would be the dream. And, as stated before, should be entirely within the realm of possibility if Sony were to put their minds to it. Backwards compatibility with our previous save data. Now THIS would be the icing on the cake. If I could just pick up right where I left off... now that would be the dream. I would like it if they at least have BC with saves from the PS3 and PS4. PS1 and PS2 might be a little harder considering they use a completely different system, but if they actually manage to have a memory card port, or at the very least sell a separate accessory... I'm probably going to get that bad boy day one. Free online play for PS3 titles . If it was free on the PS3, then we should have the same experience on the PS5. So, what do you guys think? Excited for the prospect of backwards compatibility (FINALLY)? And what do you personally want from it? ====================::==================== 5 minutes ago, FilmFanatic said: Backwards compatibility doesn’t matter to me. I stopped playing PS1 and PS2 games a long time ago though I do still have the consoles and all the games I bought for them. By the time the PS5 comes out (or at least by the time I get a PS5) I want to have earned every trophy on my PS3 games that I want to so I can retire that as well. That just leaves the PS4. I won’t be getting rid of my PS4 (just like every other Playstation I’ve owned) so I’ll be happy to play my PS4 backlog on my PS4. I don't see the point, unless those old consoles are going to be collectors items at some point, just like how some elderly people hold on to antiques that are worth a fortune because they're rare and nobody makes them anymore. The recent re-releases of such games as Shemnue 1 and 2 work in my opinion because of the time that has passed. Something like Assassins Creed Rogue Remastered I think is purely done to get some more cash out of people, but mainly to attract those who never got around to the game when it first released. But knowing Ubisoft, they probably did just as shitty of a job with the PS4 version of Rogue as they did with the Ezio Auditore Collection. The one and only reason I still have a Playstation 3 is simply because there are a lot of games only for that system that will probably never see the light of day on Playstation Now. Same with the Vita, which is worse off because Sony has pretty much entirely abandoned that console. If these games were somehow put on the PS4, then yeah, I would of ditched the older consoles years ago. But even if they were on there, I probably wouldn't pay too much attention as most games I don't care about. There's a lot to be grateful for on the PS4. People can never have enough. 9 minutes ago, JEDEDIAH said: Most people will only play the mainstay games anyway. Personally I just want my favourite game, Modern Warfare 3 Which you can still do today. I have no sympathy for those who wait until the last minute to get the online done, then wish their favorite PS3 games were put on the PS5 just for the sake of having free online gameplay.",,Spaz,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,New patent heavily suggests PS5 Backwards Compatibility,,,

Public trials for Project xCloud would begin in 2019, Microsoft said. ""We are testing Project xCloud today. The test runs on devices (mobile phones, tablets) paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller through Bluetooth, and it is also playable using touch input,"" Kareem Choudhry, corporate vice president, gaming cloud, said in a blog post. The service will compete with Google's ""Project Stream"", a game streaming service that is being tested by the Alphabet Inc unit in partnership with game publisher Ubisoft.

Microsoft says its currently testing out Project xCloud and plans to open up tests to the public next year. In a blog post, the company said that game developers will be able to support the streaming service with no additional work, and that in addition to trying to solve the big ol latency problem (with Microsofts many datacenters), the team is developing a new, game-specific touch input overlay for controller-free playing. Our goal with Project xCloud is to deliver a quality experience for all gamers on all devices thats consistent with the speed and high-fidelity gamers experience and expect on their PCs and consoles, the company said.

Free Backwards compat. is way ahead on Xbox. Upscaled to 4K and everything else improved. 2. 4K BR Playback is at least available on XB1S and XB1X 3. HDMI In 4. XBox Game Pass is cheaper and better than PSNow (point of contention, I know but when you can get day and date exclusives on it, it's pretty compelling). Games are the number 1 factor for most people and Sony's library far outshines Xbox's. Only Nintendo can potentially make a case otherwise. All of those things u listed will likely be in next gen consoles where things like 4k will truly be fleshed out. Hardware wise no one is denying that the one X is a good value proposition (best in fact) but there are others like me who also have gaming PCs, media centre PCs etc that can play most Microsoft games. In the end, I believe it should come down to games and whichever ones your friends and family play on. Owning more than one console also helps if you can afford time and money wise. ====================::==================== I'm laughing at the children whining and saying they will cancel their membership because they didn't get the offer.

If Sony refuses to join this game streaming route, Sony probably will be my most respected company. I think game streaming will have it's market, but won't be able to dominate. No internet can't play, and if my internet having routing issue to the game server also can't play, i can imagine how piss off i would be.[/quote] That is only true if it happens now just as if all of sudden games were only available digitally 5 years ago. Its not something that is gonna change from one day to another and in fact it all depends if it takes off or not. Consoles as I say aren't going anywhere for the time being but as much as we are against it we all have to face reality. The reality is that we belong to a small amount of gamers this days as those ""2 billion"" casual gamers and many other ones outnumber us by far. The reality is that a lot of consoles and game sales are from casual gamers and not from the hardcore anymore. Because of that the whole industry is shifting to that direction as there is tons of cash to be made. Look at games like PUBG, Fornite, Minecraft, Call of Duty and many others. We all agree that games such as God of War, Uncharted, Horizon Zero dawn, Forza Horizon 4, Gears, Monster Hunter World and many others are far better than those games but reality says otherwise as those games outnumber by far all those titles combined. [B]""If Sony refuses to join this game streaming route, Sony probably will be my most respected company.""[/B] Sony is actually the company that tried first this generation or are you forgetting about PSNow? they are even trying to improve the service so they aren't refusing at all and if it takes off I highly doubt they are going to stay hand-crossed. That service hasn't been a success for Sony because they lack the infrastructure to pull this off properly. There are only 3 big players in this world capable of pulling that off and those are Google, Amazon and Microsoft and all the 3 are working on streaming services. As I say streaming is optional and is going to stay like that for a very long period of time i believe. Why is streaming that important? many countries around the globe have excellent internet connection and providing such a option is perfect for their needs. For instance [USER=100781]Thanakil[/USER] spent 400 bucks i guess for a PS4 Pro just to play Red Dead Redemption 2 a game that sadly isn't on PC. Imagine if he had the type of mobile connection i have with up to 160mbits and unlimited? he may not agree now but i bet he would at least consider to use such a service and play the game on PC instead by streaming it if it works well and save money. Right now it sounds bad for us and in reality it has many downsides too but we shouldn't forget that we purchase digital games nowdays and no matter what we don't have any type of ownership on those games except the permanent use as long as the service they are tied on is available. Streaming isn't any different you just have the freedom to choose anytime where to play your games.",,@ruantec,,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Win/win for both companies...for Microsoft it allows their games and service be available on a true portable console (an area they lack)...for Nintendo it offers a way to get AAA multiplats on a system that would otherwise never have them. Microsoft today announced their Project Xcloud which will start next year (and pave the way for their new Xbox streaming hardware to make it even better) The future of gaming is a world where you are empowered to play the games you want, with the people you want, whenever you want, wherever you are, and on any device of your choosing. Our vision for the evolution of gaming is similar to music and movies — entertainment should be available on demand and accessible from any screen. Today, I’m excited to share with you one of our key projects that will take us on an accelerated journey to that future world: Project xCloud. Today, the games you play are very much dictated by the device you are using. Project xCloud’s state-of-the-art global game-streaming technology will offer you the freedom to play on the device you want without being locked to a particular device, empowering YOU, the gamers, to be at the center of your gaming experience. Click to expand... To realize this vision, we know we must make it easy for developers to bring their content to Project xCloud. Developers of the more than 3,000 games available on Xbox One today, and those building the thousands that are coming in the future, will be able to deploy and dramatically scale access to their games across all devices on Project xCloud with no additional work. Click to expand... Scaling and building out Project xCloud is a multi-year journey for us. We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations. Our focus is on delivering an amazing added experience to existing Xbox players and on empowering developers to scale to hundreds of millions of new players across devices. Our goal with Project xCloud is to deliver a quality experience for all gamers on all devices that’s consistent with the speed and high-fidelity gamers experience and expect on their PCs and consoles Click to expand... Developers and researchers at Microsoft Research are creating ways to combat latency through advances in networking topology, and video encoding and decoding. Project xCloud will have the capability to make game streaming possible on 4G networks and will dynamically scale to push against the outer limits of what’s possible on 5G networks as they roll out globally. Currently, the test experience is running at 10 megabits per second. Our goal is to deliver high-quality experiences at the lowest possible bitrate that work across the widest possible networks, taking into consideration the uniqueness of every device and network Click to expand... Assassins Creed Origin and Resident Evil 7 on Switch is only the beginning. Expect most AAA 3rd party support on the Switch to be through this method for most of its lifetime ====================::==================== I do think this is the future of gaming.

What is the negative to them joining in on this??? If MS is doing all of the leg work, there is practically nothing to base your ASSUMPTIONS on that relates to this. Read the articles that have been posted, instead of arguing from ignorance. Also, why is MSs stated plans an absurdity? They said getting the games going is the easy part, it's making the service fun and playable that is their challenge. How are those assumptions? We've seen those issues in a multitude of other games when trying to release them on new platforms, how is xCloud any different? They still need acceptance from the license holders. And I'm not sure what part of statement you're arguing about, who said anything about Microsoft's plans being absurd? Microsoft aren't the ones that said EVERY game would be on the service. If you want to call someone ignorant, maybe don't ignore what they're actually saying and put words in their mouth. xboxgamer2014 posted... @Solis You can play every game that is playable on the Xbox One, the service is running on Xbox One hardware. It allows people to try out games and make them excited for new ones, gamepass already proved it works. No, you CAN'T play every game that's playable on the Xbox One on xCloud, you can only play games that have been added to the service. It might use the same hardware, but it's still a completely separate entity in terms of licensing and library. Playstation Now runs on PS3 and PS4 hardware as well for example, but obviously you can't play every single game released on those platforms on the service. SigmaLongshot posted... To those arguing about latency and large downloads, remember I did note that already as developers we're pioneering download-stream hybrid options now -TEXTURES and SOUND FILES are the main offenders when it comes to file size, so hypothetically your development team could prioritise basic geometry and basic textures for download, and large textures and SFX could be streamed. That way, the only thing affected when you're playing with a dodgy connection is that your textures might decrease in quality, but it'd be entirely playable with minimal lag. That has absolutely no relation to this scenario. This is a full streaming service, as in the actual processing is being handled by the xCloud servers, and then the result is being sent to the device that you're using. What you're talking about is basically what a multitude of other games like World of Warcraft and Guild Wars 2 do where they simply download the game as you play, it has nothing to do with a cloud-based processing service like this.",,Solis,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== CoffinDancer said: ↑ Microsoft should worry more about not ending the next console gen like the past two. They peter out from half time. Here comes Sony with all these amazing exclusives. Xbox got dick all. Microsoft launches 2 or 3 years worth of games(not even). Then just hopes the console gen ends. It is becoming a pathetic pattern. Please, Microsoft, Pimp your own ride. Click to expand... I think it will be better because MS is acquiring new studios. Honestly I think we will finally see Phil Spencer's full vision next gen because he spent most of this gen course correcting the shit that was the Xbone launch. They are making up for it a bit with the backwards compat feature and Game pass... that's all going to go forward and make the next Xbox have a shit load of features along with hopefully more ""exclusives"".

Free Backwards compat. is way ahead on Xbox. Upscaled to 4K and everything else improved. 2. 4K BR Playback is at least available on XB1S and XB1X 3. HDMI In 4. XBox Game Pass is cheaper and better than PSNow (point of contention, I know but when you can get day and date exclusives on it, it's pretty compelling). Games are the number 1 factor for most people and Sony's library far outshines Xbox's. Only Nintendo can potentially make a case otherwise. All of those things u listed will likely be in next gen consoles where things like 4k will truly be fleshed out. Hardware wise no one is denying that the one X is a good value proposition (best in fact) but there are others like me who also have gaming PCs, media centre PCs etc that can play most Microsoft games. In the end, I believe it should come down to games and whichever ones your friends and family play on.

Phil Spencer hinted that this type of service was coming soon at E3, and now we are learning more about it. The idea is quite simply, being able to play any type of game on nearly any type of device. Microsoft showed off in the video below playing Forza on an Android phone but this is on the start of what will be possible with this technology. And if Microsoft can deliver on this front, it will signifacntly change how we think about console gaming and will likely change how the market plays games as well. Imagine being able to play Xbox exclusive titles on a MacBook with nothing more than an Xbox controller and an Internet connection; for Microsoft, ProjectX Cloud will open up the gaming door to millions of more consumers.

Only microsoft does that because they use better specs. And look at how well it is going for them. The one time Sony trief to surpasd MS with hardware (ps3) the price tag skyrocketed and even if the hardware was marginally better it was a hassle for devs to squeeze the juice. Taking into account inflation and the cost of phones these days plus the success of the pro I reckon they'll release a basic for 499 and a 'plus' model for 599 to 649.

PSNOW is also getting updated. Nintendo is doing it in Japan for the Switch. Interesting times! I've tried the Nvidia one to my Shield tv and it was pretty good! Don't think this will immediatly replace consoles or PC's but if you dont want to spend cash on hardware, or want to use it on the go, its a neat service. ====================::==================== Originally Posted by MarioAna The way I see it is that there are two major hurdles that need to be sorted out before I even bother with this: Somebody needs to offer an uncapped mobile and fixed data product. One bill and you can access the internet from anywhere on any device and it must obviously be very fast and uncapped. I seriously doubt that this is going to be okay for multiplayer online games where milliseconds count. Lag now without needing to stream is rubbish for us and I'm pretty sure we still won't get local servers for these services either. Overall it's not my preference but if that's where gaming goes then I'll likely go with it. Azure is coming to za is it not? The Microsoft one is not meant to replace consoles, but to be an add on for when you are not at your TV or to get non traditional gamers into the ecosystem. Google one will be same idea. Nvidia is still tied to more hardcore hardware.",,Uberutang,South Africa,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Cloud to device game streaming,,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== CoffinDancer said: ↑ Microsoft should worry more about not ending the next console gen like the past two. They peter out from half time. Here comes Sony with all these amazing exclusives. Xbox got dick all. Microsoft launches 2 or 3 years worth of games(not even). Then just hopes the console gen ends. It is becoming a pathetic pattern. Please, Microsoft, Pimp your own ride. Click to expand... Then destroy every studio they get their hands on internally. All these studios they're buying up will be buried by the end of next gen because Xbots don't buy those type of games. Fact. R.I.P. Obsidian.

Being run in completely different ways. That's like comparing Xbox's service to Playstation Now. They're incomparable because they're just not even competing in the same market. Playstation Now isn't for brand new triple A titles. It's not marketed that way. They're focusing on a way to play older games from past generations as well as indie games for the newer generation. They aren't focusing on getting brand new games. You're not going to see games like Spiderman or the new God of War or Horizon Zero Dawn on this service in it's current format. Maybe one day they'll break the mold and go for that type of service. I think it becomes more likely as more people join the service.

So, for the foreseeable future that will be why you will want a PS5 because there will be no other way to play the brand new games. And as for BC, the reason to push for it is because PSNow will be offering the games in two ways: By streaming and by download. To do the download option the PS5 will need to emulate the systems before it. Not to mention that Sony will want to offer the catalog on a per game basis through PSN.

Super Mario Brothers is one of the greatest games ever, and so is the Legend of Zelda. Those games are available to you, forever (as long as you're subscribed, tee hee!) for absolutely free (with a yearly fee, but it's so trivial it shouldn't be used against it) Frankly as janky as the service can be, ""PlayStation Now"" is simply a superior service, especially now that it supports game downloading. 20 bucks for 20 NES games VS 100 bucks for 700+ PlayStation 2, 3, and 4 games. Yyyeah... and I'd say the same about X-Box GamePass, though I'm less familiar with its library. Excitebike? Ice Climber? Double Dragon? Ice Hockey? Donkey Kong? Tennis? NES Open Tournament? (sports classic) The last NES games that ever needed to see the light of day again were the sports titles. Oh, and is that not good enough? Need more punishment, Mr. Entitled? NINJA GAIDEN! THIS DECEMBER! If that's not good enough, Mighty Bomb Jack and Solomons Key will keep ya busy! (Wario's Woods isn't one to sleep on, either, and neither is classic Twinbee) I have Ninja Gaiden on my NES Classic. So basically, you get 20 full length games with brand new online play (which technically qualifies them as new games) and restore points for the first time ever on an official Nintendo console, with voice chat, online play and a mobile phone app all included in 20 bones a year? Compared to what, PS4 and it's flunky-bum forced online games like Steep, The Crew and Overwatch. I already have most of these games with restore points on an official Nintendo consoles. The only addition is multiplayer, and most of the games worth playing don't have simultaneous multiplayer anyway. Also calling them ""full length"" games is just plain wrong. Full length in the 80's is not the same as full-length today. 20 full length technically new games that will be ever expanding with a custom controller for a fair price > 2 mediocre games a month that you can only nab for 30 days You are trying so hard, and getting so far... yet in the end it doesn't even matter.

Very pro-consumer move from Sony. Still exclusives. Otherwise if these are not exclusives then there has never been a thing as a exclusive video game since streaming a game through another system has always been possible one way or another. Technically, until Sony ends the streams for these games for other platforms, they're currently multiplat. But at least it's only select games right now. I don't agree, if we allow this to take away exclusivity then the term exclusive loses its sense completely. You would need a bunch of mental gymnastics to say why these are not exclusives but emulated games are still or a game that can be streamed by other means is. It opens up a bunch of exceptions over more exceptions. Better just leave the term exclusive as it was originally intended: a game that can run natively on a particular systems architecture. But this is an official channel from Sony to allow people to play the games. If it can be played on more than one platform = multiplat. Being run from a hard drive or not doesn't change that. I wouldn't lose sleep over it though. If Sony put all of their current first party games on the service, then that would be a BIG uh oh. It's still more optimal to play the games on native hardware anyway, but PSNow is okay enough for plebs, I haven't really had problems with it when I used it. Yeah but I still don't see why officiality matters or not here, you still can play the games without owning the machine if you want and the end result is the same: you're playing the game. But yeah whatever, if you want to consider them not exclusive go ahead, I just don't feel I can do it without remaining consistent myself.",,Zappat,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== keytarhero said: ↑ Hope they make it a powerhouse and leave out backward compatibility. BC weakens consoles. Needs to require 4K for all games. Hopefully my parents will buy me that 65"" OLED by then. Click to expand... lol wut? It would be on the same architecture so they wouldn't have to add any chips with additional costs like it would take to make PS3 games BC on a PS4. Does a PC ever weaken?

The tech wasnt ready. Google and Microsoft, two of the biggest companies have barely started doing the very thing Sony started on about 5 years ago. Now youre just trying to avoid your own claim. AAA exclusives exist on the service and many are PS3 games. There are also Indie console/PS4 exclusives like Resogun and Everybody's Gone to Rapture. Those new games wont be put on PSNow when those titles already sell really well on their own. If Microsoft does that then thats great for them. Sony has been adding more and more PS4 titles lately but not major exclusive games. Nah. You cant say PSNow is a response to BC when BC for Xbox wasnt even released until late 2015. Thats literally impossible especially when Gaikai was bought before the PS4 and Xbox One were released. PSNow was available on many devices already but it still wasnt great. The tech was too young and has hardly improved since. Microsoft is basically doing the same thing Sony did by using Xbox One's to power the streaming service similarly to using PS3's to power PSNow. Microsoft is now trying to fight the main issue which is latency and the quality of the stream. Nvidia is doing the same also by bruteforcing it while also requiring high speeds of up to 50mbs plus. Sony's current solution is through downloads that recently became a thing. As of right now, no one is really aware of Sony's plans other than some rumor from Jez stating they are improving their cloud infrastructure. And if they can do that, there is no reason for them to not add the devices previously supported.",,XTheLegendHasBegunX,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Yeah. The only thing I see as different is that they're saying that it will work with all Xbox One games. That could be a game changer if it means they will all be available to stream. They haven't said anything about it working with all Xbox One games. In fact it was made clear that getting games onto the platform would require additional work, which basically excludes a number of games where the developer/publisher has gone bankrupt, the license holder has no interest in putting the games on the service, or where additional licensing restrictions prevent the re-issuing of the game. WOW, have you not read the most recent articles? Literally everything you just said is FALSE. Phil said it won't take any extra effort from developers. You are also conflating Game Pass with xCloud, 2 different things. xCloud will allow you to play ANY of the XBOX library games anywhere, on almost every device. xCloud will not be a paid streaming service, it will be no different than purchasing games now, except you will now have the ability to stream that game anywhere you are. Go read some articles instead of pretending you know what you're talking about. I already stated that my phrasing of calling it work was incorrect as I was referring to the licensing from the rights holder. And no, you're wrong thinking that you'll be able to play any of the Xbox game library, that's why it specifically states in the article ""game studios only needed to agree to add their game to the library"", which again means it's reliant on the authorization from whatever companies own the rights to the game. SigmaLongshot posted... Precisely - the only difference with THIS technology is, potentially, you can buy a digital version of Halo, then simply access it on ANY device you have your Xbox application on. And, simply conjecture, but that may mean depending on the device you access your games from, you get better performance (a phone might offer a bit less oomph than a high-end PC, for example). The whole point is ELIMINATION OF A TETHER. With the Wii U, it was being unable to take your tablet too far from the main unit. With PSVITA play of PS4 games, you were required to have a PS4 on nearby. With this, we could potentially see the elimination of any ""hub"" hardware altogether - it'd be completely remote. And, instead of the device being a bespoke, made-for-purpose proprietary device (ie, ""you can play your Xbox games on the Xbox Handheld which has the Xbox official connectors"") you can literally use ANY device that can accept the application. Groundbreaking stuff. That's actually the same situation as Playstation Now: any device that has the application could play the service's full library of games. You could use it on PS3, Vita, PC, PS4, even Smart TVs, and access not only the games themselves but also your saves with any suitable internet connection (they have recently dropped support for the PS3, Vita, and Smart TV app, however). OnLive also worked the same way, being usable across their set top box, PCs, smartphones, and tablets. As an aside, the Vita can still connect to a PS4 online through Remote Play, close proximity is not required. In fact, this concept isn't even new to this generation: the PSP could actually remote play online to the PS3 as well, although playing games through remote play required the feature to be built into them (which few did). Not the concept but implementation, you ever seen a Azure like platform being used for gaming? PSNow doesn't even come close",,xboxgamer2014,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I'm confused why anyone would buy a new console if this were the case, I mean its not like new platforms start with a glut of software, the first 12 months is usually pretty slow for product. Unfortunately however it tends to be a critical time for establishing the platform, so anything that impedes it out of the gate is likely a bad business move long term. I'd also add as an adjunct to what I've been saying about the economics of streaming for content creators, don't you think this all sounds really similar to the fervor surrounding the rise of smartphone/tablet games and how as the (graphics) technology improved it'd spell doom for consoles as everyone would jump on that bandwagon due to the vastly larger addressable market? What actually happened is that the economics shaped the type of product; rather than traditional games, everything went f2p as it became apparent that the market was way risky for high-price, single-purchase titles irrespective of quality. The same thing applies for streaming, its a distribution mechanism that only really suits GAAS type offerings, and just like with phones that's going to shape the product landscape and the type of user it attracts.

Microsoft has announced its own online game streaming service: Project xCloud. The gaming world is changing, and we’ve seen the likes of Blade’s Shadow, Nvidia’s GeForce Now, Playstation Now, and even Google Chrome’s own browser-based streaming solution gain traction over the last year. And now Microsoft, the PC and console giant, will join the list of hopeful tech companies fighting for streaming supremacy. While technically an Xbox streaming service, Microsoft has been set on opening up its gaming library to more devices than just its own proprietary hardware as of late – with Windows PCs some of the first to benefit. This move looks to be similarly targeting the platform boundaries we’ve been locked behind for so long, instead opening up the Xbox library to more devices than the company’s dedicated hardware can reach alone. Project xCloud will use custom server rack hardware to power the experience – all based on existing Xbox One console components. That means custom AMD GPUs and accompanying memory will be the workhorse keeping Microsoft’s cloud gaming servers ticking over. This looks to be a big win for AMD – most cloud servers we’ve run into so far have employed Nvidia graphics cards for the grunt work rather than team red’s tech. AMD works closely with both Microsoft and Sony on their respective Xbox One and Playstation consoles. AMD’s Navi architecture, arriving sometime in 2019, was even rumoured to be making its way into a future Playstation 5 console. But it’s the software developments that might interest us PC folk most of all. Latency poses a huge challenge for anyone developing a streaming service, or indeed playing one, but Microsoft reckons it has the best expertise and access to deliver a stronger streaming service than ever with Project xCloud.",,caromero1965,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,MS announced AMD based cloud game streaming,,,

Dubbed Project xCloud, it’s designed to work across consoles, PCs, and even mobile devices. “Scaling and building out Project xCloud is a multi-year journey for us,” explains Microsoft’s cloud gaming chief Kareem Choudhry. “We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations.” Microsoft has built custom hardware for its datacenters, as The Verge previously exclusively reported, so that existing and future Xbox games will be compatible with the services. Games will be streamed to devices, and Microsoft has been testing the xCloud service with Xbox wireless controllers connected to consoles, mobile devices, and PCs. Microsoft says its research teams are “creating ways to combat latency” via advanced network techniques combined with video encoding and decoding. This should make game streaming viable on 4G networks, too. Public trials of the service will begin next year, and Microsoft’s Xbox game streaming service will face competition from a variety of existing services. The most popular include GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Microsoft’s xCloud unveiling comes just days after Google announced its own Project Stream service that will let testers play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop. Microsoft isn’t revealing exactly what it’s doing differently to the competition, but we’ll find out more details when public testing starts in 2019.

It can’t be that there is a significant difference between a streaming service that only offers Sony games and only streams to 2 home devices and a streaming service that offers 1st and 3rd party games and streams to every device (including mobile). It must be that everyone in the industry observing and reporting on these developments is biased against Sony. Yes, Yes, We know, The Truth is Out There. Carry on Mulder. No its just fundamentally ill-considered. (1) The whole point of streaming is platform agnosticism, so dismissing an extant service of the exact same type seems dubious to me. (2) The money in this is in the SERVICE, not the deployment point(s) of the client. (3) Following on from 3 why disregard the publisher/service provider currently serving the largest range of streamed titles from various providers and also holds platform leadership in the console space? Think about it: From where is the content coming and where the existing revenue stream primarily comes from? The best service in the world is nothing without content to drive uptake. Games are not going to magically appear *just* to serve a streaming server, and its questionable that there's enough money purely from licensing/viewing royalties to subsidize production cost, games will often need to incorporate service type transactions of their own in order to survive in that environment. So tell me this, how appealing is a streaming service loaded with games with F2P-style economics? Its never going to be like Netflix because of the economics of production, how do you cover years worth of upfront spend developing AAA games for a tiny share of a low-cost subscription model without going bust before you've recouped a fraction of the investment? Then, of course we come to additional issues like interface design. Sure its great you can now see console-quality graphics on your phone, but now you either need to gimp yourself playing with the touch-screen or fiddle about with a controller that's exponentially larger in size than the phone or its screen! Why not just buy a Switch and get stuff that's actually built for purpose? Why not stick with a game that designed for mobile/tablet usage rather than frankenstein shit onto everything in the name of ""accessibility""? If you're on PC, where's the imperative to abandon Steam, GoG, or any other retailer with its own existing massive market-share and userbase that frequently sells games dirt cheap in sales? Games that are just as likely to get lost in the churn of an a-la carte service as they are on online storefronts? And lets not forget, regardless of how good the lag-reduction is, its always going to be there and its a major no-no for anything competitive where ping-times are crucial. And last, but far from least, lets talk about infrastructure and billing. No matter how good the back-end is, the end user still needs to worry about QOS in their location and what restrictions on bandwidth/data-caps are in place. Lets not forget too how exceptionally vulnerable these services are going to be to things like DDOS attacks, you think XBL and PSN outages are bad what happens when there is no offline option to fall back on... Streaming is going to be next gen's VR. Great idea in theory but in the short to mid-term there are many, many obstacles to cross and its going to be years before it really gains traction. One last thing: I bring up PSNow not out of favoritism for Sony or particular affection for the service. The reverse is actually true: Sony has been piloting this approach on their highly successful console lines now for over 4 years, and to what end? When they can't get much traction with it, despite having access to a very substantial user-base and access to as good a selection of content as anyone in the industry, why should a slightly better iteration of the same suddenly blow our collective minds?

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== I'll definitely buy a PS5 but I'm not sure when. For me to buy one at launch it has to have the following: PS4 backwards compatibility PSVR backwards compatibility It's own games not on PS4 $400-ish price point There's no reason for me to be excited about next gen just yet and still tons of great looking PS4 games coming.",,Telekill,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

The one time Sony trief to surpasd MS with hardware (ps3) the price tag skyrocketed and even if the hardware was marginally better it was a hassle for devs to squeeze the juice. Taking into account inflation and the cost of phones these days plus the success of the pro I reckon they'll release a basic for 499 and a 'plus' model for 599 to 649. Just a hunch.

My personal experience is that I didn't notice any unacceptable lag from the time I would send a gamepad command to it happening on the screen, but the image I was getting from the stream wasn't super great quality and I had many moments of artifacting and choppiness. ​ I'm using an xbox one controller with the adapter (not Bluetooth) and am on a 400mpbs down / 50 up connection. My latency however was at the very upper end of what it can be before they'll even let you play the game (anything over 40ms and it will not let you stream the game, mine was reporting as exactly 40ms). ​ I live in Oklahoma and I don't think Google has any servers very close to me (and looking at the Azure datacenter map, neither does Microsoft) so I don't think streaming is going to be the best experience that can be had in my area until they do. I would much rather play the game on my X than stream it given the experience I've had so far; however, it would be kind of cool for use on a phone/tablet and I think the performance I'm getting even here in OK would be acceptable for that (Google does not currently support playing on anything but a PC/Mac/Linux so I can't test it). I'm looking forward to playing with xCloud to see how it differs, I haven't signed up for the trial of PSNow yet on my PS4 but I will probably do that just to see how well the 3 services compare when I can. ​ My plan is to play through the main story on Project Cloud (used the free 1000 to buy the XP boost), then I'll buy the Gold edition down line on One X to replay that, do the sidequests, and DLC.

People have to get their excuses out of their heads and stop fighting it. If you don't like streaming there will still be an option for you. Its just like movies. You can still buy your Blu Ray and own the physical disc, but most people will stream a movie/TV show now a days. Anyone saying ISP or data caps etc, your no different then people 10/15 years ago when Netflix was just starting. LOL you are the Blockbuster CEO's who passed on buying Netflix because they thought no one would ever have the ability to stream a DVD quality movie ROFL. The more players involved the better, that means more competition. Sony sat on their ass with PSNow essentially destroying the service, but now with MS getting involved maybe they actually do something with it. Notice how now they have downloading and are adding some more PS4 games. Hopefully the tech should be pushed forward as well. If Apple can get involved that would really heat the space up. And this could also be huge for VR gaming.

You’re isolating people with data caps and less than stellar internet service. Things like thi would work for smaller games. I don’t think anything from 6th gen up would work on anything but the fastest connections. It's an option... not a requirement. A traditional system will be released along side any ""Streaming Only"" consoles that MS releases. SpikeTheSpaceCo WINS! FATALITY! Look at it this way, I can be playing a game on my NextBox, have to go to work, save my game and have it upload to The Cloud then whip out my phone on the bus and continue from exactly where I was using Streaming, save my progress and then get right back to my new save point and progress when I get home to my Console. And you win at not looking at the big picture. What game are you gonna play on your current gen system and then play on your phone? Your phone service provider would rape you over those data charges. Not to mention most console games control like ass on a smartphone. Playing FF6 on my iPhone is a lesson in patience. @SpikeTheSpaceCo this is the direction hardware companies are heading. They hate having to invest in hardware as that usually nets them little to no money for a few years. And I say you’re isolating people because the streaming service will probably offer titles that you can’t get on a current physical based console (I remember some games on PSNow not being available on the PSN). So now you're making stuff up to strengthen your argument lol. Take your Doom and Gloom 'hear-say' and go away. Exactly what am I making up? I swear a lot of you live on fantasy island. If this tech was viable, Microsoft would’ve done it long ago. Sony has it to a degree and it’s expensive, and it sucks in comparison to actually having the hard data on your console. LMFAO!!!

It's been coming since before we all laughed at OnLive and ignored PlayStation Now, and those too-little-too-soon gambits did nothing to impede its inevitable arrival. It is the future, in the sense that a credible and widely-used iteration of game streaming technology is around the corner and is something everyone reading this will probably end up using. Whether this future will prove mutually exclusive with other futures - those of games consoles and of digital platforms like Steam - is much more debatable. But it's coming regardless. The games industry was unequivocal on that fact at E3 this year. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot mentioned it to anyone who would listen, while EA promised its own service tied into EA Access. More consequentially (with the greatest respect to EA), Phil Spencer said Microsoft was planning an Xbox-branded game streaming service. Earlier this week, we heard the first details about what Microsoft is calling Project xCloud, in apparent response to last week's announcement of a long-rumoured game streaming offering from Google. Google's Project Stream is already in testing in the US; xCloud hardware is being installed in data centres, but public testing won't begin until next year. Game streaming is treated as an inevitability because this is the way all media has been going; just look at the rise to ubiquity of the music and video streaming services Spotify and Netflix. But game streaming is a far greater technical challenge, due to the extremely fast-moving and detailed live video and, of course, to its interactive nature, requiring an extremely low-latency two-way dialogue between the client and the server. This is where OnLive fell down and it's part of the reason PlayStation Now still fails to impress (it's also true that Sony has, frankly, never put together a very tempting or marketable offering for it). Low video quality is unappealing, but sluggish controls can break the experience completely.

Microsoft anuncia serviço de streaming de jogos xCloud (Vídeo)



A Microsoft anunciou hoje o Project xCloud, um serviço de streaming de jogos da Xbox que foi desenhado para ser compatível com os computadores, consolas e dispositivos móveis.

Segundo o artigo do The Verge, o teste do Project xCloud, que será apoiado pelos data centers da empresa de Redmond, vai ter início em 2019 e os participantes vão poder usar os comandos da Xbox One.

A Microsoft revelou, ainda, que as equipas responsáveis pelo desenvolvimento do novo serviço de streaming de jogos estão a criar novas soluções para combater a latência que envolvem técnicas avançadas de rede com a codificação e descodificação de vídeo.

Os actuais serviços de streaming de jogos incluem o GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow e o Liquid Sky.

Free Backwards compat. is way ahead on Xbox. Upscaled to 4K and everything else improved. 2. 4K BR Playback is at least available on XB1S and XB1X 3. HDMI In 4. XBox Game Pass is cheaper and better than PSNow (point of contention, I know but when you can get day and date exclusives on it, it's pretty compelling). Games are the number 1 factor for most people and Sony's library far outshines Xbox's. Only Nintendo can potentially make a case otherwise. All of those things u listed will likely be in next gen consoles where things like 4k will truly be fleshed out. Hardware wise no one is denying that the one X is a good value proposition (best in fact) but there are others like me who also have gaming PCs, media centre PCs etc that can play most Microsoft games. In the end, I believe it should come down to games and whichever ones your friends and family play on.

178855660522,10/8/2018,http://reuters-com-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/178855660522,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is testing a new game streaming service called Project xCloud that is designed to work across PCs, consoles and mobile devices, the company said on Monday.

Public trials for Project xCloud would begin in 2019, Microsoft said.

“We are testing Project xCloud today. The test runs on devices (mobile phones, tablets) paired with an Xbox Wireless Controller through Bluetooth, and it is also playable using touch input,” Kareem Choudhry, corporate vice president, gaming cloud, said in a blog post.

The service will compete with Google’s “Project Stream”, a game streaming service that is being tested by the Alphabet Inc unit in partnership with game publisher Ubisoft.

Microsoft’s xCloud will also face competition from other popular streaming services including Nvidia’s GeForce Now and Sony’s PlayStation Now among others.

But what is the PS5? According to FT sources, “the first indications were that it did not represent a significant deviation from PS4 and that the basic architecture would be similar”.

Whatever it is, Sony may not be in a hurry to push the Next-Gen start button, which still makes billions for the company with the phenomenally successful PS4.

However, it is clear that things are getting worse in the console area of the next generation. At E3, Microsoft announced that it had begun work on the “upcoming Xbox consoles.”

“The same team that delivers unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deeply involved in the development of upcoming Xbox consoles, where we will once again fulfill our ambition to set the benchmark for console games,” said the Xbox boss. Phil Spencer.

Streaming will undoubtedly be a key offer for next generation consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced its own video game transmission offer called Project xCloud. Along the way, Microsoft plans a few next generation consoles, a more traditional console and a console focused on the transmission.",,sethgame27,Philippines,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4,Post,,

Microsoft’s Project xCloud will stream Xbox games to phones, tablets and more - CNETHalo, Forza and more Xbox games are coming to phones and tablets through the service.

Summary

 * The games work both with an Xbox wireless controller paired over Bluetooth and using a touchscreen overlay when there’s no controller present 
 * “Project xCloud’s state-of-the-art global game-streaming technology will offer you the freedom to play on the device you want without being locked to a particular device 
 * Game-streaming services themselves aren’t new: Sony has its PlayStation Now service; Ubisoft is partnering with Google to have Assassin’s Creed Odyssey stream in the Chrome browser; and Capcom’s Resident Evil 7 is available on Nintendo Switch in Japan via streaming

Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL: Rumored specs, features, leaks, price, October 9 announce date - CNETWe think we know pretty much exactly what we’ll see from Google this Tuesday.

Summary

 * And we’d already seen a lot before – including a full-fledged multimedia showcase posted by Russian bloggers earlier this year and a prototype Pixel 3 XL found in the backseat of a Lyft a few weeks back 
 *  has compelling new features – such as multiplayer AR and enhancements to its already-superior voice assistant – that will likely be integrated in the Pixel 3 
 * ) And the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL may be more different from one another than in previous years – chiefly due to the iPhone-like notched design that Google is rumored to have given the larger model

Unicorn startups are making a comeback - CNETAfter a slump, the third quarter booms with companies with $1 billion valuations.

Summary

 * One reason for the growth might be larger late-stage rounds that push companies over the top in valuation 
 * The number of deals that occurred in the third quarter declined to 1 
 * Most of the money that was doled out this quarter went to more mature companies

Is Xbox deleting themselves from the console families? Ridiculous. Are users here deliberately trying to get offended by everything these days? Both MS and Sony have confirmed they are working on the next gen consoles. The cloud thing is already up and running, and is not even remotely a replacement for the new consoles. Knowing MS they would try something against the wishes of Xbox fans. Total digital with a Netflix type gaming service. No more hard copies. Sony is a little more traditional I think. um, no. Sony had psnow first and talked about streaming before ms Sony had the all digital PSP I love how people conveniently forget all the s*** that Sony has pulled but wont let MS forget a single thing. It's weird. I wish I hated Sony so I could understand the ridiculous thoughts that lead them to saying dumb crap, but unfortunately I'm an Xbox fan who will happily buy a PS4. Like, you know these fools had a major identity crisis when the X came out. ""It's the best console, BUT I MUST KEEP LICKING SONY'S SACK AS THE GODS DEMAND!"" It's like the cross-play situation. They were literally praising anti-consumerism so their beloved Sony didn't get bad press, which they got anyway because of said anti-consumerism. This all happen while they whine about a single event by Microsoft and claim it as ""anti-consumer."" (Not saying it wasn't!) Wtf? The only people who had an 'identity crisis', as you so eloquently put it, were in the MS camp. Sony fans never cared, and no intelligent consumer was going to go buy another $500 box to play their current library that wasn't even guaranteed to make use of the new box. The MS camp though has been reassuring themselves quite feverishly since, buyers remorse running thick like molasses at this point. Secondly, your lack of knowledge is showing here. Sony has had cross play for years now and even tried to reach out to MS, though was denied. This is a fact you cannot ignore. Just because it wasn't cross play on ONE game doesn't mean they didn't have it. Now all of a sudden MS makes a big deal out of it and there's the bad press. Shows how mature Sony's PR team is and how immature MS' is. Finally, TC isn't wrong. MS does want to get out of the console family business. They've said it themselves and even based the Xbox 1 (remember, all in one) on that ideology. If anyone moves away from physical media and traditional consoles first it will be them to try and 'lead the future'. They are primed for it since they keep failing in a traditional format.",,RyWx,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

178854223906,10/8/2018,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/178854223906,"Microsoft has announced its own approach to streaming video games, called Project xCloud. The project aims to bring console-quality games to PC, consoles, and smart phone devices, and will be rolling out public trials starting in 2019.

As detailed in the announcement, players will be able to use an Xbox One controller connected to supported devices, and a small attachment connects the controller to a smart phone for portable gaming. If you don’t have an Xbox One controller, touch controls are also available.

The service uses Microsoft’s Azure as a backbone to set up new datacenters, with customized hardware that uses the parts of multiple Xbox One consoles. Azure has datacenters in 140 countries, so Microsoft feels it is already in a strong position to roll out the service wide-scale. It’s also developing ways to combat latency, with current tests running at 10 megabits per second. The ultimate goal is to make streaming available on 4G networks.

Similarly, last week Google announced its own Project Stream, using Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to issue a technical test. PlayStation Now, meanwhile, has offered streaming games for quite a while, but recently began offering the option of downloading instead.

One thing I really like is the customisable difficulty. Rather than just flat out easy, medium or hard, you can fine tune specific mechanics like enemy health, visibility, realistic weapon attachments, bullet drop etc. Even has MP too, surprised to see quite a large amount of lobbies running for different modes given that the game came out a while back I think.

I don’t have a data cap either but your provider will throttle the s*** outta you if you start streaming games. Want proof? Tether your phone to your console and see how far you get playing a game. I’ll be surprised if it’s even playable. Definitely playable. I relied on smartphone tethering for quite some time for all of my home devices, including games and consoles, and it worked great. In fact the speeds I've gotten on my phone have been much better than the average home broadband connection in the US. Taken from howtogeek.com : “The most important thing holding back cloud gaming is internet speed. You need a fast, stable internet connection to take advantage of cloud gaming. Ideally, you’ll need a consistent 50 Mbps downstream speed, and that’s if you’re not sharing that speed with others. Having two people playing games at the same time, or having someone else streaming video in the other room, eats into that speed.” You must have the most wonderful provider in the world cause with sprint, I ideally max at about 30-31. Ideally. Ping is another big issue with this service.

As summary of the patent is as follows: >Each asset such as a texture called for by legacy software such as a legacy computer game software has a unique identifier associated with it. The unique identifier can be rendered by imposing a hash on the asset, and then the asset stored with its identifier in a data structure. An artist remasters the textures for presentation on a higher resolution display than envisioned in the original software, and stores them back in the data structure with their identifiers. The original software is then played on the higher resolution display, with asset (such as texture) calls being intercepted, identified, and the data structure entered to retrieve the remastered asset having a matching identifier. The remastered asset is then inserted on the fly into the game presentation. https://archive.fo/4IE8H Even if Sony add backwards compatibility, I somehow doubt it won't end up in the same disaster that it was with the PS3. ====================::==================== >>15556092 >Remastering by emulation Isn't that how they sold PSNow?

It just scares me to see more and more Cloud option, because it seems to be the ""logicial"" future for many companies, Ubisoft for example said that for them Cloud is the future and they would love to have only cloud and no more static hardware in the future, and if they feel like that, I'm pretty sure others do. If it was guaranteed to remain a non mandatory option, then fine, but I'm just scared it becomes the norm.

178882303060,10/9/2018,http://the-telegraph-fin-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/178882303060,"Japanese technology giant Sony has spoken for the first time about its plans for the next-generation successor of the successful Playstation 4 video game console.

“At this point, what I can say is it’s necessary to have a next-generation hardware,” said Sony President Kenichiro Yoshida in an interview with the Financial Times, but stopped short of naming any new console Playstation 5.

The commitment to a next-generation console comes as discussion begins to heat up over the next round of the so-called ‘console wars’ and the future of dedicated gaming hardware.

Microsoft, Sony’s main rival in the home gaming market, confirmed at the E3 2018 conference in June that its engineers were working on a next-generation successor to the Xbox One X console. Meanwhile, third-party publishers such as Bethesda announced that they were working on blockbuster games destined for the next-generation, rather than the current Playstation 4 and Xbox One consoles.
The Playstation 4 has been a huge success for Sony, selling over 82 million units worldwide 
However, with the emergence of cloud-streaming game services, such as Microsoft’s recently announced Project xCloud, there is likely to be a significant shift in the gaming market when the next generation of consoles emerge.

With both Sony and Microsoft committing to high-end machines, which will certainly feature 4K output, they will likely be positioned as the best way to experience high-end video games. While streaming services will offer similar games played in a scaled-back capacity.

Sony already has its Playstation Now subscription-based streaming service, which allows gamers to stream select Playstation games on PC or PS4, but with Microsoft bringing its own streaming service to mobile devices Sony will be looking to expand its offering.

Industry rumours suggest that both the Playstation 5 and the next Xbox will not feature a significant shift in architecture, but that Sony and Microsoft will offer multiple hardware solutions for different types of players. A recent patent suggested that Sony could be looking at backwards compatibility for PS5, a feature that has served the Xbox One well in recent months.
Sony has enjoyed a strong line-up of exclusives for the PS4, including the recently released Marvel’s Spider-Man 
Until now, Sony has not been as forthcoming with its next-generation or streaming plans as Microsoft. The Playstation 4 has been incredibly successful for the company, easily beating its main rival Xbox One in sales terms. 

Sony recently revealing that it had sold over 82 million consoles since its release in 2013, including the re-modelled PS4 Slim and premium PS4 Pro. While Microsoft have stopped releasing official sales data for the Xbox One, it is believed that the total number of Xbox Ones sold is less than half of Sony’s PS4 total.

It is likely that Sony want to keep the current generation rolling as long as it can to capitalise on its sales lead and significantly stronger line-up of exclusive games. Sony still has a strong slate of PS4 games for 2019, including Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding and The Last of Us Part Two.

With the face of the console industry likely to change in the next-generation, it is no surprise that Microsoft are keener to pull the trigger. While no concrete release dates have been suggested for the Playstation 5 or the next Xbox, industry analysts believe the next-generation will likely start in 2020.",,the-telegraph-fin-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Playstation 5: Next-generation  hardware is 'necessary' says Sony,Post,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== MatthewGavin10 said: ↑ gencid said: ↑ The most interesting thing from PS5 for me would be the form that the Dual Shock 5 will take. I also hope it releases next year instead of 2020, so that I can stop adding games to my PS4 backlog. Click to expand...

Phil Spencer hinted that this type of service was coming soon at E3, and now we are learning more about it. The idea is quite simply, being able to play any type of game on nearly any type of device. Microsoft showed off in the video below playing Forza on an Android phone but this is on the start of what will be possible with this technology. And if Microsoft can deliver on this front, it will signifacntly change how we think about console gaming and will likely change how the market plays games as well. Imagine being able to play Xbox exclusive titles on a MacBook with nothing more than an Xbox controller and an Internet connection; for Microsoft, ProjectX Cloud will open up the gaming door to millions of more consumers. Didn't see a thread on this but they've put a public name on their game streaming stuff now.

If it is better than something like Playstation Now was, that would be alright. I tried that out twice, and was never that impressed. My internet is respectable, so I doubt that was the issue. i'll be curious to see where this goes. Click to expand... The beta gamers on Nvidia streaming and Google’s project Streaming already have glowing reviews on it..and I can only imagine Microsoft’s version will be even better since they have put so much development time and money into this (It’s all better than psnow...while Sony was forward thinking in offering such a service first, they suffer from not investing in the tech at all, and being narrow in the service they offer. I like to think of it as like James Cameron being able to show people how awesome 3D movies can be...but unfortunately the glut of mediocre 3D conversion movies since have made people think 3D sucks/unnecessary. PsNow is the mediocre version of this tech, that is unfortunately causing corner gamers to shrug their shoulders at the idea) The latency and input lag is already down to the point where it doesn’t really matter. Microsoft will be offering a ~$100 box with their next gen stuff that has hardware in it to do half the work and make latency/input lag close to zero for those who really are sensitive to it. But honestly, gamers who game on consoles and hdtv’s have already conditioned themselves to put up with input lag (compared to pc/monitor gaming). It’s all relative. The majority of mainstream gamers will see streaming as the better option. Any drawbacks that core/hardcore see it streaming...really won’t matter. Streaming games at top of the line hardware quality on cheap old hardware is better than spending $400-$500 for less input lag...hardware that will eventually get old. With streaming, the games upgrade on the servers and you don’t have to upgrade hardware at home (or on the go) I mean, you tell the casual mainstream gamer all they have to do is pay $100 for the Xbox streaming box in order to play cyberpunk2077 at full ultra quality? As well as all other games? And never have to worry about upgrading? It will be the best option for most Click to expand... Link? Proof? Because I call bullshit on this generalization. I play on both and I'm sensitive to input lag. It's a pretty big sweeping generalization you made there without any facts to back it up. Click to expand... Wait...you are asking for proof that the majority of people in the world will overlook small amounts of input lag in their videogaming in order to play all games at modern visual quality on ubiquitous/cheap hardware? Is that what you are asking a source on? lol I mean, you just have to look at how casual/mainstream consumers consume to know this is true lol They will always choose convenience/cheaper for their media consumption even if it means not getting absolutely fidelity. This has always happened, this will always happen. As far as specifically to mainstream/casual gamers...we’ve seen them perfectly fine putting up with latency in online gaming, accepting sub native resolutions, perfectly fine with sub optimal and inconsistent frame rated, doesn’t really care about needing the best iq in their gaming etc... You are acting like the majority of gamers have a core/hardcore gamer mentality. They don’t.

Consoles are generally loss leaders that are sold with the intention that you compensate for said loss with game sales or other revenue streams (online service subs). More people own PCs than they do consoles, and you don't need to manufacture hardware at a loss to sell to them as a result. Same goes for mobile. You keep the console as an option (though the majority of your business will come from other platforms) for budget folks or those who don't want to jump through the hurdle of buying a new PC due to confusion or other factors. You sell more games, you make more money. The more platforms you can sell stuff on, the more games you sell. That's why xCloud and Game Pass exist, because once they reach maturity it'll potentially let you play hundreds and hundreds of games that were on console on your phone or PC. EA Access and PlayStation Now we're established with a similar model in mind, and Ubisoft is also keen to pivot. I know you love to wave your ""Next Xbox will be the last"" flag, but that's the entire idea. You won't need an Xbox when everything is conveniently available on a device you already own. You're not playing a console, you're playing the games which are the real money maker from the get go.",,Coolman_Rosso,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

But unless some ground breaking new tech is present, it would be a small jump than the one we had when passing from last generation to the current. 720p to 1080p is a 2,25x increase in resolution. 1080p to 4K is a 4x increase in resolution. If we divide the Gflops/Tflops we had/have by the 720p/1080p, we can get the gain of flops per pixel we had on the generation jump. To get the exact same jump from the current generation to a next one at 4K we would need more than 26 Tflops (just do the math). This will not be achieved for next generation. It would be too expensive. But we can get by with a lot less. Using reconstruction tecniques like the PS4 Pro does, we can reduce the Tflops needs to about 13 Tflops. With these 13 Tflops we could have all current gen games at native 4K, 60 fps (Due also to Zen), and a new generation, with exact the same gains over the current one that we had on the current over the previous, at checkerboard rendering, or other similar tech. Once again this is just math. 10 Tflops would be a gain alright. It would be suficient. But owners of mid generation consoles will shure be disapointed by it. The jump on those cases would be small on the GPU side. According to Tweaktown , Navi 10 will be able to reach up to 30 Tflops. This seems to mean that a cheaper and with lower clocks version of it can easily get to about 13. Without any ground breaking new tech that allows performance gains, thats about the performance I'm betting on. Click to expand... What about 120hz. 26TF is only enough is you stay at 30/60. 60 should be the basement going forward, IMHO. ====================::==================== I think it's quite a useful metric, seeing as Sony's first party efforts have done quite a good job of providing a stellar 4K image, with a fairly paltry 4.2TF. With that in mind, 3 times the GPU grunt, along with at least double the quantity and bandwidth of memory, and a vastly superior CPU seems like a pretty satisfying generational leap IMO. But the fact that Google and Microsoft are both getting aboard the PSNow train provides further reason to launch with two tiers IMO.

Is it even theoretically possible to do full speed ps3 emulation with current tech? On a console (ps5) it could probably be possible with extensive per title optimisation. Would that optimization be worth it for 3rd parties? Most likely not. Even for 1st parties I doubt it would push the sales of ps3 titles. The amount of power needed for brute force emulation for a generic emulator to run any game, I think its beyond what a console Zen can do. The CELL really was a unique CPU. The problem isn't the main core, as that is a normal power pc core with some extra instruction set, the problem is the SPUs, that have a unique architecture and their own instruction set, and the later games on the console had code fine tuned per SPU to get the most out of the hardware.

Its not something that is gonna change from one day to another and in fact it all depends if it takes off or not. Consoles as I say aren't going anywhere for the time being but as much as we are against it we all have to face reality. The reality is that we belong to a small amount of gamers this days as those ""2 billion"" casual gamers and many other ones outnumber us by far. The reality is that a lot of consoles and game sales are from casual gamers and not from the hardcore anymore. Because of that the whole industry is shifting to that direction as there is tons of cash to be made. Look at games like PUBG, Fornite, Minecraft, Call of Duty and many others. We all agree that games such as God of War, Uncharted, Horizon Zero dawn, Forza Horizon 4, Gears, Monster Hunter World and many others are far better than those games but reality says otherwise as those games outnumber by far all those titles combined. [B]""If Sony refuses to join this game streaming route, Sony probably will be my most respected company.""[/B] Sony is actually the company that tried first this generation or are you forgetting about PSNow? they are even trying to improve the service so they aren't refusing at all and if it takes off I highly doubt they are going to stay hand-crossed. That service hasn't been a success for Sony because they lack the infrastructure to pull this off properly. In fact even Nintendo is testing streaming in Japan with some titles so i guess is obvious what's going on. There are only 3 big players in this world capable of pulling that off and those are Google, Amazon and Microsoft and all the 3 are working on streaming services. As I say streaming is optional and is going to stay like that for a very long period of time i believe. Why is streaming that important? many countries around the globe have excellent internet connection and providing such a option is perfect for their needs. For instance [USER=100781]Thanakil[/USER] spent 400 bucks i guess for a PS4 Pro just to play Red Dead Redemption 2 a game that sadly isn't on PC. Imagine if he had the type of mobile connection i have with up to 160mbits and unlimited? he may not agree now but i bet he would at least consider to use such a service and play the game on PC instead by streaming it if it works well and save money. Right now it sounds bad for us and in reality it has many downsides too but we shouldn't forget that we purchase digital games nowdays and no matter what we don't have any type of ownership on those games except the permanent use as long as the service they are tied on is available. Streaming isn't any different you just have the freedom to choose anytime where to play your games.",,@ruantec,,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

[/b]“We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations.”[/b] Microsoft has built custom hardware for its datacenters, as The Verge previously exclusively reported, so that existing and future Xbox games will be compatible with the services. Games will be streamed to devices, and Microsoft has been testing the xCloud service with Xbox wireless controllers connected to consoles, mobile devices, and PCs. Microsoft says its research teams are “creating ways to combat latency” via advanced network techniques combined with video encoding and decoding. This should make game streaming viable on 4G networks, too. Public trials of the service will begin next year, and Microsoft’s Xbox game streaming service will face competition from a variety of existing services. The most popular include GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Microsoft’s xCloud unveiling comes just days after Google announced its own Project Stream service that will let testers play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop. Microsoft isn’t revealing exactly what it’s doing differently than the competition, but we’ll find out more details when public testing starts in 2019. Click to expand... So what do you think? - Is dedicated console gaming finally coming to its death? - Is this the wave of the future, now with WiFi 6 recently announced, which also is starting in 2019 and it promises less lag, and more people having gigabit internet in their homes, we might just be nailing down the coffin shut finally on are be-loved consoles, so use them while you can, as death is staying over them!

Very pro-consumer move from Sony. Still exclusives. Otherwise if these are not exclusives then there has never been a thing as a exclusive video game since streaming a game through another system has always been possible one way or another. Technically, until Sony ends the streams for these games for other platforms, they're currently multiplat. But at least it's only select games right now. I don't agree, if we allow this to take away exclusivity then the term exclusive loses its sense completely. You would need a bunch of mental gymnastics to say why these are not exclusives but emulated games are still or a game that can be streamed by other means is. It opens up a bunch of exceptions over more exceptions. Better just leave the term exclusive as it was originally intended: a game that can run natively on a particular systems architecture. But this is an official channel from Sony to allow people to play the games. If it can be played on more than one platform = multiplat. Being run from a hard drive or not doesn't change that. I wouldn't lose sleep over it though. If Sony put all of their current first party games on the service, then that would be a BIG uh oh. It's still more optimal to play the games on native hardware anyway, but PSNow is okay enough for plebs, I haven't really had problems with it when I used it.",,BenjaminBanklin,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I don’t think anything from 6th gen up would work on anything but the fastest connections. It's an option... not a requirement. A traditional system will be released along side any ""Streaming Only"" consoles that MS releases. SpikeTheSpaceCo WINS! FATALITY! Look at it this way, I can be playing a game on my NextBox, have to go to work, save my game and have it upload to The Cloud then whip out my phone on the bus and continue from exactly where I was using Streaming, save my progress and then get right back to my new save point and progress when I get home to my Console. And you win at not looking at the big picture. What game are you gonna play on your current gen system and then play on your phone? Your phone service provider would rape you over those data charges. Not to mention most console games control like ass on a smartphone. Playing FF6 on my iPhone is a lesson in patience. @SpikeTheSpaceCo this is the direction hardware companies are heading. They hate having to invest in hardware as that usually nets them little to no money for a few years. And I say you’re isolating people because the streaming service will probably offer titles that you can’t get on a current physical based console (I remember some games on PSNow not being available on the PSN). You do understand that you can use your Wi-Fi... I only have one console, and the idea that I can connect to my Wi-Fi, go upstairs to bed and still play my game in the comfort of my bed sounds great. I don't understand how people can moan about MS given gamers, you, another option and way to play your games. You either use it or don't... Some people... ‍♂ Skips where I said I used PSNow apprently. On my wi-fi... gasp. Please point out where I say “I hope nobody gets the opportunity to use this”. Gonna have trouble doing so. I stated that current internet infrastructure isn’t ready for this. Something a lot of people who’ve dabbled in game streaming have proven true. It’s nowhere near as reliable as having the 1:1 hardware. Your internet infrastructure may not be ready for it... mine is, same as millions of others. I suggest you ask your parents to change Ooh how mature. Grow up bro. There’s dozen of locations in one of the most expensive locations in NYC, that doesn’t get Verizon fios.

Yeah. The only thing I see as different is that they're saying that it will work with all Xbox One games. That could be a game changer if it means they will all be available to stream. They haven't said anything about it working with all Xbox One games. In fact it was made clear that getting games onto the platform would require additional work, which basically excludes a number of games where the developer/publisher has gone bankrupt, the license holder has no interest in putting the games on the service, or where additional licensing restrictions prevent the re-issuing of the game. WOW, have you not read the most recent articles? Literally everything you just said is FALSE. Phil said it won't take any extra effort from developers. You are also conflating Game Pass with xCloud, 2 different things. xCloud will allow you to play ANY of the XBOX library games anywhere, on almost every device. xCloud will not be a paid streaming service, it will be no different than purchasing games now, except you will now have the ability to stream that game anywhere you are. Go read some articles instead of pretending you know what you're talking about. I already stated that my phrasing of calling it work was incorrect as I was referring to the licensing from the rights holder. And no, you're wrong thinking that you'll be able to play any of the Xbox game library, that's why it specifically states in the article ""game studios only needed to agree to add their game to the library"", which again means it's reliant on the authorization from whatever companies own the rights to the game. SigmaLongshot posted... Precisely - the only difference with THIS technology is, potentially, you can buy a digital version of Halo, then simply access it on ANY device you have your Xbox application on. And, simply conjecture, but that may mean depending on the device you access your games from, you get better performance (a phone might offer a bit less oomph than a high-end PC, for example). The whole point is ELIMINATION OF A TETHER. With the Wii U, it was being unable to take your tablet too far from the main unit. With PSVITA play of PS4 games, you were required to have a PS4 on nearby. With this, we could potentially see the elimination of any ""hub"" hardware altogether - it'd be completely remote. And, instead of the device being a bespoke, made-for-purpose proprietary device (ie, ""you can play your Xbox games on the Xbox Handheld which has the Xbox official connectors"") you can literally use ANY device that can accept the application. Groundbreaking stuff. That's actually the same situation as Playstation Now: any device that has the application could play the service's full library of games. You could use it on PS3, Vita, PC, PS4, even Smart TVs, and access not only the games themselves but also your saves with any suitable internet connection (they have recently dropped support for the PS3, Vita, and Smart TV app, however). OnLive also worked the same way, being usable across their set top box, PCs, smartphones, and tablets. As an aside, the Vita can still connect to a PS4 online through Remote Play, close proximity is not required. In fact, this concept isn't even new to this generation: the PSP could actually remote play online to the PS3 as well, although playing games through remote play required the feature to be built into them (which few did). Why are you assuming that devs won't want to be a part of this. There is literally no leg work for them, so it's a win win. Your argument has nothing to stand on, besides your 'nay-say'. This isn't the same as game pass.",,SpikeTheSpaceCo,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware.

Its not like Sony don't have a successful platform to piggyback it off either when PS4 has literally outsold Xbox 2:1 this gen. MS surely talk a good game but they've failed to deliver as often as they've succeeded, I mean how many years is it now since they teased Crackdown 3's ""power of the cloud"" destruction system and not only has the game not been launched, they haven't even trailered the tech in ages. Same deal with their augmented reality HoloLens system, shows great at E3 then a year later it comes out that the consumer version is $3000 and not a word is heard about it again in 2 years. Looking past the hype MS have actually achieved remarkably little. One X is a nice piece of kit but all it appears to have achieved is tp make the One S look underpowered and redundant, it certainly hasn't increased their marketshare. Sure their revenue has increased but unit sales, which are kinda important given that the bulk of income is coming from software licensing haven't. Same deal with backwards compatibility, again its a great positive for users but its had very little appreciable impact on sales, and objectively can never be a growth element going forwards as that old software depreciates with age. If its not driving momentum now, why would it be doing more in say 5 years hence? Its not like its evolving, its a static body of product. I think Sony's relatively restrained PR has been the smart play here. MS are literally throwing the kitchen sink at getting their profile up and yet still by all competitive metrics aren't gaining ground. The reality of course is that there's absolutely nothing stopping Sony from adopting any or all of MS strategies themselves in the future. If they want to make a big deal about BC, they can do once they have tech powerful enough to easily emulate the CELL, and should they wish to dig deep back into the PS2/PS1/Vita/PSP back-catalogue they have vastly more material to work with than MS do. PSNow now folds Gamepass-like functionality into its offering, and already offers a proven streaming service for games. PS4 Pro was the first real mid-gen upgrade so even beat One X to the punch on that score, synergizing really well with PSVR which again is another forwards looking offering that is ripe for incremental upgrading as the tech matures. Sony are in a ridiculously strong position, and while yes it is absolutely possible that they could fuck it all up by making unwise choices at the generational transition, I just don't see it. Partly because we already know that the next generation is going to be an evolution rather than a revolution thanks to continuity in tech partner, but mainly because every decision they've made this gen indicates that they understand the importance of the two most critical factors in determining mass-market success: Price point and software line-up. The things that crippled the PS3 despite its multimedia capabilities and its complete backwards compatibility. I think people are excited about the possibility of game streaming from MS side. Yes Sony has had streaming for a few years now, but it's had issues, and has been flat out poor at times. People want to see someone else's crack at it. The rest of your post is mostly fallacies and Sony praising. Xbox YoY growth is pretty impressive. Not sure why you would blatantly lie about that. It ruins any credibility you might have.",,Foxbat,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

In fact it was made clear that getting games onto the platform would require additional work, which basically excludes a number of games where the developer/publisher has gone bankrupt, the license holder has no interest in putting the games on the service, or where additional licensing restrictions prevent the re-issuing of the game. WOW, have you not read the most recent articles? Literally everything you just said is FALSE. Phil said it won't take any extra effort from developers. You are also conflating Game Pass with xCloud, 2 different things. xCloud will allow you to play ANY of the XBOX library games anywhere, on almost every device. xCloud will not be a paid streaming service, it will be no different than purchasing games now, except you will now have the ability to stream that game anywhere you are. Go read some articles instead of pretending you know what you're talking about. I already stated that my phrasing of calling it work was incorrect as I was referring to the licensing from the rights holder. And no, you're wrong thinking that you'll be able to play any of the Xbox game library, that's why it specifically states in the article ""game studios only needed to agree to add their game to the library"", which again means it's reliant on the authorization from whatever companies own the rights to the game. SigmaLongshot posted... Precisely - the only difference with THIS technology is, potentially, you can buy a digital version of Halo, then simply access it on ANY device you have your Xbox application on. And, simply conjecture, but that may mean depending on the device you access your games from, you get better performance (a phone might offer a bit less oomph than a high-end PC, for example). The whole point is ELIMINATION OF A TETHER. With the Wii U, it was being unable to take your tablet too far from the main unit. With PSVITA play of PS4 games, you were required to have a PS4 on nearby. With this, we could potentially see the elimination of any ""hub"" hardware altogether - it'd be completely remote. And, instead of the device being a bespoke, made-for-purpose proprietary device (ie, ""you can play your Xbox games on the Xbox Handheld which has the Xbox official connectors"") you can literally use ANY device that can accept the application. Groundbreaking stuff. That's actually the same situation as Playstation Now: any device that has the application could play the service's full library of games. You could use it on PS3, Vita, PC, PS4, even Smart TVs, and access not only the games themselves but also your saves with any suitable internet connection (they have recently dropped support for the PS3, Vita, and Smart TV app, however). OnLive also worked the same way, being usable across their set top box, PCs, smartphones, and tablets. As an aside, the Vita can still connect to a PS4 online through Remote Play, close proximity is not required. In fact, this concept isn't even new to this generation: the PSP could actually remote play online to the PS3 as well, although playing games through remote play required the feature to be built into them (which few did).",,Solis,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

While you can upgrade the storage in modern consoles many don't know how (I'm not one of them but just saying), the amount of storage you get is simply not adequate going forward (my PS4 I believe has 500GB and I only have a handful of games yet and having to delete games to install new ones). If you have the internet speeds that can handle this kind of service it's very good for gamers, moving to a Netflix type subscription where you can play hundreds of games with no commitment is quite appealing, and storage no longer is an issue. I'm competitive in my online games so I'd never want to use this type of service for an online game (But I'd also not play competitive games on consoles given the choice), but I see no reason why I would not play a single player game this way. I tried Googles Project stream on my laptop and it was flawless.. I want to play the game it loads up in an instant.. it's impressive. Early on such services were horrid (Onlive comes to mind) but ever since PSNow and Geforce Now they have been quite impressive, if you get a solid selection of games for a good monthly price, this can be huge.

The colors may be a little dim, but that’s very much par for the course with streaming game.

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== Well that confirms it, no PS5 until 2022!",,infectedkid6,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

Seems like the people seemingly angry about this non-announcement are from the same faction that is, indeed, the butt of this joke. We got a winner :). PS5 becoming a streaming platform would be an egregious misstep for Sony. Especially after the Xbox One got burned at the stake for being online only (alongside other shortcomings in its announcement). Globally, the required infrastructure doesn't exist to support a solely streaming platform. You'd be alienating a lot of potential customers, and even of those that do have the internet capabilities to support streaming PS5 games, a good portion of them prefer owning physical copies. Although with Project Stream from Google, Playstation Now's growth, Microsoft's xCloud, and the growing portion of online sales relative to physical, we might see streaming platforms pop up much further down the line.

Here's the info from the SW guide: ""Absolute exclusivity, which the old metagame favored, is still the gold standard, of course. But it is no longer viable in the present day marketplace. Absolute exclusives really don' exist- even first party games are often shared with PCs and smartphones sometimes, now. So what definition of exclusives are we using? That will depend on the context of the discussion, and that's the beauty of it. Calling Street Fighter V a PS4 exclusive in context of a PS4 vs Xbox One discussion is perfectly acceptable, as is calling ReCore an Xbox One exclusive."" TLDR: things like Play Anywhere and PSNow don't change much - if it's on PC then it's an exclusive when comparing PS4 and Xbox, and it's not an exclusive when comparing PS4 or Xbox to PC. The issue of remote hardware with a streaming service isn't addressed. But if you want my honest opinion, here it is: the same rules should apply. Here's why - 1) until I see a link, PSNow is running PS4 games on servers, not PS4s. It makes no sense for them to do otherwise and the PS3 farm some of you cite isn't evidence. That's a special case because the ps3 would have to be emulated on a server and emulating it was a bitch at the time the service was built. The PS4 is an x86 machine running a FreeBSD OS. There is no need for building a special PS4 farm for streaming PSNow games. 2) if your main rebuttal is ""Yeah well it's not run locally"" then strap yourself in - because it looks like streaming is going to be embraced hard by both Sony and MS and I guess that means nobody gets any exclusives any more? 3) it's too pedantic. If you disagree with my points 1+2 then you are already agreeing with this one. IMO SW will die if the rules are too complicated and if games coming to PC mean console gamers no longer have games to argue about. So keep it simple and accept the concept of ""console exclusive"" is more often the rule than the exception now",,xantufrog,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Free Backwards compat. is way ahead on Xbox. Upscaled to 4K and everything else improved. 2. 4K BR Playback is at least available on XB1S and XB1X 3. HDMI In 4. XBox Game Pass is cheaper and better than PSNow (point of contention, I know but when you can get day and date exclusives on it, it's pretty compelling). Games are the number 1 factor for most people and Sony's library far outshines Xbox's. Only Nintendo can potentially make a case otherwise. All of those things u listed will likely be in next gen consoles where things like 4k will truly be fleshed out. Hardware wise no one is denying that the one X is a good value proposition (best in fact) but there are others like me who also have gaming PCs, media centre PCs etc that can play most Microsoft games. In the end, I believe it should come down to games and whichever ones your friends and family play on. Owning more than one console also helps if you can afford time and money wise. ====================::==================== I only play games on it and don't give a dam about blu-ray.

Its not like Sony don't have a successful platform to piggyback it off either when PS4 has literally outsold Xbox 2:1 this gen. MS surely talk a good game but they've failed to deliver as often as they've succeeded, I mean how many years is it now since they teased Crackdown 3's ""power of the cloud"" destruction system and not only has the game not been launched, they haven't even trailered the tech in ages. Same deal with their augmented reality HoloLens system, shows great at E3 then a year later it comes out that the consumer version is $3000 and not a word is heard about it again in 2 years. Looking past the hype MS have actually achieved remarkably little. One X is a nice piece of kit but all it appears to have achieved is tp make the One S look underpowered and redundant, it certainly hasn't increased their marketshare. Sure their revenue has increased but unit sales, which are kinda important given that the bulk of income is coming from software licensing haven't. Same deal with backwards compatibility, again its a great positive for users but its had very little appreciable impact on sales, and objectively can never be a growth element going forwards as that old software depreciates with age. If its not driving momentum now, why would it be doing more in say 5 years hence? Its not like its evolving, its a static body of product. I think Sony's relatively restrained PR has been the smart play here. MS are literally throwing the kitchen sink at getting their profile up and yet still by all competitive metrics aren't gaining ground. The reality of course is that there's absolutely nothing stopping Sony from adopting any or all of MS strategies themselves in the future. If they want to make a big deal about BC, they can do once they have tech powerful enough to easily emulate the CELL, and should they wish to dig deep back into the PS2/PS1/Vita/PSP back-catalogue they have vastly more material to work with than MS do. PSNow now folds Gamepass-like functionality into its offering, and already offers a proven streaming service for games. PS4 Pro was the first real mid-gen upgrade so even beat One X to the punch on that score, synergizing really well with PSVR which again is another forwards looking offering that is ripe for incremental upgrading as the tech matures. Sony are in a ridiculously strong position, and while yes it is absolutely possible that they could fuck it all up by making unwise choices at the generational transition, I just don't see it. Partly because we already know that the next generation is going to be an evolution rather than a revolution thanks to continuity in tech partner, but mainly because every decision they've made this gen indicates that they understand the importance of the two most critical factors in determining mass-market success: Price point and software line-up. The things that crippled the PS3 despite its multimedia capabilities and its complete backwards compatibility.",,Clear,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Yeah, you're kind of done with here with using Rainway. It's nothing like this PSN streaming which does not require you to physically own or borrow a PS4 from someone. Well PSNow is the equivalent of renting a PS4 remotely so you could actually just rent a PC with games somewhere and let this service running and stream the games from your PS4. But actually the installing Linux option is better since it would put the PS4 on first place since you could potentially run more games than on PC on it.",,Zappat,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Onlive and Gaikai were bought by Sony and that tech is now part of PSNow. That's the levels of latency you can expect from this (maybe a little more lag in Europe and Asia depending on how many xbox blade farms they install there). The connection required for this one is 10mbps but they may be trying to push a higher res or something. The issue I have with this tech is that it eats data fast. 2.3 Gb an hour. That's fine for me at home but that is an automatic no for me when I'm on my phone. This is why I think PSNow stopped supporting the android app. In most places there are data caps on mobile data plans and that would eat my monthly data in one sittiing, the Smart TV/At-home crowd was also just not worth chasing as a reason to support the android app because most people probably didn't use it and used their PC or console anyway.

Free Backwards compat. is way ahead on Xbox. Upscaled to 4K and everything else improved. 2. 4K BR Playback is at least available on XB1S and XB1X 3. HDMI In 4. XBox Game Pass is cheaper and better than PSNow (point of contention, I know but when you can get day and date exclusives on it, it's pretty compelling). Games are the number 1 factor for most people and Sony's library far outshines Xbox's. Only Nintendo can potentially make a case otherwise. All of those things u listed will likely be in next gen consoles where things like 4k will truly be fleshed out. Hardware wise no one is denying that the one X is a good value proposition (best in fact) but there are others like me who also have gaming PCs, media centre PCs etc that can play most Microsoft games. In the end, I believe it should come down to games and whichever ones your friends and family play on. Owning more than one console also helps if you can afford time and money wise. ====================::==================== Screw Sony. I buy games pretty regularly and a lot of indie titles.

178857728111,10/8/2018,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/178857728111,"A patent filed by Sony suggests the company may be looking into backwards compatibility on newer consoles. The newly published patent, originally filed in November 2016, was titled “remastering by emulation.” It describes a method of spiffing up old games by remastering old textures on the fly.

Eurogamer reports that the full application explains how it could take files from “legacy software” and essentially replace them with higher-resolution assets, allowing the game to use the same framework while rendering better-looking textures or audio files. The result would essentially be the same as many remastered games we’ve seen with higher textures, but with significantly less work for developers.

“The original software is then played on the higher resolution display, with asset (such as texture) calls being intercepted, identified, and the data structure entered to retrieve the remastered asset having a matching identifier,” the application states. “The remastered asset is then inserted on the fly into the game presentation.”

It’s difficult to say just how this technology could manifest. Sony may be looking forward to the next generation of consoles like the PS5 and planning how it could allow backwards compatibility, or this could even be the tech currently applied to remasters.

Sony has shown disinterest in backwards compatibility as a feature. It introduced the PlayStation 3 with hardware-based backwards compatibility but then dropped it from later models. On PlayStation 4 it has never offered the feature, instead relying on services like PlayStation Now and standalone re-releases.

PlayStation Europe head Jim Ryan said last year that backwards compatibility is “one of those features that is much requested, but not actually used much.” Its competitor, Microsoft, introduced software-based backwards compatibility in 2015, and has been developing a growing list of available titles ever since. At the time, Sony exec Shuhei Yoshida said the development wouldn’t change its approach.

“Backward compatibility is hard,” Yoshida said. “I won’t say we’ll never do it, but it’s not an easy thing to do. If it was easy we would have done that.”

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service.

Thanks to the same x86 architecture, it makes BC easy and cheap to port. PS5 will surely have a Ryzen CPU but don't expect a full desktop Ryzen; it most likely will have a low power mobile version found in laptops to keep temperatures, wattages and costs down but still it will be miles better than Jaguar. With Ryzen, 60fps standard is possible unless devs prioritize eyecandy, which will most likely be the case again sadly. Click to expand...

Specifically, Halo 3... Best forge mode/multiplayer. My first Halo. I often consider purchasing an Xbone just for that. As for the Playstation, I miss Killzone - so nostalgic for the first one - but I've pretty much come to the conclusion that PS4 sucks with it's no backwards compatibility and only few games (no Killzone 1 or 2, only 4) on PSNow. :2018saliengoo1: Right. Xbox One has more than 500+ back compatible titles in its library and adds a few more every week. Aside from Xbox exclusives it includes titles like Witcher 2 which isn't available on the PS3 or PS4 but can be played on PC and Red Dead Redemption which is not available on PC but has a buggy inferior version on the PS3. Both titles are enhanced to 4K on the Xbox One X with higher framerates, decreased loading times and better textures and is considered the definitive version for the game. Both games have elicited high praise on the Xbox One X. They also include Xbox 360 exclusives like Saints Row 1, the highly praised debut edition of the very popular Saints Row series, that can only be played on the Xbox platform(Xbox 360 and Xbox One via BC) and nowhere else. They even started adding to the BC list many of the popular games from the OG Xbox series(30+ and rising) like SWKotor 1 and 2, SW Battlefront 1 and 2, SW Republic Commando, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, Morrowind, Jade Empire, Crimson Skies, Destroy All Humans, Panzer Dragoon Orta and Ninja Gaiden Black, at 16x or more(on the Xbox One X console) the resolution of the original games. I read that the Halo 5 Guardians multiplayer is just as good or even better than Halo 3's, although I haven't actually played it yet. The single player campaign though is somewhat disappointing according to some. Some of the Halo 5 multiplayer section is free to play I believe on the Windows store on PC.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Attention Microsoft - RE: Attention LionHead - Fable 2 Petition,,,

If you have the internet speeds that can handle this kind of service it's very good for gamers, moving to a Netflix type subscription where you can play hundreds of games with no commitment is quite appealing, and storage no longer is an issue. I'm competitive in my online games so I'd never want to use this type of service for an online game (But I'd also not play competitive games on consoles given the choice), but I see no reason why I would not play a single player game this way. I tried Googles Project stream on my laptop and it was flawless.. I want to play the game it loads up in an instant.. it's impressive. Early on such services were horrid (Onlive comes to mind) but ever since PSNow and Geforce Now they have been quite impressive, if you get a solid selection of games for a good monthly price, this can be huge. I appreciate the explanation, but I can see why there's a lack of interest on the forum now. I feel like we're already at the point where we can easily build up hundreds of games in our libraries.

Now, Microsoft has announced its own approach to streaming video games: Project xCloud. The project aims to bring console-quality games to PC, consoles, and smart phone devices, and it will be rolling out public trials starting in 2019.

As detailed in the announcement, players will be able to use an Xbox One controller connected to supported devices. Smart phones can be used via Bluetooth, and a small attachment connects the controller to the phone for ease of use. If you don’t have an Xbox One controller, touch controls are also available.

The service uses Microsoft’s Azure as a backbone to set up new datacenters, with customized hardware that uses the parts of multiple Xbox One consoles. Azure has datacenters in 140 countries, so Microsoft feels it is already in a strong position to roll out the service wide-scale. It’s also developing ways to combat latency, with current tests running at 10 megabits per second. The ultimate goal is to make streaming available on 4G networks. Microsoft also notes the intention is for developers to be able to make their games available through xCloud without requiring any additional work from them (not unlike how it handles backwards compatibility on Xbox One).

Similarly, last week Google announced its own Project Stream, using Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to issue a technical test.

According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar.""

Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== I wonder what's historically been the timeline from when they've announced they're working on a console to that console's release?

Click for full size Quote: : Microsoft Announces Xbox Game Streaming Service Today, Microsoft announced its plans to enter the world of video game streaming with Project xCloud, an ambitious service with a silly title that promises to allow the streaming of Xbox One games across computers, phones, and tablets. Microsoft says its currently testing out Project xCloud and plans to open up tests to the public next year. In a blog post, the company said that game developers will be able to support the streaming service with no additional work, and that in addition to trying to solve the big ol latency problem (with Microsofts many datacenters), the team is developing a new, game-specific touch input overlay for controller-free playing. Our goal with Project xCloud is to deliver a quality experience for all gamers on all devices thats consistent with the speed and high-fidelity gamers experience and expect on their PCs and consoles, the company said. This news comes just a week after Google announced its own stab at the streaming world, Project Stream, which entered a closed beta test this weekend and allows users to play Assassins Creed Odyssey in a Google Chrome tab. https://kotaku.com/microsoft-announc...ice-1829595928 ====================::==================== I stream my pc to my phone with a couple of different methods and the latency with the signal going five feet is unacceptable for most types of gaming imo.

The thing is, it also includes all in one; streaming, download for PS4 games (like Game Pass), and you do not need Plus for multiplayer on it. Unless MS looks to combine all 3 as well (which as of now, it does not appear that way), then it will be more expensive and an (OCD) billing mess to sub to 3 separate services. But I do expect it (PSNow) to be cheaper (eventually) if competition wills it of course. Last edited: Today at 3:05 PM",,DeepEnigma,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,
