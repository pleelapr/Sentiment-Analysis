I don't think it will be that bleak at least until all games become ""streaming only"" such as OnLive / Playstation Now where you truly do not own the game. If anything consider Steam as the counter argument. Sure the sales aren't what they used to be but you can still typically get good games 75% off. GoG is even better but obviously a lot of publishers want DRM.",,rybxjfpq,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Anyways, last time Sony did backwards compatibility they released a $599 console so I personally believe the PS5 wont be BC to keep down costs. I expect them to say something like ""If you want BC sign up for PSNOW."" Microsoft on the other hand will at least have Xbox One full BC and maybe what we already have with 360 and OG. It would be a huge pull for casual gamers, launching a console that will have 100s of playable games on launch day and your competitor may have 5. All 3rd party games will look and run better on Xbox, if they can actually get that there is your hardcore fanbase right there that care about specs. Halo Infinite will be a launch title, much like BOTW was for Switch. I cant figure out if The Initiative will have their game ready for launch or if they are the year after release like Odyssey was for Nintendo. Lastly, I still think Scarlett will have a gimmick, just not a forced one like Kinect. There has to be something it does that PS5 won't and it cant be something that will jack up the base price of the console. So whether it has something to do with GamePass, or a revamp of achievements that get you free content, or full crossplay between Switch and Xbox.",,Jiggy101011,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Sure, he still does kill a god in the new game but that's not his core motivation, infact we see him want to do the opposite, with his intentions now of being a benevolent god that simply wants to protect and do right by his son. There was real character development during the course of the game and I really feel if there were one character that could be seen as the face of Playstation now Nate is gone, he is it. With that said, I don't think Playstation has a 'mascot' per say or necessarily needs one like Nintendo or Xbox, they have quite a few heavy hitting exclusives so they don't really need to rely on one.",,-Vertex-,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

They need to knock it out of the park with exclusives with the next console. Otherwise just give it up. Microsoft just started a gaming studio and bought 4 more studios as announced at E3. They are even opening to adding more. It is just a matter of time before they catch up on exclusives. In the meantime they just keep on adding features on their Xbox One console, while Sony has stopped doing that, relying mostly on their exclusives. 4 or 5 years into the life cycle of their system. Same promises every year. As I said when it comes to exclusives they are taking steps to catch up. However when it comes to features, it is not even close. Features on the Xbox One X console not found on the PS4: 4K HDR Blu Ray Player Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Game Pass - subscription service that allows Xbox gamers to access the latest games and not just old ones like on PSNow EA Access - subscription service that allows access to EA games that is not available on the Sony consoles Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform.

In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti consumer practices. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy.

Tens of thousands of Fortnite players have been infected by malware that hijacks encrypted Web sessions so it can inject fraudulent ads into every website a user visits, an executive with a game-streaming service said Monday.

Rainway CEO Andrew Sampson said in a blog post that company engineers first detected the mass infections last week when server logs reported hundreds of thousands of errors. The engineers soon discovered that the errors were the result of ads that somehow were injected into user traffic. Rainway uses a technique known as whitelisting that permits customers to connect only to approved URLs. The addresses hosting the fraudulent addresses—hosted on the adtelligent.com and springserve.com domains—along with unauthorized JavaScript that accompanied them made it clear the traffic was generated by malware infecting a large number of game players using the Rainway service. Rainway is a cloud-based service that lets people play PC games remotely, similar to PlayStation Now.

“As the errors kept flowing in, we took a glance at what these users had in common,” Sampson wrote. “They didn’t share any hardware, their ISPs were different, and all of their systems were up to date. However, one thing did stand out—they played Fortnite.”

People buy consoles because of exclusives in most cases. You’d still be playing the same third party titles regardless. @mrhappyguy12345 Not me. The majority of titles I've bought this gen have been multi platform. Although there definitely are some series I would consider getting a second console this gen for(a new Fable that's good, for example). But for me the majority of stuff I've bought has been available either across the board(Sony, MS AND Nintendo) or at least on Sony and Microsoft's platforms with the only exception being No Man's Sky which I bought to be able to explore vast numbers of worlds and name stuff with random and wacky names for the laughs it'd provide to me. muggy posted... I'll whine and cry and demand that sony needs to listen to me because I'm special. @muggy Having more options is NOT a bad thing. For example Microsoft providing backwards compatibility with some original Xbox and Xbox 360 games this gen. I would LOVE to see Sony do that with the PS4 so I could play the games I still have in my backlog from last gen that I can no longer play since I don't have a working PS3 now. But unfortunately instead of making the PS3 easy to program for and eventually emulate on their next console they made last gen's system a nightmare to do anything for. The only 'solutions' they've given us is either re-buying the same games from last gen via ""remasters"" or subscribing to Playstation Now, both of which take more money out of gamer's pockets.",,ThrillKillFan,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,,,,,,,,

I beat them all, meaning the first 4 games and I own the other ones so I'm looking into getting a PS2 slim, they're not expensive so I think it may be worth it just to play all these games again. I do have an old PS2 but it's in pieces and hard to get it going sometimes plus I never had a slim so maybe I'll get it eventually.. I've been a huge fan since the beginning, probably my favorite games and I LOVED the Silent Hill movie! I saw it the night it came out, friend couldn't go so I went by myself and then the next day I went with my friend again! Then I've seen it countless times on DVD and streaming! I liked the 2nd one just not as much. Click to expand... I thought the second movie was an abomination. Can't believe Jon Snow played in that movie lol. He really does know nothing. Silent Hill 3 is the most underrated one in the franchise. People always say SH2 is the best. I can see the arguments there but to me, SH3 was my favorite because it was a direct sequel to SH1. I don't think a lot of people got exposed to the franchise until 2. 1 had a lot of problems and I doubt most players got through that game. I was exposed to it when it came out on PS1 and remembering as a kid that game was very hard for me because my little mind had a hard time understanding resource management for survival. I tried to kill all the enemies which was a mistake. I eventually learned from trial and error though. SH2 was basically everything SH1 was suppose to be and the generational jump to new hardware is what made it happen. Both SH2/SH3 were technical marvels for their times. Thinking back...kinda surprised my parents let a 9-year-old kid play video games like that lol. Click to expand... Growing up my mom said as long as there wasn’t sex, she didn’t care. Sh2 is my favorite still and my favorite survival horror game of all time. 3 was really good and had the best jump scares in the series but I preferred James story and the emotional struggle and the way the town itself actually played a role.",,sean9986,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Will they ever release the Silent Hill Collection on PS4?,,,

175472731759,7/2/2018,http://freeoceanofamespcgames.tumblr.com/post/175472731759,"There is a widespread expectation that consoles will eventually transition entirely to digital gaming in the coming years- whether via streaming, which more and more companies have begun to express interest in, or simply digital downloads. In fact, a recent study by an analyst concluded that games sales will be entirely digital in the next five years.

That may sound ambitious, but fully digital consoles are coming, according to Tancred Dyke-Wells and Neil Millstone – the co-founders of developer Solar Sail Games, the developers of Smoke and Sacrifice. Speaking to GamingBolt, Dyke-Wells and Millstone said that discs and physical games are antiquated technology, and that the popularization of streaming via services such as Netflix and Spotify has changed people’s expectations on how media is delivered or consumed.

“One question I have in mind is whether this will be the generation where the disc drive is lost and the machines become more of an entirely digital, aways-online, Steam-like service offering,” they said in an interview with GamingBolt. “If not, maybe the generation after… but it’s coming. physical discs are old technology. And I think streaming and subscription services like PlayStation Now are likely to become more central to how consumers buy and play – in the same way that Netflix and Spotify have come to define how we consume movies and music. On the other hand, consumer internet still isn’t ideal for delivering the tens of gigabytes that current-gen games consume, so if they’re even bigger next time round, it could mean games on disc stay relevant for a while longer.”

I really hope this isn’t true, to be honest. I’d even be fine with digital download only consoles (most of my game purchases at this point are digital anyway), but a shift to a streaming future for games does not interest me in the slightest. Games are data intensive, and the question of latency simply cannot be sidestepped, it’s a matter of the fundamental laws of physics. I don’t want my gaming experience to be made worse in pursuit of some ideal about the future of gaming- I hope that won’t happen in the future.

Stay tuned for our full interview on Smoke and Sacrifice in the coming days.

As a matter of fact, your disc *can* get scratched or your console *could* break in 15 years. No one can predict the future. >However, I am worried that I won't be able to play games I buy now on Steam in say 15 years or even longer. Remember that when you buy a digital game on Steam you're acquiring a license to use it, not the ownership. >Will Steam still be around for me to download the games I bought? I am sure Steam has a plan to make people create backups of their library before closing. GOG already allows that 'cause it sells DRM-free games, so once you have the files you can store those in any hard-disk and even make multiple copies. Also, Game For Windows Live closed in 2013 but you can still play their games (even if with some troubles). >Will PCs in 15 years be able to run games from that long ago? If you mean hardware and driver compatibility, yes, at least most of the times. 15 years is not much, if we consider 30-40 years then there could be more important changes to PC gaming. You already see that many companies are moving to streaming and online subscriptions (PSNow, Nvidia GeForce Now). I think that there will be many possibilities to *access* games in the future. Emulation is growing strong (Cemu, RPCS3, Yuzu, Ryujinx), piracy is still a thing (until streaming kills it), DRM-free digital games are growing in number thanks to GOG. Whatever happens in the future, the concept of owning and collecting both physical and digital will not have the same importance it had and people will mainly focus on the experience, just like is happening with movies.",,SpeakToTheDevil,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Silent Hill 3 is the most underrated one in the franchise. People always say SH2 is the best. I can see the arguments there but to me, SH3 was my favorite because it was a direct sequel to SH1. I don't think a lot of people got exposed to the franchise until 2. 1 had a lot of problems and I doubt most players got through that game. I was exposed to it when it came out on PS1 and remembering as a kid that game was very hard for me because my little mind had a hard time understanding resource management for survival. I tried to kill all the enemies which was a mistake. I eventually learned from trial and error though. SH2 was basically everything SH1 was suppose to be and the generational jump to new hardware is what made it happen. Both SH2/SH3 were technical marvels for their times. Thinking back...kinda surprised my parents let a 9-year-old kid play video games like that lol. Click to expand...

If a game is playable on a website that means that a user's browser is downloading and running the game instead of that user downloading an executable and running it. What the ASP loophole is describing is software that does not leave the server. A video game example of this would be the world of warcraft (or any multiplayer) server where the only people who ever can run the server code are the creators. All the clients merely talk to the server to figure out what to do, but the logic of the server never gets distributed. Although unlikely, if you are using a game streaming service, similar to [psnow](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-now/) or want to have lets players on youtube or twitch, then that is not distributing the game code, but is distributing art and sound assets.",,ghostnet,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Combat in the early Silent Hills basically boiled down to ""what is the best melee weapon that I can attack with and strafe at the same time, cause I'm gonna use that the whole game"" with bits of ""RUNRUNRUNHOLYSHITRUN"".

I had to do a walkthrough to know where to run to, to get me going. Last time I was practicing how to kill them with melee properly.

The quality is obviously better, but I find it way more tolerable, cause I'm totally into PS2 games....Silent Hill 1 is one of the roughest PS1 era game I've tried to go back and play, then again I got many remastered, like Banjo, THPS, Abe Odyssey and Crash.",,SaltSlasher,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Will they ever release the Silent Hill Collection on PS4?,,,

I could see a system like Xbox where they choose what's bc and you have to download. That way they won't add bc for games they plan on doing a remaster for, or adding to PSNow. I could also see it being for Plus users only. Xbox don't choose what is BC, that's the developers, as it depends on licences etc. All so you don't have to download it.

Revenue from these subscriptions pay for the computer servers used to run the game, the people that manage and oversee the game on a daily basis, and the introduction of new content into the game. Several MMOs offer an initial trial period that allow players to try the game for a limited amount of time, or until their character reaches an experience level cap, after which they are required to pay to continue to play. **Game subscription services** Subscription services like EA Access and Xbox Game Pass grant subscribers complete access to a large library of games offered digitally with no limitations. User need to download these games to their local computer or console to play. However, users must remain subscribed to play these games; the games are protected by digital rights management that requires an active account to play. New games are typically added to the service, and in some cases, games may leave the service, after which subscribers will be unable to play that title. Such services may offer the ability to purchase these titles to own and allow them to play outside of the subscription service. **Cloud gaming** **/ Gaming on demand** Services like PlayStation Now or Gamefly allow players to play games that are run on remote servers on local devices, eliminating the need for specialized console hardware or powerful personal computers, outside of the necessary bandwidth for Internet connectivity. These otherwise operate similar to game services, in that the library of available may be added or removed to over time, depending on the service. **Microtransactions** Microtransactions represent low-cost purchases, compared to the cost of a full game or a large expansion pack, that provide some form of additional content to the purchaser. The type of content can vary from additional downloadable content; new maps and levels for multiplayer games; new items, weapons, vehicles, clothing, or other gear for the player's character; power-ups and temporary buffs; in-game currency, and elements like loot boxesthat provide a random assortment of items and rewards. Players do not necessarily need to purchase these items with real-world funds to acquire them. However, a game's design and financial approach that aims to provide ongoing service is aimed to assure that a small fraction of players will purchase this content immediately rather than grinding through the game for a long time to obtain it. These select ""whales"" providing sufficient revenue to support further development of new content. This approach is generally how free-to-play games like *Puzzle & Dragons*, *Candy Crush Saga*, and *League of Legends* support their ongoing development, as well as used atop full-priced games like *Grand Theft Auto Online* and *Destiny*. **Games may combine one or more of these forms.** A common example are lifestyle games, which provide rotating daily content, which frequently reward the player with in-game currency to buy new equipment (otherwise purchasable with real-world funds), and extended by updates to the overall game. Examples of such lifestyle games include *Destiny* and many MMORPG like *World of Warcraft*. Games as a Service is not a slang for some lizardjewilluminati magic that ruins the whole gaming industry. It's a several decades old model that's used in tons of places.",,dragonoob44,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Let's say they have a damned efficient compression algorithm. So it compresses it 100:1. It is still 10MB/s. Let's round that up to 40GB / hour! So in 2-3 hours you waste more bandwith than the size of any game available now!

All media will be digital and on a cloud and that is how it should be mainly because from a conservation standpoint it'll create less waste on the environment. It's bad enough enough we're plaguing the oceans with our plastic and god knows what else, but we need to transition as a species to a more environmentally conscious society and anything that can distributed or saved on a server or network should be mandatory.... That is until we start talking about Zuckerberg and Bezos pushing your date, which is an t tally different conversation altogether. Click to expand... The ""Cloud"" is a bunch of servers that use a lot of power. And how is most electricity still generated? Fossil fuels. The power use of individual users is not going to be offset by the end user using a lower powered device compared to what we have now. Dead Parrot said: ↑ As far as the streaming only option, I wonder if any of those 'analysts' have played a streamed only game over an internet connection that represents the median speed and ping times in the US? I am guessing that if they would do that and then consider that 50% of the country would have a worse experience then they just did, they might reconsider their projections. Even the digital only option probably screws the lower third or so of the US. A 5 gig update can take hours on a 6mb connection.

If you use YCbCr 4:2:0 you can further decrease bandwidth to a third, or 5 and 10 GB/hr, respectively. Exavior said: ↑ I haven't tried the service but PlayStation Now is a streaming service. It only requires 5Mbps. Playing a game in HD is no different than watching a HD movie on Netflix. Click to expand... PlayStation Now games stream at 30 FPS and 720p. ""Full HD"" 1080p would require at least 10 Mbps, preferably 25. Streaming video isn't the same as streaming a game, though. The former requires no user input, so latency is fine so long as it doesn't degrade the image quality. If you're waiting more than 50ms for your input to translate to movement they you're going to have a bad time. And that is in addition to the input lag of whatever display you're using.",,Armenius,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Video Games Will Be “100% Digital” by 2022 | Page 3,,,

Xbox Scarlett: Five reasons why Sony should be very worried about Microsoft's next console https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/981571/Xbox-Scarlett-Sony-PS5-Microsoft-next-console-release-date-backwards-compatibility The next Xbox will be about gamers first and foremost Unlike the muddled reveal of the Xbox One back in 2013, Scarlett will surely refine Microsoft's strategy of targeting gamers. This means the company will focus on software as the primary selling point of the hardware rather than explaining other entertainment functionality in an attempt to appeal to mass audiences. The unveiling of the Xbox One X showed that Phil Spencer has firmly steered the course of Microsoft's gaming division following a period of mixed messaging under prior leadership. As the announcement of Scarlett at E3 suggested, Microsoft is using the message Sony delivered so elegantly with the PlayStation 4 reveal in 2013 by firmly targeting gamers and relying on them to spread the word to achieve laudable hardware sales. Scarlett looks set to beat the PlayStation 5 to market With industry experts predicting the next Xbox will arrive as early as 2020, and after the head of Sony's PlayStation division, John Kodera, admitting last month the next Playstation is still at least three years away, the next Xbox looks set to begin the next generation. Microsoft coming out of the gates first could provide it with an incredible amount of momentum if, for an entire year, all titles look and perform better on the next Xbox. This, combined with the fact the Xbox One X already packs a ton more power than the PlayStation 4 Pro could be incredibly damaging to Sony. The next Xbox will be a graphical behemoth During the announcement of the next Xbox Phil Spencer confirmed Microsoft was working to once again ""set the benchmark for console gaming"". Such aggressive language from the Xbox boss surely means the Redmond-based company is looking to beat Sony on graphical horsepower, just like it did with Xbox One X. If the console harnesses the latest graphical hardware it means games will surely run at a buttery smooth 60 frames-per-second at a full 4K resolution. Backwards compatibility returns and could force Sony to do the same An area where Microsoft has completely dominated the console space is in the area of backwards compatibility. The company added the feature to the Xbox One in 2015 and has made it easier than ever for users to access a huge back catalogue of last generation titles through its subscription service dubbed Xbox Game Pass. Sony meanwhile has struggled to gain traction with its PlayStation Now subscription service and will surely be forced to ensure its next hardware is able to handle all previous PlayStation 4 titles. Microsoft is serious about delivering top-tier exclusives Microsoft launched an all-out assault on Sony's plethora of top-tier exclusives by announcing it had acquired four new studios and had formed a fifth. All five will be developing titles exclusively for Xbox and will surely take the fight to PlayStation that dominated the current generation with industry-leading software like God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn. I have to agree, Microsoft is indeed firing on all cylinders, including turbo and supercharging. Hard to stop a trillion dollar behemoth. Are you excited for Scarlett? I know I am! Those are all valid reasons. The anti consumer practices Sony is doing at the moment will hurt them in the long run. With real gamers that is not the shills to apologize for them.",,DeadCellScorpio,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Not only is that a long time to wait, there will - (rumor time) - be things you will only really ""get"" in the remake if you played the original.

Well the warmaster version runs full 1080p and 60 FPS if you got it digital or the disc version playing in ps4, so I’d say your doing it wrong Other then that it’s the same game I rather get use to a streaming network and see if they generally run good. A few other streaming networks should be coming out in a year or two. Yeah, I rather have 1080p 60 fps, especially the 60 fps, but overall I can't pass up the value I get with PSNow on PC, and 720p 30 fps is livable (I could probably even make due to an extent in fighting games, which I will be testing in the future, played and beat Mega Man 9 with little to no problems once I got everything set up right). I only had to buy two PS4 controllers and spend $45 to get access to over 600 games (even though some aren't the full versions) for 3 months. It will come out to much less then continuing to purchase games and consoles. Edit: But also did you like the game?",,Mozzezz,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Never played it until the Warmastered Edition, but absolutely loved the game and it’s lore. Bought the 2nd game recently and am currently playing through it but the first game is s amazing. War is just awesome as well, definitely interested in the 3rd game. Glad to hear there is going to be a third game. The second is also available on PSNow. Sheepinator posted... Why would the game being 3D matter? You are streaming video, Netflix style. The issue is gameplay lag, which will be present with a 3D or 2D game because you have to receive the video over the internet rather than have it go via HDMI cable. I have zero interest in such streaming services. I'm not interested in adding lag to the gameplay experience. Specs do matter a little still on your end. Plus I wanted to test their servers. I also wanted to test my Internet connection to see if it could keep up with everything. I figured the whole round trip may be a problem with a graphic intensive game that has the variables of a video game. It's not exactly the same as streaming video because what's being sent is constantly in flux. I could see there potentially being problems along the way, especially the more demanding the game is, and wanted to make sure there wouldn't be. Remember, a streaming video has to buffer to a certain extent. BuyersRemorse55 posted... I could see the potential appeal of streaming services for games, but I think its a long way off. I mean if I could sub to a service on and off and play all the same games I do now with out having to invest in a $400 console, that would be great. But I think for these services to ever really work the experiance is going to have to mirror having the console/pc right in your house. Like when you stream movies or tv, there is no negative, in some ways its better cause with tv there is no commercials if its a show that orignally had them. I get this, but during the start of the HD craze, I was still more interested in youtube with its like 240-480p, so I don't mind somewhat lower specs of games to start. Streaming is just that much more convenient plus you can save a ton of money by playing higher end stuff on lower end devices.",,Mozzezz,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

It's not in direct competition with Xbox and PlayStation now, and that's going to become even more evident when those things become basically desktop PCS that are shaped like consoles. I think it's nice when we can play some of those Triple A games on the go with a Nintendo switch, but you're absolutely right and it's going to get harder and harder because companies are always going to trickle towards the graphical beasts and port to Nintendo as they can. At a certain point there's going to be a diminishing return. it's a shame that gaming is such an expensive hobby, because I honestly believe that most Avid Gamers would be happiest having a Nintendo AND either an Xbox, a PlayStation, or a gaming PC, together in tandem, as opposed to trying to buy a Nintendo and force it to do all of the things that those other consoles do. All that being said, I would love for once to see a triple a gaming company produce a title that is 100% optimized for the switch, and *then* port it to the other guys.

""We don't find 5$ a month are worth for EA Access, but 5$ a month for online and games that nobody cares are perfect."" NINTENDO keeps the physical games alive and they games cost 60$ for years. Microsoft and Sony won't allow you to play any game without downloading the rest of it... Of course a 720p low preset game doesn't fit in a 100GB Blu-Ray. Even though the PC 4K version with Ultra Texture is 60GBB You support the used games. Do you support downloading a game pirated to test it and then buy it? Because, most gamers that download pirated games then buy them. I don't think you buy a copy that support the developers? About saving money. Every week I find sales on steam for a lot of games. Not to mention the crazy Summer, Halloween and Holiday sales. Every consumer wants the best possible game. Companies like Sony can have their DRM on PC and have studios to make games. They don't need to exclude gamers.

175627873514,7/6/2018,http://toptechnewsandbuzz.tumblr.com/post/175627873514,"Game streaming offers an enticing alternative to buying either physical or digital games. Aside from the cost of maintaining a subscription to a streaming service being significantly lower than purchasing new games outright, streaming services also allow you to jump into the action without waiting for huge installations and updates.

In the past, streaming services like OnLive failed to catch on — game streaming isn’t for everyone; however, for players with a good, consistent internet connection and a penchant for jumping from game to game without plans to return to any one title, it’s the perfect option.

Here are some of the best game-streaming services you can try right now, with some game recommendations to give you a sense of the games you’ll get to play on each one.

PlayStation Now



Sony has some of the best first-party video games around, but you previously needed to own one of the company’s consoles in order to play them. With PlayStation Now, you can play a wide variety of exclusive PlayStation games from your PC or your PlayStation 4.

On PC, all you need in a DualShock 4 controller with either a wireless adapter or USB mini cable as well as a PlayStation Network account and at least 5 Mbps of internet download speed. PlayStation 4 users need the same internet speed on their game console, and with either a 7-day free trial or a paid subscription, you’re ready to play the best PlayStation exclusives.

For PS4 players, a PlayStation Now subscription includes full access to multiplayer support, even if you have not subscribed to PlayStation Plus. Your save files will be compatible with on both PC and PS4.

PlayStation Now currently features some older PlayStation exclusives, including Killzone: Shadow Fall, The Last of Us, Until Dawn, and God of War III: Remastered. It also supports a number of third-party games, such as Dishonored, Batman: Arkham Origins, BioShock Infinite, and Saints Row IV. New games are added every month, and the full catalog now includes more than 600 titles. PlayStation Now costs $20 for a one-month subscription, or $45 for a three-month subscription.

GeForce Now



Own a Mac or a low-end PC, but want to play the latest AAA games? With GeForce Now, you can play the latest and greatest from major publishers without having to worry about your computer catching fire or, worse, running Bootcamp.

GeForce Now is not a content service like many of the other services on our list. You have to purchase the games you want to play through a digital store, such as Steam, Uplay, or Blizzard’s Battle.net. Once you’ve installed the app on your machine, GeForce’s cloud-based processors will allow you to run the game on any device, independent of their specs.

The service requires a higher internet download speed than GameFly Streaming – 25 Mbps minimum and 50 Mbps recommended – and you must have MacOS 10.10 or higher or Windows 7 64-bit or later in order to run it. Either an Ethernet connection or a Wi-Fi connection using a 5 GHz router is required, and you can use either a mouse-and-keyboard setup or one of several gamepads. Sessions are currently capped at four hours per player before you have to start a new session in order to keep the servers available for other players.

GeForce now is compatible with a huge assortment of games, though you do have to buy them in order to use them with the service. The list includes Assassin’s Creed Origins, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, Injustice 2, Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, and Middle-earth: Shadow of War, to name a few. GeForce Now is currently in beta testing and is free for users during the trial period. You can sign up for the waitlist on the official website.

Jump



The other game streaming services on our list focus primarily on big-budget AAA games from major publishers. That’s great and all, but there are times when you’re more interested in playing an independent game from a small studio, instead, and Jump is the perfect service to do it.

Jump provides a latency-free game streaming service the company says is on par with what you expect from a game fully installed on your device. Whether you’re gaming on a Windows PC, Linux PC, or Mac, you can play the service’s library of games. It also supports both the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive headsets. Your save data is stored in the cloud, so you can always pick up right where you left off, even if you switch devices. Another neat feature: There are no microtransactions in any of Jump’s games.

The one caveat with Jump is that the technology used – dubbed “HyperJump” – uses your local system hardware in order to run games. This means your system will have to be capable of playing the game, though the majority of the games offered through Jump aren’t particularly taxing.

The roster of games you can play with Jump – all of which are included in the $5 monthly subscription cost – includes well-known indie games such as Cook, Serve, Delicious!, Gunhouse, Nidhogg, and The End is Nigh. New games are added every month, and 70 percent of the proceeds go back to the developers whose games are included in the Jump library. You can try a two-week free trial, and subscriptions can be canceled at any time.

GameFly Streaming



Want to play games, but don’t have a console or a gaming PC? Gamefly Streaming, the digital wing of the “Netflix for Games” service, allows you to play a selection of older AAA games on a variety of streaming devices, including the Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, the EMTEC GEM Box, and both Samsung and LG Smart television sets. GameFly Streaming works with nearly any game controller you’ll find in stores. From the PlayStation 4’s DualShock 4 to the Xbox One gamepad, you can pick whichever one suits you the most.

GameFly Streaming also supports local multiplayer games, so a friend can get in on the action, provided they also have a controller. The service saves your data in the cloud for up to 90 days after you cancel your subscription, so you can restart your membership and pick up right where you left off in your favorite title.

Two different subscription packs – “gamer” and “family” — are available through GameFly Streaming, each for under $10 per month. The service requires a 5 Mbps internet speed and suggests 10 Mbps for the best experience, and it supports both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity. If you already own a device capable of running the GameFly streaming app, you can try it for free right now.

Current games available through GameFly streaming include BioShock and BioShock 2, Clustertruck, Bridge Constructor, and Adventure Time: Finn & Jake Investigations.

Honorable mention: Xbox Game Pass



The other services on our list rely on streaming technology to deliver you your games, but Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass works a little differently. For $10 per month, a subscription to Xbox Game Pass gives you access to more than 100 games, and you download them onto your Xbox One’s storage device just like you would with any other digital game.

This means you don’t have to worry about your internet speed affecting the quality of your game experience, and even if you lose your connection, you’ll still be able to play games.

And the games – the games. Xbox Game Pass has perhaps the best library of free games of any service on our list. From Rise of the Tomb Raider to Gears of War 4, nearly every notable Xbox One game you can think of is included through the program, and a selection of Xbox 360 games are also available through backward compatibility. It isn’t limited to Microsoft-published games, either, with a variety of third-party games also available. The kicker, however, is Microsoft’s policy for future Xbox exclusives. All first-party Xbox games going forward will be included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription at no extra charge on launch day. Sea of Thieves is already available, and big-name games like Crackdown 3 and State of Decay 2 are coming later in 2018.",,toptechnewsandbuzz,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,The Best Game Streaming Services,Post,,

Tens of thousands of Fortnite players have been infected by malware that hijacks encrypted Web sessions so it can inject fraudulent ads into every website a user visits, an executive with a game-streaming service said Monday.

Rainway CEO Andrew Sampson said in a blog post that company engineers first detected the mass infections last week when server logs reported hundreds of thousands of errors. The engineers soon discovered that the errors were the result of ads that somehow were injected into user traffic. Rainway uses a technique known as whitelisting that permits customers to connect only to approved URLs. The addresses hosting the fraudulent addresses—hosted on the adtelligent.com and springserve.com domains—along with unauthorized JavaScript that accompanied them made it clear the traffic was generated by malware infecting a large number of game players using the Rainway service. Rainway is a cloud-based service that lets people play PC games remotely, similar to PlayStation Now.

“As the errors kept flowing in, we took a glance at what these users had in common,” Sampson wrote. “They didn’t share any hardware, their ISPs were different, and all of their systems were up to date. However, one thing did stand out—they played Fortnite.”

If they allow cross console play I'll be happy to make those purchases on PS4. Never mind the fact Sony's attitude on this is pretty much the straw that broke the camel's back, if Sony doesn't change their attitude about backwards compatibility (I expect the PS5 to have PS4, PS3, PS2, and PS1 games that can be played outside of PSNow) and they don't change their stance on cross play, I guarantee you I won't be buying a PS5.",,MarbleFox_,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Tens of thousands of Fortnite players have been infected by malware that hijacks encrypted Web sessions so it can inject fraudulent ads into every website a user visits, an executive with a game-streaming service said Monday.

Rainway CEO Andrew Sampson said in a blog post that company engineers first detected the mass infections last week when server logs reported hundreds of thousands of errors. The engineers soon discovered that the errors were the result of ads that somehow were injected into user traffic. Rainway uses a technique known as whitelisting that permits customers to connect only to approved URLs. The addresses hosting the fraudulent addresses—hosted on the adtelligent.com and springserve.com domains—along with unauthorized JavaScript that accompanied them made it clear the traffic was generated by malware infecting a large number of game players using the Rainway service. Rainway is a cloud-based service that lets people play PC games remotely, similar to PlayStation Now.

“As the errors kept flowing in, we took a glance at what these users had in common,” Sampson wrote. “They didn’t share any hardware, their ISPs were different, and all of their systems were up to date. However, one thing did stand out—they played Fortnite.”

How can you look at the visuals in games such as The Last Of US Part 2, God Of War, Ghosts Of Tsushima and Spider Man and say they aren’t a significant leap over what was possible on PS3? As impressive as late PS3 era games such as Uncharted 3 and The Last Of Us looked at the time, they are noticeably less refined than than modern day and forthcoming PS4 titles. Sony’s output just gets technically better and better every year. I think the fact they are churning out graphics of that calibre on hardware pushing 5 years old should be seen as something of an accomplishment. [/Quote: ] PS4 certainly pushes it even better and is usually now full 1080, except for disappointedly the GTA III, Vice City & San Andreas versions on the store which I hoped would be 1080 to match the PC versions. The jumps from PS1 to PS2, and from PS2 to PS3 just seemed so much more obvious, the PS1 was just a CD reader, then the PS2 was also a DVD player and with much bigger and more expansive games now released on DVD rather than CD as a result, things like Grand Theft Auto III would have been totally impossible on PS1, it was all still SD. Then PS3 comes out and all the graphics go near HD, but 720p and we now get a Blu-Ray player and home multimedia system. PS4's main jump was to improve to full HD with 4K only coming later with the PS4 Pro, we already had a Blu-Ray player, at first it didn't even offer the home multimedia player experience as the ability to play video files only came later, and the PS3 even started with more of the on demand apps as they took a while to come to the PS4 as well. Graphics are even more amazing as a given but the move to PS3 to PS4 was almost more of a moving house sort of feeling, rather than wow that new one does all that now, isn't this current one starting to look a bit pants by comparison can't wait to get it. That was the PS1 to PS2 and PS2 to PS3 sort of feeling, now if you built up a game library on the PS3 you had a load of games some of which were in near HD that they couldn't just let you play again on the PS4 yet could come up with a Playstation Now service to make you pay to play them if it happens to be on the PS4, such as Sonic Generations and Crazy Taxi from the store that would only play on PS3 for example. PS3 to PS4 was more of a, I've got to get those games again new on the new system but can't get all of them sort of situation, I can have IPlayer but All4 is not on it yet, always lose something by moving over to PS4 from PS3 so easier to keep both. So a lot of me when I did get the PS4 after a couple of years was having to pay again to get some of the games again on there as well if I even could in the first place, I'd rather have the complete Playstation in one box, that was only possible whilst the PS3 60 GB model existed that for a time provided the complete box that did all PS1, PS2 & PS3, after they discontinued it it's never been possible again! PS4 will it seems always be seperate from PS1, PS2 & PS3 and you have to wait to deign to see if they release some classic again or not, eg if you want Sonic 3 you can't, it's available for Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection on PS3 but on the similar release that's just come out for PS4 it & Sonic & Knuckles is omitted . A 4K system from the start would have been a great jump, 4K & HDR gaming compatibility, a 4K Blu-Ray player with HDR, and a brand name would have been PS4K, that would have been a powerful brand. Instead we have had the more wishy washy PS4 Pro tacked on addition to play current games in better resolution and in more detail, not offering a 4K Blu-Ray player as that system and the mounting evidence that the all 4K gaming systems are going to supposedly be at the time of the release of the PS5, missing the opportunity to use a brand name like PS4K.

Credit: achinthamb/Shutterstock As stated in a rumor report from Kotaku, five separate sources (a mixture of first and secondhand reports) familiar with Google's operations have outlined the gist of the company's gaming plans, which consist of producing some form of gaming hardware, spearheading a new streaming platform, and recruiting developers. Though details are extremely light, what's there is telling: the streaming platform will handle heavy-duty computational processes such as rendering graphics, meaning games can be offloaded to Google's servers and streamed, sparing consumers the need for powerful hardware. This makes sense, given the reports' claim that Google's hardware would be linked in some way to the streaming platform. Google might very well be looking to launch a console that doesn't have to compete with the price points of Microsoft's, Sony's and Nintendo's offerings, but in order to sell said console cheaply it would also have to be cheap to produce. The easiest way to reduce costs would be sacrificing expensive physical hardware (high-end GPUs and CPUs) in favor of relying on the aforementioned streaming service, which might be what Google's plans are. As for acquiring developers, word on that front is all but nonexistent. But don't be surprised if Google commits some big bucks to major acquisitions, should these rumors turn out to be true. After all, we just saw Microsoft buy a good number of big-name studios, including Ninja Theory. Google's not one to enter battles unprepared, so we should assume they'll be trying to match, if not exceed, those sorts of studio gains. After all, exclusive IPs and properties are what set apart gaming's current giants. While all of these rumors sound neat, gamers should be cautious when getting excited about the idea of a streaming-centric gaming model. Services like Onlive have proven that consumer-grade internet might not be ready for such a task, and even more recent, improved game streaming offerings like PSNow have proven divisive. We'll see, though — if there's any company with the resources to overcome these sorts of infrastructure hurdles, it's Google. source",,Ricardo,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,,,,

This means the company will focus on software as the primary selling point of the hardware rather than explaining other entertainment functionality in an attempt to appeal to mass audiences. The unveiling of the Xbox One X showed that Phil Spencer has firmly steered the course of Microsoft's gaming division following a period of mixed messaging under prior leadership. As the announcement of Scarlett at E3 suggested, Microsoft is using the message Sony delivered so elegantly with the PlayStation 4 reveal in 2013 by firmly targeting gamers and relying on them to spread the word to achieve laudable hardware sales. Scarlett looks set to beat the PlayStation 5 to market With industry experts predicting the next Xbox will arrive as early as 2020, and after the head of Sony's PlayStation division, John Kodera, admitting last month the next Playstation is still at least three years away, the next Xbox looks set to begin the next generation. Microsoft coming out of the gates first could provide it with an incredible amount of momentum if, for an entire year, all titles look and perform better on the next Xbox. This, combined with the fact the Xbox One X already packs a ton more power than the PlayStation 4 Pro could be incredibly damaging to Sony. The next Xbox will be a graphical behemoth During the announcement of the next Xbox Phil Spencer confirmed Microsoft was working to once again ""set the benchmark for console gaming"". Such aggressive language from the Xbox boss surely means the Redmond-based company is looking to beat Sony on graphical horsepower, just like it did with Xbox One X. If the console harnesses the latest graphical hardware it means games will surely run at a buttery smooth 60 frames-per-second at a full 4K resolution. Backwards compatibility returns and could force Sony to do the same An area where Microsoft has completely dominated the console space is in the area of backwards compatibility. The company added the feature to the Xbox One in 2015 and has made it easier than ever for users to access a huge back catalogue of last generation titles through its subscription service dubbed Xbox Game Pass. Sony meanwhile has struggled to gain traction with its PlayStation Now subscription service and will surely be forced to ensure its next hardware is able to handle all previous PlayStation 4 titles. Microsoft is serious about delivering top-tier exclusives Microsoft launched an all-out assault on Sony's plethora of top-tier exclusives by announcing it had acquired four new studios and had formed a fifth. All five will be developing titles exclusively for Xbox and will surely take the fight to PlayStation that dominated the current generation with industry-leading software like God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn. I have to agree, Microsoft is indeed firing on all cylinders, including turbo and supercharging. Hard to stop a trillion dollar behemoth. Are you excited for Scarlett? I know I am!",,The_Hedon,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Something that takes much more bandwidth and is only playable with low latency. I do some StarCraft on the PC as well with no problems. I guess my point is that it's probably some configuration setting, a bum USG or just some special configuration that LIVE wants. Regardles, I don't blame you. If that was my situation and I couldn't get it working at least on par with my old hardware, I would do the same.

First of all it's available in less than 10% of the countries they serve due to a lack of data centres, which also increases latency. They launched in the UK and a couple of countries in Western Europe, then just sort of stopped. Secondly the library is significantly smaller than it is in the US, updates are also less frequent and often include fewer games. The US is getting close to 800 games in their library now while Europe only recently broke the 600 figure. And finally the price discrepancy is bullshit. Just five weeks ago the service cost over two and a half times more in Europe than it did in America. The addition of an annual sub years after its partial launch has closed the gap cobsiderably though and we're now paying the same 20-40% (depending on your country) more than the US that we do for new games.",,-Murton-,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I've been a huge fan since the beginning, probably my favorite games and I LOVED the Silent Hill movie!

I liked the 2nd one just not as much. Click to expand... I thought the second movie was an abomination. Can't believe Jon Snow played in that movie lol. He really does know nothing. Silent Hill 3 is the most underrated one in the franchise. People always say SH2 is the best. I can see the arguments there but to me, SH3 was my favorite because it was a direct sequel to SH1. I don't think a lot of people got exposed to the franchise until 2. 1 had a lot of problems and I doubt most players got through that game. I was exposed to it when it came out on PS1 and remembering as a kid that game was very hard for me because my little mind had a hard time understanding resource management for survival. I tried to kill all the enemies which was a mistake. I eventually learned from trial and error though. SH2 was basically everything SH1 was suppose to be and the generational jump to new hardware is what made it happen. Both SH2/SH3 were technical marvels for their times.

Tens of thousands of Fortnite players have been infected by malware that hijacks encrypted Web sessions so it can inject fraudulent ads into every website a user visits, an executive with a game-streaming service said Monday.

Rainway CEO Andrew Sampson said in a blog post that company engineers first detected the mass infections last week when server logs reported hundreds of thousands of errors. The engineers soon discovered that the errors were the result of ads that somehow were injected into user traffic. Rainway uses a technique known as whitelisting that permits customers to connect only to approved URLs. The addresses hosting the fraudulent addresses—hosted on the adtelligent.com and springserve.com domains—along with unauthorized JavaScript that accompanied them made it clear the traffic was generated by malware infecting a large number of game players using the Rainway service. Rainway is a cloud-based service that lets people play PC games remotely, similar to PlayStation Now.

“As the errors kept flowing in, we took a glance at what these users had in common,” Sampson wrote. “They didn’t share any hardware, their ISPs were different, and all of their systems were up to date. However, one thing did stand out—they played Fortnite.”

FireDrakeZ posted... grampamurked posted... GunmaN1905 posted... Still terrible with all that input lag and dozen types of blur. Microsoft is trying to sell gamers features rather than games. Kinda sad. They need to knock it out of the park with exclusives with the next console. Otherwise just give it up. Microsoft just started a gaming studio and bought 4 more studios as announced at E3. They are even opening to adding more. It is just a matter of time before they catch up on exclusives. In the meantime they just keep on adding features on their Xbox One console, while Sony has stopped doing that, relying mostly on their exclusives. 4 or 5 years into the life cycle of their system. Same promises every year. As I said when it comes to exclusives they are taking steps to catch up. However when it comes to features, it is not even close. Features on the Xbox One X console not found on the PS4: 4K HDR Blu Ray Player Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Game Pass - subscription service that allows Xbox gamers to access the latest games and not just old ones like on PSNow EA Access - subscription service that allows access to EA games that is not available on the Sony consoles Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor They are also planning to add k/m and mod support to the Xbox One, features that will allow access to hundreds of strategy games and mods that are normally exclusive to PC. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti consumer practices. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those exclusives eventually via PSNow.

How can you look at the visuals in games such as The Last Of US Part 2, God Of War, Ghosts Of Tsushima and Spider Man and say they aren’t a significant leap over what was possible on PS3? As impressive as late PS3 era games such as Uncharted 3 and The Last Of Us looked at the time, they are noticeably less refined than than modern day and forthcoming PS4 titles. Sony’s output just gets technically better and better every year. I think the fact they are churning out graphics of that calibre on hardware pushing 5 years old should be seen as something of an accomplishment. [/quote] PS4 certainly pushes it even better and is usually now full 1080, except for disappointedly the GTA III, Vice City & San Andreas versions on the store which I hoped would be 1080 to match the PC versions. The jumps from PS1 to PS2, and from PS2 to PS3 just seemed so much more obvious, the PS1 was just a CD reader, then the PS2 was also a DVD player and with much bigger and more expansive games now released on DVD rather than CD as a result, things like Grand Theft Auto III would have been totally impossible on PS1, it was all still SD. Then PS3 comes out and all the graphics go near HD, but 720p and we now get a Blu-Ray player and home multimedia system. PS4's main jump was to improve to full HD with 4K only coming later with the PS4 Pro, we already had a Blu-Ray player, at first it didn't even offer the home multimedia player experience as the ability to play video files only came later, and the PS3 even started with more of the on demand apps as they took a while to come to the PS4 as well. Graphics are even more amazing as a given but the move to PS3 to PS4 was almost more of a moving house sort of feeling, rather than wow that new one does all that now, isn't this current one starting to look a bit pants by comparison can't wait to get it. That was the PS1 to PS2 and PS2 to PS3 sort of feeling, now if you built up a game library on the PS3 you had a load of games some of which were in near HD that they couldn't just let you play again on the PS4 yet could come up with a Playstation Now service to make you pay to play them if it happens to be on the PS4, such as Sonic Generations and Crazy Taxi from the store that would only play on PS3 for example. PS3 to PS4 was more of a, I've got to get those games again new on the new system but can't get all of them sort of situation, I can have IPlayer but All4 is not on it yet, always lose something by moving over to PS4 from PS3 so easier to keep both. So a lot of me when I did get the PS4 after a couple of years was having to pay again to get some of the games again on there as well if I even could in the first place, I'd rather have the complete Playstation in one box, that was only possible whilst the PS3 60 GB model existed that for a time provided the complete box that did all PS1, PS2 & PS3, after they discontinued it it's never been possible again! PS4 will it seems always be seperate from PS1, PS2 & PS3 and you have to wait to deign to see if they release some classic again or not, eg if you want Sonic 3 you can't, it's available for Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection on PS3 but on the similar release that's just come out for PS4 it & Sonic & Knuckles is omitted . A 4K system from the start would have been a great jump, 4K & HDR gaming compatibility, a 4K Blu-Ray player with HDR, and a brand name would have been PS4K, that would have been a powerful brand. Instead we have had the more wishy washy PS4 Pro tacked on addition to play current games in better resolution and in more detail, not offering a 4K Blu-Ray player as that system and the mounting evidence that the all 4K gaming systems are going to supposedly be at the time of the release of the PS5, missing the opportunity to use a brand name like PS4K.

Why would i choose to play an old game that probably looks ""worse"" and probably play as well as modern games **that i already played**? that is a really tough sell in my opinion. like i don't ever imagine myself coming into the ps5 wanting to play uncharted 4 or horizon zero dawn or even god of war when i can play HZD 2 or god war 2(or is it 5?) this is why i think remasters like Crash bandicoot insane trilogy or SOTC remake are important. because they offer a more tangible reason to play older games than just nostalgia.",,boomtrick,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Overall, the PS4 has a superior software library and way better exclusives. While PSNow doesn't let you download games like Gamepass does, arguably PSNow has a more robust library. Both consoles give you monthly free games for having a premium membership. Graphically, Xbox One S is inferior to even the PS4 slim due to using DDR3 instead of DDR5. The exclusives on Xbox are kind of crap IMO I've played pretty much all of them. They're not very good IMO. The only ones that are truly great are Forza Horizon 3 and Forza 7, both of which I own. While Forza 7 has more tracks, and better tracks, than GT Sport, it is not nearly as realistic and the handling is kind of cartoonish and lame. Is it fun? Yes. It's very fun. But it's just not as realistic. Is it worth buying an Xbox just for a couple of games you want? That's up to you. I would say no. I would say stick with the PS4. If I'd bought the PS4 before the Xbox I would have never bought the Xbox. If you have a 4K TV do yourself a favor and buy the Xbox One X which is 3+ times as powerful as the S and totally worth the money.",,mistersprinkles1983,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Sony/xbox do not need a subscription for games to come to their console. Devs/publishers have to pay sony/xbox to publish their game on their console. Devs have to pay sony/xbox to patch their game and then increases that fee for consecutive patches in a month. Devs/publishers run and manage game servers not sony/xbox Discord has voice and text chat for free. (I know that was a 360 only thing) Sonys free games a month you do not own and If you stop paying you cant play them. Yes yes I know digital games and DRM are the hot topic these days with no one owning their games. It just bothers me they market it as a feature when in reality it's a way to force users to continue paying. I'm not arguing that people are paying for something they aren't using. I'm arguing that what they are paying for they dont realize they shouldn't have to. Legtiatmely the only reason why paid subscription exists is so Sony and xbox can sell their consoles on a loss and make up for that loss with a subscription. I would 100% be fine with them making up for profit loss with subscription if it actually offered benefits and offers for paying for the subscription. Locking away basic features for a pay wall is not an incentive to pay for it imo. A consumer move would be to offer incentives worth the price of the subscription. They could be like xb1x with their free games a month. They could include the gamepass/psnow with subscription price. They could offer avatars or skins for in game cosmetics for subscription. They could do soooooo many things to actually incentivize people to pay for it.,,kootaroo,United States of America,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Revenue from these subscriptions pay for the computer servers used to run the game, the people that manage and oversee the game on a daily basis, and the introduction of new content into the game. Several MMOs offer an initial trial period that allow players to try the game for a limited amount of time, or until their character reaches an experience level cap, after which they are required to pay to continue to play.**Game subscription services**Subscription services like EA Access and Xbox Game Pass grant subscribers complete access to a large library of games offered digitally with no limitations. User need to download these games to their local computer or console to play. However, users must remain subscribed to play these games; the games are protected by digital rights management that requires an active account to play. New games are typically added to the service, and in some cases, games may leave the service, after which subscribers will be unable to play that title. Such services may offer the ability to purchase these titles to own and allow them to play outside of the subscription service.**Cloud gaming** **/ Gaming on demand**Services like PlayStation Now or Gamefly allow players to play games that are run on remote servers on local devices, eliminating the need for specialized console hardware or powerful personal computers, outside of the necessary bandwidth for Internet connectivity. These otherwise operate similar to game services, in that the library of available may be added or removed to over time, depending on the service.**Microtransactions**Microtransactions represent low-cost purchases, compared to the cost of a full game or a large expansion pack, that provide some form of additional content to the purchaser. The type of content can vary from additional downloadable content; new maps and levels for multiplayer games; new items, weapons, vehicles, clothing, or other gear for the player's character; power-ups and temporary buffs; in-game currency, and elements like loot boxesthat provide a random assortment of items and rewards. Players do not necessarily need to purchase these items with real-world funds to acquire them. However, a game's design and financial approach that aims to provide ongoing service is aimed to assure that a small fraction of players will purchase this content immediately rather than grinding through the game for a long time to obtain it. These select ""whales"" providing sufficient revenue to support further development of new content. This approach is generally how free-to-play games like *Puzzle & Dragons*, *Candy Crush Saga*, and *League of Legends* support their ongoing development, as well as used atop full-priced games like *Grand Theft Auto Online* and *Destiny*.**Games may combine one or more of these forms.** A common example are lifestyle games, which provide rotating daily content, which frequently reward the player with in-game currency to buy new equipment (otherwise purchasable with real-world funds), and extended by updates to the overall game. Examples of such lifestyle games include *Destiny* and many MMORPG like *World of Warcraft*.",,dragonoob44,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The graphics are still upgraded in some aspects but I'm pretty sure it only streams at 720p 30fps. The game looked decent and I also figured it would be a decent way to test out the stability of PSNow with a 3D game since the graphics are pretty good, and everything's been going pretty good so far. Why would the game being 3D matter? You are streaming video, Netflix style. The issue is gameplay lag, which will be present with a 3D or 2D game because you have to receive the video over the internet rather than have it go via HDMI cable. I have zero interest in such streaming services. I'm not interested in adding lag to the gameplay experience.",,Sheepinator,United States of America,,,Positive,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,

Click to expand... SH1 is easily one of my favourite PS1 games ever, but its janky as hell and noticeably tougher than 2 and 3. I'm not just talking combat, there's some puzzle sections that I got stumped on for ages (for anyone that's played it, I'm thinking about the nightmarish hospital bit after Lisa's big scene). As for combat, I just played on Easy and ran past every enemy while out on the streets. Fuck those Pteradactlys. I'd murder a real live human being to get a proper remake of SH1 on PS4 but... a) I don't trust modern day Konami with the franchise and, b) Konami don't give a shit about Silent Hill unless its a panchiko machine.",,Redfield64,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Will they ever release the Silent Hill Collection on PS4?,,,

Eventually, the demo for Yakuza 6 came out and I played it (all the way to chapter 3 since the game was completely unlocked the first day) and I thought 'huh this was actually pretty fun and interesting.' Then, looking at the preorder deal, I could get Yakuza 0 with 6 for 70, essentially getting 0 for only 10 bucks and thought 'ah, why the hell not'. I am now a fairly committed Yakuza fan. 0 is definitely my favorite, but I've played through Kiwami, 6, watched 4 (glad I did cuz weakest in my opinion so far) and played 5 through PSNow, which was painful because it was a streamed game lol.

So normally, assets far away are lower res but improve in quality as you approach, but with the emulation it’s essentially always using the highest quality of everything at the same time. But it’s still limited to the draw distance as it existed on the original system, so cars will still pop in and the number of them and pedestrians, for example, will be exactly the same. What we do get, is better textures, detail, shadows, and then one of the biggest improvements is HDR support (like in Halo 3). If you load that game up and take a screenshot at the immediate beginning of the opening cinematic, you’ll see a gorgeous night sky and stars that are dramatically improved when you toggle SDR/HDR while viewing that screenshot. ————— If it’s an issue of music licensing (particularly in games like GTA with a large library of songs from a variety of artists), then I understand there being additional negotiations that might need to be hashed out. And it’s difficult to contact a company that has dissolved for whatever reason, like Visceral, for example. And perhaps there are compensation issues as well... but for your average game with a regular score and not a licensed soundtrack, and the company still exists in some form or the IP was purchased by another developer or publisher, I would assume this would just be “free money” for them (in the form of any new digital purchases), along with the benefit of polishing up a game from your back catalogue that would potentially excite potential customers of your other titles and/or help drive up pre-orders for the next title they’re looking to release. “Red Dead Redemption” for example, has to be doing wonders for pre-orders for it’s sequel. ————— But for games that are already being sold digitally on the XBOX or PS4, included in GamePass / PSNow / EA Access, etc., and that are already backwards compatible, it just seems like a win that every developer and publisher should be calling up Microsoft to have one of their biggest hits be in the next batch of games specially enhanced for the X. I mean, regular BC games that aren’t enhanced for the X are being upscaled, so I don’t see why X enhancement should be much different. I fully admit that I have no idea what I’m talking about with any authority or experience in the industry and accept that I could be entirely wrong, as I often am and continue to be. But if I were Microsoft, and I’d developed this process (I read about it and can’t remember the name of it, but they named it after the guy that came up with it), I’d be pumping the gas on the greatest hits of the back catalogue, if they’ve really developed a one-size-fits-all emulation for the X that improves the games that much. I hope that there will come a point where it will be a constant flow of newly enhanced XBOX One X titles every week. As someone with a huge backlog of brand new games, X enhancement of old ones is the pretty much the main reason I’d consider going back to replay something I’ve already played. And I’ve bought a decent amount of games digitally that I owned for the OG XBOX (like SSX3, and the recent Rockstar additions). Like I said, that’s easy money that I doubt those titles would have been pulling in otherwise, just off of sentimental suckers like me looking to go back and play a game that now looks as good as I remember it looking.",,And_You_Like_It_Too,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Everyone else either still has their old 360 or already played the games back when they came out. And while playing 360 games with updated graphics is nice, it's not like the PS3/360 were graphical duds, Sony's recompilation of PS2 games is actually more functionally useful as many of those have *not* aged well at all. That said, the biggest value for backwards compatibility is probably for Gamepass/PSNow. Being able to have a large streaming/subscription library (PSNow is working on local downloads) gives the subscription service teeth, and backwards compatibility gives them a lot of old, cheap titles to flesh it out with. So I'm almost certain that they'll have it at some point.

Xbox Scarlett: Five reasons why Sony should be very worried about Microsoft's next console https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/981571/Xbox-Scarlett-Sony-PS5-Microsoft-next-console-release-date-backwards-compatibility The next Xbox will be about gamers first and foremost Unlike the muddled reveal of the Xbox One back in 2013, Scarlett will surely refine Microsoft's strategy of targeting gamers. This means the company will focus on software as the primary selling point of the hardware rather than explaining other entertainment functionality in an attempt to appeal to mass audiences. The unveiling of the Xbox One X showed that Phil Spencer has firmly steered the course of Microsoft's gaming division following a period of mixed messaging under prior leadership. As the announcement of Scarlett at E3 suggested, Microsoft is using the message Sony delivered so elegantly with the PlayStation 4 reveal in 2013 by firmly targeting gamers and relying on them to spread the word to achieve laudable hardware sales. Scarlett looks set to beat the PlayStation 5 to market With industry experts predicting the next Xbox will arrive as early as 2020, and after the head of Sony's PlayStation division, John Kodera, admitting last month the next Playstation is still at least three years away, the next Xbox looks set to begin the next generation. Microsoft coming out of the gates first could provide it with an incredible amount of momentum if, for an entire year, all titles look and perform better on the next Xbox. This, combined with the fact the Xbox One X already packs a ton more power than the PlayStation 4 Pro could be incredibly damaging to Sony. The next Xbox will be a graphical behemoth During the announcement of the next Xbox Phil Spencer confirmed Microsoft was working to once again ""set the benchmark for console gaming"". Such aggressive language from the Xbox boss surely means the Redmond-based company is looking to beat Sony on graphical horsepower, just like it did with Xbox One X. If the console harnesses the latest graphical hardware it means games will surely run at a buttery smooth 60 frames-per-second at a full 4K resolution. Backwards compatibility returns and could force Sony to do the same An area where Microsoft has completely dominated the console space is in the area of backwards compatibility. The company added the feature to the Xbox One in 2015 and has made it easier than ever for users to access a huge back catalogue of last generation titles through its subscription service dubbed Xbox Game Pass. Sony meanwhile has struggled to gain traction with its PlayStation Now subscription service and will surely be forced to ensure its next hardware is able to handle all previous PlayStation 4 titles. Microsoft is serious about delivering top-tier exclusives Microsoft launched an all-out assault on Sony's plethora of top-tier exclusives by announcing it had acquired four new studios and had formed a fifth. All five will be developing titles exclusively for Xbox and will surely take the fight to PlayStation that dominated the current generation with industry-leading software like God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn. I have to agree, Microsoft is indeed firing on all cylinders, including turbo and supercharging. Hard to stop a trillion dollar behemoth. Are you excited for Scarlett? I know I am! Everything else aside, THIS is exactly why i come to the xbox board. If its really gonna be ridiculously powerful and have exclusives that i'll want to play, i have no reason to believe i wont switch back to ms next gen. If Scarlett does deliver on those 2 tenets, the only reason i wouldnt get it would be if it was $600+ and the PS5 implements bc",,ChaosReich,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

How many hours do you need to play, so that the streaming bandwith exceeds the single download size? Let's say you play in 4K, that is a reasonable expectation beyond 2020 and at 30fps, let's not get greedy here. That's 1GB of data / second. Let's say they have a damned efficient compression algorithm. So it compresses it 100:1. It is still 10MB/s. Let's round that up to 40GB / hour! So in 2-3 hours you waste more bandwith than the size of any game available now!

FireDrakeZ posted... grampamurked posted... GunmaN1905 posted... Still terrible with all that input lag and dozen types of blur. Microsoft is trying to sell gamers features rather than games. Kinda sad. They need to knock it out of the park with exclusives with the next console. Otherwise just give it up. Microsoft just started a gaming studio and bought 4 more studios as announced at E3. They are even opening to adding more. It is just a matter of time before they catch up on exclusives. In the meantime they just keep on adding features on their Xbox One console, while Sony has stopped doing that, relying mostly on their exclusives. 4 or 5 years into the life cycle of their system. Same promises every year. As I said when it comes to exclusives they are taking steps to catch up. However when it comes to features, it is not even close. Features on the Xbox One X console not found on the PS4: 4K HDR Blu Ray Player Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Game Pass - subscription service that allows Xbox gamers to access the latest games and not just old ones like on PSNow EA Access - subscription service that allows access to EA games that is not available on the Sony consoles Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor They are also planning to add k/m and mod support to the Xbox One, features that will allow access to hundreds of strategy games and mods that are normally exclusive to PC. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti consumer practices. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those exclusives eventually via PSNow. Gamers dont buy consoles for features, they buy them for games. The X1X is a great console but it lacks the main component to drive sales, EXCLUSIVES. The primary reason the PS2 had high sales is it's included DVD player...gamers buy consoles for features.",,32x2z,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

They rejected EA Access because they felt 'it wasn't good value for their costumers', say what you want about it's value I would've liked to decide that for myself. The real story there is likely that they wanted EA games in the PSNow library. Now they are the only console standing in the way of full cross play, that not only hurts gamers but games was well. Think of games that require matchmaking how much quicker things would be if it had both Microsoft and Sony costumers as a pool to draw form. For struggling games it would also help with it's player count. Personally they are looking at this wrong, I highly doubt those that already on Sony consoles are going to switch brands with next gen only a few years away. The thing they are losing is gamers goodwill. Sony is winning the exclusive game right now, but that will only go so far.",,Mad_Habber,United States of America,,,Positive,Sadness,Reddit,,,,,,,,
