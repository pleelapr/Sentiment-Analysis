The easiest way to fix this is deployment of multiple server farms worldwide, it's always worked great in a lab, heck I use in home streaming with steam and a laptop hooked up to my TV works great, deploying that on commercial infrastructure is a different story though. Further if I look at the connectivity rates in the US which in the majority apparently still runs on xDSL and equivalent technologies and asynchronous rates (Meaning most home connections have a lower upload than download) I don't know if we will see a workable system anytime soon, though companies like Microsoft already having server farms all over the show may be able to mitigate some of the transmission issues, newer companies are probably looking at ridiculous outlays.",,BaronOfBob,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Well, I'm here to tell you that not everyone has a problem with lag. In fact, some people adore it, pray for it, slowly caress their nether regions while thinking about it. Those people are me. I'm a dirty lagger and I'm here to tell you why lag is good. Have you ever played Smash against someone way better than you? Someone who can run circles around your character with one hand while swiping left on Tinder with the other? Someone who can eat a melting ice cream sandwich, catch all the drips with a napkin, and *still* 3-stock you? (Fuck you, Mark.) If so, lag is your new best friend. You see, lag doesn't care about fancy punish combos, short-hop-fast-fall aerials, or how quickly you can give yourself carpal tunnel syndrome by flicking a control stick back and forth. When I queue into a game running slower than a Powerpoint presentation streamed through Playstation Now, I thank our lord and savior Sakurai for the gift and crack my knuckles. Because while everyone else is preparing to play “Super Smash Bros., but slow and laggy,” I’m readying myself a completely different game. You may have heard of it; it’s called chess. I may suck at Smash, but I am a professional player of Smash chess with a rating of over 2300 Falcon kicks. I plan my moves not milliseconds, but minutes in advance. I know exactly where you are going to be long before your up-b out of shield option is a twinkle in your perfect parry’s eye. While you’re buffering your first dash grab, I’ve already planned the next 20 attacks that end with you below the stage without a sliver of hope or a second jump. Check-mate, Melee elitists. To the untrained eye, it may appear as though I stand in the center of the stage mindlessly spamming f-smashes and projectiles. However, I can assure you that the trajectory and timing of every attack has been meticulously calculated to upset your delicate ego and make you reset your game in frustration, which will only result in a 30-minute ban from online play. I am a warrior of the mind as well as a warrior of the controller. Don’t feel too bad; it’s hard to win a game you don’t even know you’re playing. See you on Big Blue.

SXO: People love physical discs, but those same people are the ones who are currently praising the likes of Xbox Games Pass, EA Access and to a lesser extent PlayStation Now, so maybe its a case of being careful what you wish for, because the more people who move the way of Xbox Games Pass and PlayStation Now and away from discs, the faster services such as these will negate the need for them…

I started with 3 then BB, SOTFS and 1 last (hoping to get a demons remaster or play it on psnow). I think it is 1 though since that is what made the series take off and practically created its own genre. It’s funny how many games these days try and market themselves as soulslike, these games might are most revolutionary games of the action rpg genre. I think when people think of Dark souls they think of O&S. That sort of gave Dark Souls it’s tough but fair gameplay and forced people to git gud or ask for help. Demon's Souls requires a specific server environment due to world and player tendency. Don't know if the game will ever be remastered as a result. -- Demon's Souls was the best one.

Sounds like the shipping mistake was a one off. ====================::==================== Another major leak coming out today, and another massive rumored win for AMD: Xbox Scarlett Will Use Zen 2 and AMD Next-Gen GPU Technology; [email protected] FPS Is “On The Agenda” WCCF Tech said: According to a video report from renown Microsoft insider Brad Sams (Executive Editor of Thurrott.com), the Xbox Scarlett console, which will release in 2020, will be using Zen 2 and AMD’s next-generation GPU technology. The aim would be to have games running at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. This would align with earlier rumors on the PlayStation 5 hardware, which pointed to an eight-core Zen CPU and a Navi-based GPU . Once again, both next-gen consoles by Sony and Microsoft could be powered by AMD technology. For the next generation, Microsoft is going to take a varied approach, releasing different types of hardware that will be able to run games through the cloud, like a cheap Xbox console that runs game via the Azure infrastructure , as well as traditional hardware. The company is going to be embracing digital distribution even further, bringing changes to the Windows Store (as promised by Phil Spencer , Executive Vice President of Gaming at Microsoft) and Xbox App and creating a unified system. Backward compatibility is also in the cards, which is not surprising considering how well it’s doing on Xbox One. All of this information has not been confirmed officially, so we have to take it with a grain of salt for the time being. If the console is indeed coming in 2020, we will finally hear more about it sometime next year, possibly at E3 2019; after all, Microsoft already announced the Xbox One X console a year and a half before it actually shipped. Click to expand... Reports are it will lean on the Cloud to gain an advantage over the PS5 which is also slated to run on AMD's Zen2 + Navi hardware : https://www.inverse.com/article/515...how-microsoft-will-use-cloud-to-beat-sony-ps5 Inverse said: Microsoft’s next Xbox console could leverage cloud technology to gain the upper hand over Sony, a report published Wednesday claims. Brad Sams, who previously reported that the upcoming “Scarlett” machine would launch in 2020, claims that the diminishing returns from more powerful hardware will push the two companies to find other ways to differentiate themselves, leading to a new tech race no longer governed by flashy specs and high resolutions. “Hardware differentiator, I think in the next gen, isn’t going to be as big of a deal as the previous gen,” Sams said, explaining how Microsoft and Sony are both likely to offer 4K resolution gaming at a smooth 60 frames per second, but consumers are unlikely to spot the difference with even higher pixel counts or framerates. This will mean offering alternative benefits, like services, price points and cloud technology. In the case of the latter, Microsoft plans to offer Netflix-like game streaming for more casual players and cloud-based processing to enhance high-end games. Microsoft announced its game streaming service in October, Project xCloud , which will leverage its 54 Azure cloud service regions to offer a variety of games without the need for downloads, running over a connection of just 10 megabits per second. The service acts as a competitor to PlayStation Now, which offers access to hundreds of PS4, PS3 and PS2 games for $19.99 per month, and xCloud is expected to start public trials in 2019. Sams previously claimed that Microsoft will offer a streaming-only “Scarlett” box for around $100, saving hundreds of dollars upfront for more casual players that are less concerned about pixel-perfect performance. Click to expand... Tweaktown said: RuthenticCookie on Reddit said that the PS5 is a beast capable of ""4K/60 stable and at the same time kinda monster"" and lines up with what I expect, and what I said in my report on Sony working directly with RTG engineers on the Navi GPU for the PlayStation 5. In my article, I said: ""Sony needs the next-gen PS5 to truly drive 4K 60FPS if it's going to be released in 2020-2022 where 4K will be greatly established at the time. The next generation of consoles need to offer 4K 60FPS at a minimum if they want to keep up with mid-range GPUs in 2020-2027 (given that the PS5 is released in 2020, and lasts for 5-7 years)"". Click to expand... If these consoles indeed drop this early, around Fall/Winter 2020, then part of me wonders if these early leaks may be misleading in representing the next generation of consoles, and if ""backwards compatibility"" should just be ""compatibility"". It's a generational overhaul, from a hardware point of view, jumping from AMD's Bobcat family (the ""Jaguar"" architecture) to their latest Ryzen family (Zen 2), but otherwise there doesn't look like any significant reason for these consoles to be a brand new generation rather than a [email protected] update to the current PS4/XB1 8th generation improving upon the Xbox One Elite & PS4 Pro. If the leak suggestions are correct, and this is a whole new generation of consoles, I can't wait for the same gamers who work so hard to pretend they ""don't care about slight graphical improvements"", like those in this recent thread , to suddenly swoon over "" [email protected] BRO "", and relentlessly hype how amazing these new consoles are on those grounds to justify a purchase since at launch their game libraries will be practically nonexistent for the first year (just as they were with the PS4/XB1 all the way up to 2015).

Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed.

I still stand by my idea though that the configurations will be as I guessed. A premium console that has the hardware onboard including a disc drive will cost he same as any new console launch. The disc less streaming console is to get those really causal players onboard for a cheaper price. They are the ones that will probably not be too fussed by millisecond delays but like the idea of having everything in the cloud. Cheaper console but perhaps more expensive over time because you can’t resell the games ====================::==================== Retro Oswald said: ↑ You don’t think they can release their XBOX Two so to speak as the true successor but also a much cheaper streaming console like Onlive did all those years ago? Click to expand... Given Onlive is no more I'm going to say no. I'd be very surprised to see a disc-less console in X2 or PS5. I just don't think a lot of the user base is after all digital. As for streaming, thats still a while off too IMO. I've not really used the PS4 PlayStation Now to try PS4 games but i'd imagine there some quality sacrifice (as well as response time) to stream that. Thats something i'm not willing to sacrifice TBH for the convenience of streaming. Obviously the abilitiy to download the full game to your device will stop that issue but both need to sort out that digital pricing.",,Cha1ky,United Kingdom,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,The Xbox One General Chat thread | Page 247,,,

I wanna buy an eight generation videogame console, but I can only buy one. If I had the money, I would go for a Switch, but a second hand Switch is still too expensive for me, but I can afford the og xone or ps4. The reason I can't decide is that I have a pretty big backlog of 360 games which are compatible with the xone, and I backed up my saves to the cloud too, but other than that, Gears 5 and Halo Infinite, there's really not much else that's really cought my attention on the Xbox one. Playstation 4 on the other hand has got a great library of exclusives, but it isn't backwards compatible with the ps3 which means I won't be able to play games like Grand Theft Auto IV, Killzone 2, etc. (and no, I am not paying for Playstation Now, that is too expensive for me) Soooo, what should I do?

then i discovered that you can subscribe to Playstation Now and get access to a huge number of games, so i’ll have to decide if i want to do that - right now i have their free trial so i’ve been going through that catalogue and seeing what looks interesting. i’ve always enjoyed playing video games but never did as much as i wanted to!! the console in my house in high school was always in use by my brother, and then when i went to college/moved out i never got my own. so now that i have one i’m catching up for all this lost time, haha!",,emmaswanned,United States of America,,,Positive,Unclassified,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

It's a very different kind of game in a lot of ways and bites off a ton in terms of locations (there are five), playable characters (also five), and things you can do in the game which include things you MUST do. These extra gameplay types are neat ideas but a lot of them are insanely janky. It's a highly polarizing title because of this, depends a lot on what people will put up with. For example, there are two types of taxi missions: one where you have to get someone to their destination but have to do so with insane attention to following the rules. Stopping for pedestrians, stopping at the line for red lights, signaling for turns etc. The other is an Initial-D style balls-to-the-wall race mode. There's even a hunting mode in a remote snowy part of Hokkaido which is like Red Dead Redemption 2 light. You also go to Sapporo which is where I lived for a few years so this entry in the series is special to me as a result. There's a decently-long section in Osaka (same area as all the other games with it) where you play as Haruka, no thugs attacking you. You do, however, do Hatsune Miku-style dance-offs with people, and the storyline for her section is actually a really interesting ""idol manager"" game of sorts. I think a lot of people didn't like it since it was different from the bare-knuckle Yakuza fighting they were expecting, but I loved it. I think overall it has my favorite storyline since while it's all Yakuza-intertwined there's also a TON that's somewhat separate from it (e.g. the Initial-D taxi races has a whole storyline of its own, Haruka's Idol adventure, and also a disgraced baseball player and his hard-knock life story), but you definitely have to put up with a lot of roughness especially if you're used to the PS4 versions of all the games. It's the most polished of the PS3 games but that's really not saying much. If you're not sure it's on Playstation Now, too.",,univbee,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

""but I think we call agree that certain games are more critically, commercially, and socially relevant than others.."" You're also calling for commercially successful as a measurement of relevancy so the service which is commercially more successful will be more relevant according to your own assessment. Critically? Is hard to tell since both have stuff that the other doesn't have, I guess it depends a lot on the games people like but then again PSNow has like 3 times more games than GP so I can see people preferring it specially if they like Sony's first party. Socially, I have no idea what you mean by that but if it has to do with the number of players it attracts again PSNow is currently attracting more people. And if we use your three factors to measure the relevancy of the consoles then basically the PS4 kills then X1 on all three: critically in terms of exclusives both first and third party, commercially and socially since it has like 20 million more active players on its network than the X1.",,Zappat,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I only know what MS is doing because it’s inline with everything else they do, subscriptions to azure, office, ML, etc. Curiously, what has Sony said? I don’t believe that Sony have the infrastructure and labour force that MS does to support such a service. I don’t think that they can effectively scale a world class streaming service to millions of users simultaneously across the world. They certainly are good at supply chain, but cloud services is not their forte. Sony isn’t an internet company, that’s not been their core strength and honestly speaking we haven’t seen them make major moves to in both careers and labour force to be able to compete with MS squarely. They don’t have the data centres and they definitely don’t have the people. Google and MS as businesses are doing their best to land as many data centres as close to people’s homes as possible to reduce latency for real time applications (self driving etc). That just happens to lend well for real time gaming too. There is a reason why Sony hasn’t been part of this particular discussion but Google has been. Anyone thinking that Sony can compete with MS in this space with equivalent margins is folly. MS’ current largest source of revenue is cloud services and they continue to invest heavily into infrastructure to support it. They’ve built the entire company around cloud and I can’t see how a company like Sony will be able to build the capital and labour force to compete properly in this space. I work for a telco, and the biggest fear right now are google, Facebook and MS barreling into the market trying to build capacity closer to the last mile to reduce latency. I’ve not heard a single word of Sony ever come up. Ever. If I do, I’ll let you know. Right now MS gaming is just piggy backing off their other services. I wouldn’t be so quick to carve it up as some brilliant strategy to win the gaming market. If this happens to be the major battleground for next gen, while Sony clearly cannot build the capability to compete, they can partner with a company that has the capability and work the market that way. Google is looking well setup to take on MS in this space. There could also be others Click to expand... MS have an important cloud service. So their infrastructure would be similar to AWS, google, and facebook. Very centralised. From interviews about the PSNow infrastructure, Sony is more like Netflix. Small rack space close to the edge. Very distributed. The theory was that datacenters are better for a cloud services because clients often need massive inter-node bandwidth and large local storage, with backup services, and be able to rent thousands of nodes in the same location.

I like physical games, but I go to mom and pop stores or online if they don’t have the games I want. GameStop pricing is not that great with used games and they barely sell games anymore. Most of the stores now are taken over by toys and other stuff. People are definitely not going to GameStop to buy toys. They want games! Their used games sales have tanked dramatically this year and I hate to say it, but digital only is already here. Many people, including myself still don’t want a digital only future just yet, but look at services like Game Pass. Sony has their PSNow but they really still need to work on it and Nintendo will eventually go full on gaming Netflix like what they are doing with their older games. With game pass, you don’t really have to spend money on individual games anymore. Yes, it’s preferable to buy the game and actually own it, but you don’t really own the games you buy anymore. Every game needs a day one patch and in many cases it’s needed just to even play the games. What’s going to happen when servers shut down? The disc is more or less a license key. So, GameStop will first close down a ton of stores throughout 2019 until they have no other choice but to shutdown. To be frank, shutting down stores individually is a waste of time and money at this point for them. They should just do a full on company shut down. People don’t care enough about shopping at GameStop anymore and their time has come. The writing is on the wall and it’s sad to say, but goodbye GameStop.

For example, there are two types of taxi missions: one where you have to get someone to their destination but have to do so with insane attention to following the rules. Stopping for pedestrians, stopping at the line for red lights, signaling for turns etc. The other is an Initial-D style balls-to-the-wall race mode. There's even a hunting mode in a remote snowy part of Hokkaido which is like Red Dead Redemption 2 light. You also go to Sapporo which is where I lived for a few years so this entry in the series is special to me as a result. There's a decently-long section in Osaka (same area as all the other games with it) where you play as Haruka, no thugs attacking you. You do, however, do Hatsune Miku-style dance-offs with people, and the storyline for her section is actually a really interesting ""idol manager"" game of sorts. I think a lot of people didn't like it since it was different from the bare-knuckle Yakuza fighting they were expecting, but I loved it. I think overall it has my favorite storyline since while it's all Yakuza-intertwined there's also a TON that's somewhat separate from it (e.g. the Initial-D taxi races has a whole storyline of its own, Haruka's Idol adventure, and also a disgraced baseball player and his hard-knock life story), but you definitely have to put up with a lot of roughness especially if you're used to the PS4 versions of all the games. It's the most polished of the PS3 games but that's really not saying much. If you're not sure it's on Playstation Now, too. I'm in the camp that liked 5 a lot. It's odd because the action, like the combat and mini-game variety and and the playable characters/location variety andso on makes it feel like the ultimate build up of the previous 4, but the story is so out there because of a lot of it being pretty distant from the Yakuza itself. The story's are much more personal as a result though and I liked how each person is kind of forced to live like a regular human for a little bit. It was sort of interesting because you get a lot of civilian characters who are respectable in their own way instead of just being noble victims of Yakuza machinations. Like that part in the extreme north section of Hokkaido, those folks are badass, straight up, without having to engage in the typical antics you'd get from the series' yakuza characters. But you see that sort of awakened in them as each of the playable characters enters their space, both for worse and for better. And Haruka's portion (which I loved too) really drives that home). But then the actual yakuza part of the story is as others have said pretty stupid, but I loved everything about it that wasn't directly related to that. To the point where (I know I make this post often) I think the teams' writing and the games themselves could support an entire game with no combat or high level crime lord conspiracies at all, and 5 might have been better if it went that route. Like imagine a game with Dead Souls' karaoke and each other games' best take on the various mini-games, that could be it's own weird slice of life party game thing and still be good. I love 5 just the same though. The combat is GREAT too, I think you could definitely make a case for it having the best combat on the old engines.

It also keeps people from buying or playing an Xbox as opposed to a Playstation or Switch. Like there is minimal complaint for Spider-man and God of War being exclusive but when an Xbox game does it people get mad or talk about it being a bad thing. I'm sure there are people out there who want to play God of War or The Last of Us 2 but don't want to pay for a separate console. Hell, I'm still frustrated that I can't complete the MGS franchise since 4 was exclusive to the PS3. For sure but people just accept and praise Sony for it. I mean, it hurts consumers but its what keep people in the sony ecosystem. Exclusives are just the nature of the beast. I think Microsoft is doing it best by at least putting games on PC. In the near future I do think platform will be pretty irrelevant as everyone will be streaming games but the platform you use, (ala Gamepass, Playstation Now, whatever is out) will again be ruled by exclusives. That's why Xbox is getting all these devs now. In 2029 they want you to be signed up with them to stream games over whoever.

In terms of PlayStation Now, I tried it for three months and I enjoyed it. I got to play the Infamous games (which I love), the Ratchet and Clank games and some Arkham games as well. I don’t play often though and I think buying a year subscription would be a waste of money for me. If you only see a few games you are interested in playing, try the trial or purchase a month and see how it works for you. As for the PlayStation itself, I love it. Again, I’m not a massive gamer but I’ve liked this console more than my PS3 or Xbox consoles. I just recently got into VR and besides for the move controllers, it’s pretty awesome. I even bought a brand new PC that can handle almost anything recently and still find I’m going back to the PS4 more times than not. My suggestion is if you aren’t sold on it, don’t go for it. If you are sold on it but times are tight in terms of money, wait til you can afford it. I promise, you aren’t missing out on something that won’t be around in the future so there’s no rush.

Streaming isn’t renting, it’s streaming. Sony begrudgingly has one crossplay game presently so that point is moot. And if it wasn’t for MS, you’d still be buying memory cards on your consoles like you have to do on the Vita handheld. Please advise what features sony has innovated on the ps4 which MS copied. You claim sony has more, right? You bring up two which I easily discredited. You're renting the games to stream, just like Netflix is a renting service, once you stop paying you lose access to the games, the same with Gamepass. You trying to play semantics won't change that fact. And Sony did it first with PSNow. Saying that Sony would be still using memory cards if it weren't for MS is like saying the Xbox would still be using cartridges if it wasn't for the PS1 which introduced CD. It's stupid nonsense, the fact is that the industry was already starting to move forward away from memory cards due to games becoming more demanding. The PS2 introduced official support for external hdd before the Xbox even released BTW. Sony had crossplay with PC in games like FFXIV (which MS still doesn't allow), Portal 2, Dust 514, Eve Online and many more with Vita. They even had crossplay on PS2 games with PC way before MS had any. You didn't easily discredited anything. You damage controlled them out of pure ignorance real or pretended.",,Zappat,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Fifty Games Added To PlayStation Now Including For Honor
TheSixthAxis
Sony have whacked a sackful of games on their streaming service, PlayStation Now, just in time for the Christmas break. Heading up the list is Ubisoft’s For Honor, and the we have… some other games. To be honest I haven’t head of 90% of these titles …

GTA V had a late release for PC and has proved to make quite a bit of money for them. In addition to monetary boost, another key aspect is that due to many factors, the PC gaming scene has seen a huge resurgence the past few years. RDR1 probably isn't worth the effort to port to PC but can be played on PC via PSNow subscription. That said, it's quite obvious due to the hardware requirements and sheet size of the game why it's not coming to switch. Would it be great if they did? Sure. But at some point you have to ask yourself if it's really worthwhile for both the consumer and producer to undertake this large task and in the end, it seems it didn't add up which is fine. 2019 seems like a big year for switch. I'm a future switch owner (Christmas!) And mainly PC gamer",,blitzinger,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Well, I'm here to tell you that not everyone has a problem with lag. In fact, some people adore it, pray for it, slowly caress their nether regions while thinking about it. Those people are me. I'm a dirty lagger and I'm here to tell you why lag is good. Have you ever played Smash against someone way better than you? Someone who can run circles around your character with one hand while swiping left on Tinder with the other? Someone who can eat a melting ice cream sandwich, catch all the drips with a napkin, and *still* 3-stock you? (Fuck you, Mark.) If so, lag is your new best friend. You see, lag doesn't care about fancy punish combos, short-hop-fast-fall aerials, or how quickly you can give yourself carpal tunnel syndrome by flicking a control stick back and forth. When I queue into a game running slower than a Powerpoint presentation streamed through Playstation Now, I thank our lord and savior Sakurai for the gift and crack my knuckles. Because while everyone else is preparing to play “Super Smash Bros., but slow and laggy,” I’m readying myself a completely different game. You may have heard of it; it’s called chess. I may suck at Smash, but I am a professional player of Smash chess with a rating of over 2300 Falcon kicks. I plan my moves not milliseconds, but minutes in advance. I know exactly where you are going to be long before your up-b out of shield option is a twinkle in your perfect parry’s eye. While you’re buffering your first dash grab, I’ve already planned the next 20 attacks that end with you below the stage without a sliver of hope or a second jump. Check-mate, Melee elitists. To the untrained eye, it may appear as though I stand in the center of the stage mindlessly spamming f-smashes and projectiles. However, I can assure you that the trajectory and timing of every attack has been meticulously calculated to upset your delicate ego and make you reset your game in frustration, which will only result in a 30-minute ban from online play. I am a warrior of the mind as well as a warrior of the controller. Don’t feel too bad; it’s hard to win a game you don’t even know you’re playing. See you on Big Blue.

Most unitys get Sold today at consoles deal with it. Without console players BF and cod wouldn't sell that much. We atleast pay for our Games and don't download them illegal. Playing on PC doesn't make you Elite Player or Expert. I am playing BF since day one and own a PC too. But PC Players are mostly the arrogants fools i ever met.

Project Stream: Everything we know about Google’s game streaming service






Imagine your friend invests in a new GPU to upgrade their already expensive gaming PC so they can play the latest blockbuster video game. Now imagine you open the Chrome browser, and then open a new tab to play the very same video game. While your friends computer kicks into high gear, fans blistering, your computer (perhaps even a Chromebook) stays cool and quiet, because all you’re doing is streaming. 

That’s the idea of Google’s Project Stream cloud gaming service.

Rather than needing high-end hardware, Project Stream allows you to use whatever computer you have around to play video games. Google handles all the heavy lifting on its own servers, which can process the game at high resolutions and frame rates, encode it into a stream, and deliver the stream to you over the internet.

It may sound almost too good to be true, and only time will tell if it is. Right now, the Project Stream service is in Beta. And, while it’s not perfect, it gets the job done, and serves as an impressive showcase of what the future of cloud gaming could look like.

How Project Stream works

It’s not clear how the final product will work, whether Google will maintain the Project Stream name, or even whether Google will continue the project after this beta. But, for the moment, as long as you’re connected to the internet with a fast and stable connection and you’re using a recent desktop version of the Chrome browser, you’ve got the setup needed to use Project Stream. 

Playing a video game on Project Stream is as simple as opening a new tab in Chrome and going to the Projectstream.google.com page.  

Google will prompt you to run a connection test that checks your internet bandwidth, the latency between your computer and the servers, and any data loss. Google requires a streaming rate of 15Mbps, latency below 40ms, and data loss below 5%. With these requirements met, you’ll be ready to dive into a game.

The beta of Project Stream is offering Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, which is nothing short of a demanding title. When you launch the game in your Chrome tab, it will go fullscreen, and run exactly as if it has been launched on a proper gaming computer (except without a deep graphics settings menu). You can play with a keyboard and mouse or connect a game controller and play that way.



All of your inputs on the computer get sent over to Google’s servers, processed in the game, and everything happening gets streamed right back to you. This is why that latency is so important, because you can’t have a good game experience if everything you do in the game shows up a second later.

The limits of Project Stream haven’t been detailed, but Google has shown off the service running at 1080p and 60fps, pretty much the bar for quality PC gaming. 

All of your inputs on the computer get sent over to Google’s servers, processed in the game, and everything happening gets streamed right back to you.

So, in effect, you’re opening a new tab that pipes all your inputs to a high-end gaming PC that streams back the visuals and audio to your computer screen. This system is simpler than some others, which set you up with a virtual desktop that then remotely runs Steam, Origin, Battle.net, or what have you.

In the case of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on Project Stream, you are still required to log into a Ubisoft account to play, but beta testers aren’t required to own the game.

It’s unclear at this point whether Google will require players to buy games and pay for the streaming service in separate transactions, or whether access to select games will be bundled into the service.

What games will be available on Project Stream?

Through the Project Stream beta, the only available game is Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. While this doesn’t give us much idea of what games Google will offer in the future, it does give us a good idea of what games Google could be capable of offering. 

For a 1080p 30fps game experience at High settings in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Ubisoft recommends a system with the following specs:

 * OS: Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only) 
 * Processor: AMD FX-8350 @ 4.0 GHz, Ryzen 5 – 1400, Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.5 GHz 
 * Video: AMD Radeon R9 290 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 (4GB VRAM or more with Shader Model 5.0) or better 
 * Memory: 8GB RAM 
 * Video Preset: High 
 * Storage: 46GB available hard drive space 
 * DirectX: DirectX June 2010 Redistributable 
 * Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card with latest drivers 
For 4K at 30fps and high settings, the recommended specs bump up to include 16GB of RAM, a more powerful AMD Ryzen 1700X or Intel Core i7 7700 processor, and a beefier AMD Vega 64 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. With Project Stream shooting for 1080p at 60fps, the type of system it’s offering would fall somewhere between Ubisoft’s recommended specs.

The truth is a computer that can handle Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 1080p 60fps is going to be capable of playing a whole lot of games at these settings. Other major titles could easily see support on the service.

Games with a major online focus may have dicier prospects on Project Stream. Since competitive online games are often fast-paced and require split-second reaction times, the extra latency introduced by streaming will likely be an issue for serious competitors. That said, we don’t see these games being unplayable on the service.



What’s Project Stream like to use?

At its best, Project Stream is good. At its worst, well, Google won’t let you play below a certain threshold of quality, and you wouldn’t want to anyway.

We tested Project Stream on varying setups. We played on an unstable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection, a fast and nearby 5GHz Wi-Fi connection, and on an ethernet connection held steady and offered high bandwidth. 

The highly dated Chromebook hardware didn’t hold it back from playing.

We also played on a 5-year-old Chromebook, a 2-year-old Razer Blade, and a modern desktop gaming rig that would be happy to run Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 1080p/60FPS on its own hardware. We even started one computer up while another was running the stream, and Google simply transferred control over to the second computer, with no stop in the stream.

Across the board, we’d describe the experience as at least playable. The highly dated Chromebook hardware didn’t hold it back from playing. The biggest issues come from a bad connection: if the connection speed drops, so does the game quality, with lower resolutions, latency, and far more noticeable compression. 

That said, in our experience, the visual degradation came before the latency, so we were able to continue battling enemies smoothly even if they started to look like ghostly swarms of pixels.

Overall, the graphics are fairly good throughout, especially when playing on a high-bandwidth connection using ethernet cables. Colors, shadows, and anti-aliasing look fine, and the frame-rate seems to vary between 30 and 60fps.



The low frame-rate was one of the two issues we noticed. The other was compression. Most of the time, it’s not super jarring, but when there’s a lot of detail in a scene and a lot of movement, the compression turns it all into a bit of slop. Character faces become a blur and hard edges (noticeably the character’s hair) go soft. 

It would seem to be a sign of the lower bitrate enabling this type of streaming, but the truth is that most of the time it’s unnoticeable, and would be even harder to spot if you weren’t looking for it (we were looking for it). Panning the camera and running through dense wooded areas in the game (and combining the two) were the only times we were turned off by the dips in visual quality.

The experience isn’t mind-blowing, at least until you remember that it’s using so little of your computers processing power that you’ve literally got a full-system virus scan going in the background and nothing changed. The visuals are comparable to what you’d get on a console, except with compression artifacts here and there. And, with a stable connection, it compares rather favorably to in-home streaming on a Steam Link.

While the price and service model Google adopts will go a long way in determining whether Project Stream is worthwhile, we can say right now that it works, and it looks good doing it. But, will Microsoft’s xCloud do it better?

My problem has been that basically every game on the service is years old. Games like Bloodborne can be bought for $10 on sale and Im sure alot of the downloadable games are similarly priced on sale. No one is going to play 700 games in a year, hell probably not even 50 so I dont think the size of the catalog really matters. A person will have more than enough to play on psnow or on xbox game pass. I see game pass as a better value because of the games added to that service are much more valuable than the games added on psnow. Mutant year zero got added to game pass and that baiscally saves people money to play on the service as oppose to buying the game. Meanwhile Psnow adds For Honor.

Sony has an analogous service to Gamepass with hundreds of more games to choose from, albeit streamed to your console. I do prefer Gamepass and subscribe to it and not PSnow. But they boast very different benefits: Gamepass boasts game accessibility; while PSnow boasts a giant library to choose from. Also, Sony does support cross-platform with PC for some titles, and was a big proponent of cross-play in the past, only to be snubbed by Microsoft. That being said, to truly be cross-platform, Microsoft needs Sony buy-in and vice-versa, so the day we do see true cross-platform support it will be ubiquitous across platforms by definition. As for mods, I played Fallout 4 with mods on my PS4, so again, just in my own experience, ""leaps and bounds"" is categorically incorrect. I do know that Microsoft is more lenient about what mod content is allowed, so maybe I'd call it ""skips and hops"" above PS4 mod support. I can wholeheartedly agree that the adaptive controller does put Microsoft uniquely leaps and bounds above Sony when it comes to disabled players, albeit for a niche group of gamers. Overall, I'd agree with you that Microsoft services, but you pretty much define my issue with the Xbox this generation: >So far, it looks like they've been focusing on is improving on what it means to be a console It seems Microsoft got to caught up in improving what it means to be a console and forgot the ultimate service a console provides: playing games, and Sony was leaps and bounds above Microsoft when it came to providing that service by providing the best games of the generation on the ps4. I'm surprised you brought up a lot of moot points and forgot backwards compatibility which is probably one of the singular ways Microsoft is in fact leaps and bounds above Sony...",,Disposable_disaster,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Sony has none of this other than PS4. The fundamental fact is, you need data centers in physical locations in other to reduce latency.

I think I’ve enjoyed it more then more recent starwars games (battlefront 2 EA) because they’re more to do, they have mini games, they have more story content, I actually care about the storyline, as I watched the original clone wars series. Battlefront 2 EA is too simple? I guess I could say that. Pick up a blaster, aim and click. It plays like a call of duty game with more health and in space. The LEGO games are made to be simple but they’re not boring. They have puzzles, and so much content. So many characters to choose from. I don’t really care if battlefront 2 is the best looking game out, it is honestly really bare bones and devoid of content. I think there are only like 10 maps or something, and 10 or so heroes on each side. I think there are 52 LEGO starwars 3 missions (I’m probably wrong) and I know there are a shitload of characters. I’m not sure if there was dlc or not, but it feels like a complete game. Battlefront 2, where is mace windu? Where is Jango fett? Ashoka tano, Aayla secura, luminara, asajj ventress, commando droids, captain rex and captain Cody? Where are the Jedi starfighters? Why are there so few maps? Christophsis? Utapau? Dantooine? Battlefront 2 feels devoid of content, and I would rather have more content then the best looking game. I would rather pay for DLC that’s completely full of content, like take up my whole console space, then get 2 heroes and a map for free in a year. I’m glad I didn’t pay the $60 asking price for battlefront 2, but if my ps3 had worked, I would have probably more then gladly paid the asking price for LEGO starwars 3.",,throwawayplease2018,United States of America,,,Positive,Joy,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Just waves of enemies and boss battles with stupid mechanics to them. ugh. no. I also tried Uncharted 1 and 3. It's a bit like Tomb Raider. I'm a bit on the fence with those. I figured it was enough to play them on PSNow. I had gotten the games I have on sale (1 or 2 of them on sale) and at an additional discount because of the ps4 purchase. So I got them at a good price. So, God of War 1-3? COMPLETELY different from God of War 2018. You play new god of war like the old games and you’ll be dead so fast it’s almost comical.

1aeea7bf-8dec-4711-8b70-6d6a444244da,12/3/2018,https://www.maxconsole.com/threads/are-we-heading-towards-an-entirely-digital-gaming-market.50100/,"Little is known about the next generation of gaming consoles at this point, with Sony and Microsoft notorious for keeping their cards close to their chests. ​ Both the Xbox and PlayStation are due upgrades, however, and the technology giants could be looking to release new models as soon as 2019. One of the most exciting pieces of news is the fact that Microsoft may be working on a disc-less console, which could bring about major changes in the gaming market. ​ Recent reports from Thurrott suggest that Microsoft is planning to move away from discs for its consoles to lower the price point of the hardware and make it more affordable. Players who have a large collection of discs will be able to exchange them for the digital download version of the game and play them on the new console. This represents a massive step forward in the evolution of gaming, and discs could become outdated in the next few years. According to Statista , digital sales overtook physical all the way back in 2013. And last year, a whopping 79 percent of video game sales in the US were downloads. Some sectors of the entertainment industry have already moved towards fully integrated online platforms that don’t require software. In the iGaming sector, sites have become hubs for countless games that players can access instantly without having to download. At Sloty.com , for instance, there are hundreds of popular slot games such as Starburst and Game of Thrones, which can be accessed in a matter of seconds. However, with graphically complex and resource-intensive console offerings, it may not be possible to have instant play options like this. There are some services like PlayStation Now and Xbox Game Pass that allow users to stream games through the cloud, but actually doing this through the user's console would be a leap forward. The introduction of 5G internet will speed everything up, and could make previously inconceivable things a reality. The idea behind a move towards disc-less entertainment has been made possible by Netflix, which has changed the game and made physical discs almost superfluous. The streaming service has reduced the number of people buying movies and box sets, and instead allowed them to have access to a whole library of series and films within the Netflix application. In ten years, the company founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in 1997 has gone from having seven million subscribers in the US, to 90 million people worldwide. It has led to other competing services including Amazon Prime and HBO NOW, and a lot of filmmakers are now gearing their content towards these platforms. Many people are now wondering whether the console industry will go in the same direction as services like Netflix. It isn’t out of the question to think that physical discs could be obsolete in the near future, with downloads being the only source of obtaining new games. This could increase sales, as there would be less sharing of games between friends.",,GaryOPA,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Are We Heading Towards an Entirely Digital Gaming Market?,,,

Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed.

It took them what, 3 years to get extra storage added? A feature the X1 has on launch day. When you think about it, the ps3 is an Xbox and the ps4 is an Xbox 360 - when you add up the launch systems respectively in terms of features. Sony started with a renting service first, MS copied that. Sony had crossplay since last gen, MS copied that. Sony had BC last gen for two generations, it seems now MS copied that although Sony went back. Sony started with VR, MS hasn't copied that. Sony started with not charging online for free games, MS hasn't copied that. What exactly has MS done this gen that Sony copied? Certainly not the lack of games lol. Ok Sony did copy the installing games on PS4 through PSNow which they didn't have before. But MS has copied Sony even more.",,Zappat,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Not sure why you think I'm the one that's ""triggered"" when you told me to fuck off for answering your question. So if you want a watercooled system but you want to play PS4 exclusives then you want a watercooled PS4, plus you get the same benefits watercooling a PS4 as watercooling anything, the system runs quieter and cooler. PS4 fans being loud when they spin up to high RPMs is a pretty common complaint, and a cooler system is a longer lasting system. Also, I would beg to differ on the gains, I would be surprised if a system that stays cooler isn't less likely to drop frames or stutter when things get intense on screen. The reason I said you're taking nonsense is your comments about ""using an htpc to use the console's online services"" and ""being able to stream almost the entire library of either console"" are quite obviously false, all you can access is Playstation Now, which lets you stream select PS4 games, about 200 of the close to 2 thousand games that PS4 owners have access to. Even from my list above only Driveclub, Bloodborne, Until Dawn and The Last of Us (PS3 only) are on there, and it's nothing like actually playing on a PS4 anyway as streaming introduces latency that playing directly doesn't. If you just like to watercool stuff but already have a watercooled gaming PC like OP does then buying and watercooling a PS4 over building a watercooled HTPC makes a lot of sense. It might be more of a challenge but it gets you access to games that a second PC does not.",,Lukeyy19,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Of course they worked on it. But you can’t deny they got a lot of help by Microsoft being busy demolishing themselves during the beginning of this gen. But after they’ve won the race by a large margin, they haven’t really done anything, while Microsoft (and even Nintendo ) has progressed to win over players while Sony rose the wave that was based on luck, skill and their competitors fucking up. For sure they benefited from MS forking up, but it takes skill, preparation, and ability to execute to take advantage of opportunities like this. To paraphrase a well liked Raymond E. Feist character “luck is preparation + opportunity”. Honestly, it feels like the narrative sometimes becomes “Sony has dominated for most of the past 25 years basing mostly on luck and competitors fucking up while whenever their competitors managed to score wins it was based only on their efforts and skills and not on luck and their competitors fucking up”. IMHO, Sony kept doing well while MS played catchup and this worked harder than Sony in relative terms and much harder than they did launching the machine launching two revisions where they improved performance and features in each (Xbox One S has slightly higher clocks than Xbox One too). I do not think Sony has been resting on their laurels: they kept going according to plan (PS4 is not short of amazing first and third party software, they did concede on crossplay, they kept improving PSNow, and they finally moved to fix their massive long database issue that did not allow for PSN User ID changes as embarrassing of a legacy as it was..., and prepped and launched a cost effective strong machine like PS4 Pro and tons of exclusives) and are working on PS5 too.

I feel like every year there are several topics dedicated to ""the end is near for gamestop"". Because the end is near for GameStop. 1) GameStop's business model, while currently successful, is exploitative of consumers, and has thus earned the company a great deal of ill will among its customer base. People only shop with GameStop because of the diversity of titles they stock compared to competing retailers such as Best Buy and Walmart. Once digital distribution becomes the standard for consoles as it is with PC, people won't care about GameStop because they'll be able to find the same games for the same price, or cheaper, through the PlayStation Store. 2) GameStop's business model has not effectively evolved with the times. GameStop realized a decade ago that digital distribution was going to be the future, and rightfully bought Impulse from Stardock. However, how well has GameStop marketed that service? How aggressive have they been in making Impulse (Now called the GameStop App) competitive with Steam, GOG, Origin, and UPlay? GameStop allowed Impulse to languish, and instead invested in side businesses that won't make the kind of margins that GameStop makes from used games. Said investments include a mobile carrier business (which GameStop recently sold for a large influx of cash), and selling toys, t-shirts and collectibles, but the latter has not proven to be a viable alternative revenue stream. 3) Sony and Microsoft have gone from offering digital distribution services such as Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Store as supplemental services to reach an untapped market, to aggressively pushing digital platforms such as Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Now. Microsoft was prepared to make the Xbox One a primarily digital platform, but their botched unveiling stalled that effort. However, with the current rumor that Microsoft's Next Box will come in a SKU that only streams games, and a SKU with no disc drive, it is clear that digital distribution on consoles will inevitably become the new standard, at which point GameStop will no longer have physical media to sell. The fact of the matter is that when a particular business fails, it is rarely immediate, or unexpected. It often takes years of missteps, missed opportunities, and inevitable obsolescence, but it happens. People still buy DVDs and Blu Ray discs, but Blockbuster and Hollywood Video no longer exist, as they were made irrelevant thanks to Netflix. Just like Blockbuster, so too will GameStop vanish, having failed to adapt to changes in consumer behavior. We are witnessing the decline of a giant, so enjoy the show. It won't be long before GameStop becomes the subject of a Company Man video on YouTube. https://youtu.be/5sMXR7rK40U",,TheCaliNerd,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

It's open to the imagination, with people thinking he's playing action games seamlessly. What games is he playing, and what's the latency like? We know there are physical limits regards transfer times, and we know that part of the way to reduce latency is to move servers nearer users rather than route across thousands of miles. We know streaming games works because others have already been doing it for years, and we know it's not ideal but an okay experience, particularly for some genres. Spencer's comment doesn't build on that any - are they lower latency? Or is the experience similarly a compromise? Click to expand... Streaming's come on leaps and bounds over the last few years. I don't know what PSNow's like, and xCloud is still up in the air ( ) but I can happily play Spider-Man via Remote Play, at my friend's house, which is roughly a 20 minute drive. This, on my smartphone, from my WiFi connected PS4Pro. Having the consoles located in server farms will be a further improvement. If they can beef up the server hardware to render at 60 or 120 fps, so dropped frames matter less, that'll further improve it. If the local streaming consoles are capable of frame interpolation and upscaling, that'll further improve it too. I used to be pretty skeptical about game streaming, and I'll always want to play the likes of Spider-Man on local hardware, but the tech's already there to make my sub-optimal situation viable in the suburbs of a fairly minor British city. Little boxes with a mostly stable, barely laggy 30fps will be good enough for most people.

Costs double the price and its talking about money made. even says so in the article. lol well...when you have something of value you usually can get away with charging a little bit for people to gain access to it. Now when you know what you're offering isn't worth shit, then usually you do whatever you can to get people interested even going as far as giving it away for $1 :P Since its talking about revenue that makes it even MORE impressive, because you need to get 20 people to sign up at 1 dollar to make the same amount as 1 month of PSNow. I would assume that there are some people who've tried the service who now will stick with it and pay the 10 bucks a month, there is the potential for gamepass revenue to go up rather quickly next quarter.",,Steppy_76,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

180764671046,12/3/2018,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/180764671046,"PlayStation Network services are currently offline, which means online gaming, shopping, and communication is currently unavailable on the PS4. The PlayStation Network service status page states account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Now; Vue; Video; Store; and Music are all inaccessible. 

“You may have some difficulty launching games, applications, or online features,” a message on the site reads. “Our engineers are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and we thank you for your patience.”

Based on messages directed at the various PlayStation support accounts on Twitter, it looks like the outage is widespread, with users both in the US and Europe reporting issues with connectivity. Sony has not provided a timeframe for when it expects services to be up and running again. The actual cause of the issue has also not been detailed.

With any luck, the problems won’t be severe and the service should be up and running again soon. Of course, outage at this time of the year immediately sparks memories of 2011, when PlayStation Network was severely compromised by hackers. In that situation, services were not restored for a significant length of time.

I don't know what PSNow's like, and xCloud is still up in the air ( ) but I can happily play Spider-Man via Remote Play, at my friend's house, which is roughly a 20 minute drive . Click to expand... Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed. You can just build one epic installation in some cheap country and serve the whole world from there. ====================::==================== True, locality does matter. I think it's worth reading that part of the Quote: again. Phil Spencer said: Spencer concluded by talking about the issue of latency while streaming games. He mentioned that he’s already streaming games while he’s on the road around the world, and the test servers for Project xCloud are still in Washington, but Azure has a global scale. Click to expand... The last sentence just merges together a couple of details that deserve more time: - ""already streaming games while he’s on the road around the world, and the test servers for Project xCloud are still in Washington"" says virtually nothing, because we've no idea what the quality's like and, as you said, no idea the kinds of games he's playing or the limitations of the tech. - ""but Azure has a global scale"" is the bit I'm focusing on. Anywhere that has Azure servers will get some quantity of xCloud servers and my understanding is that Azure's quite widespread. So, I think it's poor reporting, not a poor response. All of this game streaming malarkey makes me curious if the pyramids are actually for streaming Assassins Creed Origins across every corner of the universe, but the Sphinx is missing her aerial.

I enjoy building my own PC, however, I am learning web development and I find the need for portability (it is easier for me to focus in places Starbuck/Barnes and Noble where I don't have distractions). I've done one of those coding boot-camps and used a surface book and when doing larger files the surface book started having difficulty keeping up. Because of this I have been looking more and more at gaming laptops because of their performance and foregoing a custom PC build. I would honestly still prefer a custom build and using a cheap laptop or Chromebook. My question is this; is it possible for me to build a PC and buy a cheap laptop that can access my PC's performance remotely? I know cloud computing (such as PlayStation Now and Liquid Sky) lets you play games on a remote server similar to Netflix. Also, Microsoft has a built in remote desktop feature in Windows but I don't know how the performance is (I am trying to avoid a lag).

But as somebody sitting back and taking a longer-term view of where our business is going, you should look at that as a business model that we think scales to billions of people not hundreds of millions of people like retail does."" ... However, the most interesting implication is that Microsoft might seek to bring its Game Pass service to PlayStation and Nintendo devices.

Not sure why you don’t think Sony would do it when they were the “first” to do it in 2014 lol (They allowed you to access PlayStation games outside of ps4...TVs and handhelds and blu ray players and media players) Sony was the first to allow legacy Sony games accessible on the pc in 2016 (Microsoft was already planning it and did so later in 2016) Now Xbox is allowing Gamepass access on Pc (with xboxone games included)...why wouldn’t Sony be planning something similar? Once Gamepass became a thing, Sony moved to allow their PsNow games to start being downloadable (rather than just streamed)...no doubt to give a better gaming experience for PsNow Oddly enough, once Microsoft announced their big plans for streaming and Gamepass access across multiple devices, Sony pulled PsNow support from ps3/vita/roku/playstation tv/blue ray players and all TVs except Bravia last year. The reason given was that they wanted to focus on windows PC...so they could “develop and improve” their PsNow service. They are absolutely re working and planning on expanding their gaming service outside of PlayStations to compete/coincide with Microsoft services on other devices. They would be foolish not to untie their service from PlayStation hardware going forward. ...and beyond that who knows what will happen. We might all be playing a Google console in 10 years lol.

Don’t put too much stock in mass market dedicated consoles...even if it’s google If people in 10 years can get access to AAA multiplats on any of the devices they own, they aren’t going to pay $200-$500 for a console anymore.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Why wouldn't they be?

Sony has none of this other than PS4. The fundamental fact is, you need data centers in physical locations in other to reduce latency. Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing aggressively in this field and Sony hasn't anything. If you want to know why PSNow has a very small availability, lack of global data centers is why.

First of all streaming has lag and collisions, the technology isn't coming to fix this to a level where the embedded device will become ""useless"". Secondly the platform itself is standardized and in a controlled environment. This is the primary benefit of an embedded system along with proprietary technologies shared by first party developers. This is why the PC gaming platform just doesn't quite measure up even though the hardware is leaps and bounds ahead. The ""streaming PC"" is a not a fix here either because no matter how much control the service provider wants, the streaming client is still at the mercy of the platform it is running on. Finally (but there is much more in the weeds), the customer isn't going to want the streaming service. A pay to play service coupled with a subpar experience will never replace an embedded device for a purpose that stands alone without requiring a fee. Trust me, I have written 3 different letters to Sony about PSNow after several alpha rollouts I participated in. It is a poor technology choice and the first company to push for it by itself instead of an embedded device is going to go bankrupt.",,jeremy_w24,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,M,,,,,,,

For ""half the price"" you are limited to playing just on Xbox and have to pay for another subscription (which increases the price). The reason why PSNow has more last gen games than GamePass is because it has been out much longer and they have put more games on it, backwards compatibility has nothing to do with these services and no one said PSNow is a better service because it lets you play old games...

And I've never had an Xbox console but looking at their lineup of games, it's pretty solid. And you can play some of them natively on PC as well, which is really cool. You can't really compare a gaming service to a video service though, but there's still more value in Netflix. Way more content on there (for now) than Game Pass and PSNow combined. Plus if you have family/close friends you can share an account and split the costs.

Well, I'm here to tell you that not everyone has a problem with lag. In fact, some people adore it, pray for it, slowly caress their nether regions while thinking about it. Those people are me. I'm a dirty lagger and I'm here to tell you why lag is good. Have you ever played Smash against someone way better than you? Someone who can run circles around your character with one hand while swiping left on Tinder with the other? Someone who can eat a melting ice cream sandwich, catch all the drips with a napkin, and *still* 3-stock you? (Fuck you, Mark.) If so, lag is your new best friend. You see, lag doesn't care about fancy punish combos, short-hop-fast-fall aerials, or how quickly you can give yourself carpal tunnel syndrome by flicking a control stick back and forth. When I queue into a game running slower than a Powerpoint presentation streamed through Playstation Now, I thank our lord and savior Sakurai for the gift and crack my knuckles. Because while everyone else is preparing to play “Super Smash Bros., but slow and laggy,” I’m readying myself a completely different game. You may have heard of it; it’s called chess. I may suck at Smash, but I am a professional player of Smash chess with a rating of over 2300 Falcon kicks. I plan my moves not milliseconds, but minutes in advance. I know exactly where you are going to be long before your up-b out of shield option is a twinkle in your perfect parry’s eye. While you’re buffering your first dash grab, I’ve already planned the next 20 attacks that end with you below the stage without a sliver of hope or a second jump. Check-mate, Melee elitists. To the untrained eye, it may appear as though I stand in the center of the stage mindlessly spamming f-smashes and projectiles. However, I can assure you that the trajectory and timing of every attack has been meticulously calculated to upset your delicate ego and make you reset your game in frustration, which will only result in a 30-minute ban from online play. I am a warrior of the mind as well as a warrior of the controller. Don’t feel too bad; it’s hard to win a game you don’t even know you’re playing. See you on Big Blue.

Not sure why you don’t think Sony would do it when they were the “first” to do it in 2014 lol (They allowed you to access PlayStation games outside of ps4...TVs and handhelds and blu ray players and media players) Sony was the first to allow legacy Sony games accessible on the pc in 2016 (Microsoft was already planning it and did so later in 2016) Now Xbox is allowing Gamepass access on Pc (with xboxone games included)...why wouldn’t Sony be planning something similar? Once Gamepass became a thing, Sony moved to allow their PsNow games to start being downloadable (rather than just streamed)...no doubt to give a better gaming experience for PsNow Oddly enough, once Microsoft announced their big plans for streaming and Gamepass access across multiple devices, Sony pulled PsNow support from ps3/vita/roku/playstation tv/blue ray players and all TVs except Bravia last year. The reason given was that they wanted to focus on windows PC...so they could “develop and improve” their PsNow service. They are absolutely re working and planning on expanding their gaming service outside of PlayStations to compete/coincide with Microsoft services on other devices. They would be foolish not to untie their service from PlayStation hardware going forward. ...and beyond that who knows what will happen. We might all be playing a Google console in 10 years lol. Click to expand... lol, the driving force for dedicated gaming hardware is still casuals right now. Don’t put too much stock in mass market dedicated consoles...even if it’s google If people in 10 years can get access to AAA multiplats on any of the devices they own, they aren’t going to pay $200-$500 for a console anymore.

Expect to have 30 minute load times per level if you did that. They already do something similar to that: Playstation Now, which has the game running ""in the cloud"" and you just are the controller and display. ====================::==================== They do have something like that. However, it is only used for saving game progress, not the actual game. Xbox One and PS4 games are very large, usually 50+ gigabytes in size. Unless you have a very, very fast Internet connection, it would be very difficult to stream a game over the Internet without loosing any quality and maintaining good FPS and not have the game unresponsive. My thought is that it wouldn't work very well for most people.

Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed. You can just build one epic installation in some cheap country and serve the whole world from there. ====================::==================== Tkumpathenurpahl said: ↑ I wonder how similar the server hardware will be to the home console hardware.

Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed.

It's not, it's a subscription service and you download all the games. That's a minor but obviously *major* detail. I think it's the same thing again here. Slipping up on something silly, but just enough that it completely influences the narrative of the story.

Well, I'm here to tell you that not everyone has a problem with lag. In fact, some people adore it, pray for it, slowly caress their nether regions while thinking about it. Those people are me. I'm a dirty lagger and I'm here to tell you why lag is good. Have you ever played Smash against someone way better than you? Someone who can run circles around your character with one hand while swiping left on Tinder with the other? Someone who can eat a melting ice cream sandwich, catch all the drips with a napkin, and *still* 3-stock you? (Fuck you, Mark.) If so, lag is your new best friend. You see, lag doesn't care about fancy punish combos, short-hop-fast-fall aerials, or how quickly you can give yourself carpal tunnel syndrome by flicking a control stick back and forth. When I queue into a game running slower than a Powerpoint presentation streamed through Playstation Now, I thank our lord and savior Sakurai for the gift and crack my knuckles. Because while everyone else is preparing to play “Super Smash Bros., but slow and laggy,” I’m readying myself a completely different game. You may have heard of it; it’s called chess. I may suck at Smash, but I am a professional player of Smash chess with a rating of over 2300 Falcon kicks. I plan my moves not milliseconds, but minutes in advance. I know exactly where you are going to be long before your up-b out of shield option is a twinkle in your perfect parry’s eye. While you’re buffering your first dash grab, I’ve already planned the next 20 attacks that end with you below the stage without a sliver of hope or a second jump. Check-mate, Melee elitists. To the untrained eye, it may appear as though I stand in the center of the stage mindlessly spamming f-smashes and projectiles. However, I can assure you that the trajectory and timing of every attack has been meticulously calculated to upset your delicate ego and make you reset your game in frustration, which will only result in a 30-minute ban from online play. I am a warrior of the mind as well as a warrior of the controller. Don’t feel too bad; it’s hard to win a game you don’t even know you’re playing. See you on Big Blue.

Trying to use Netflix as a basis for successful, profitable game streaming service doesn't work because the audiences aren't even comparable in both size and frequency of use. Then you get into the whole content thing and that's another can of worms entirely. Unless you have a steady stream of consistent content, people will simply use the service sporadically, signing up for the shortest amount of time available and then cancelling once they've finished the game they were interested in. If you think publishers stick their big snouts into game production now by forcing unrealistic timelines and cutting content out to sell later as DLC, just wait until they start up a fledgling streaming service that is starved for content. Truthfully, the only people I've seen truly excited about game streaming services are those whose favored platform isn't doing so well selling games conventionally. I don't think Sony gives a fuck about streaming when they're having no problem getting people to buy shit conventionally or digitally. Streaming may make sense at some point in the future, but it also may very well not -- hinging your platform's success on it would be just as unwise as releasing a $500-$600 machine on the market and hoping for the best. At some point you have to have a PLAN, not just another hail Mary thrown, but a genuine plan, and not just a ""well hell, that didn't work, let's try out this newfangled streaming thing, I hear the kiddos love that."" Sony cheerleader obviously lol.

Watched the video from LTT ([https://youtu.be/0BQ4bXNdEQI](https://youtu.be/0BQ4bXNdEQI)) about the Shadow game streaming service and it got me thinking about what the future is for game development? On the more macro side, Services like Xbox's Game Pass and Playstation Now allow you to pay a fee per month to access a whole library of games, but how do developers get compensated? What values/metrics are the games being judged on? And how can this be sustainable for any business? Where do indie developers fit into all this? As for micro focus, how does this affect decisions we make when developing; Here's an example: in a world where a large portion of your players stream and your game can be played on everything from a TV to a phone to a set-top box on a desk, what do you prioritize: Mouse or keyboard? How do you balance multiplayer to handle these differences? What about building in features to compensate for latency for players with a worse connection; should some players get a boost to their ""stickiness"" when aiming if their ping is low?

Wii Shop Channel, Virtual Console, WiiWare, DSi Shop, eShop, now Switch Online Shop. Personally, I really liked eShop. Short and to the point and it was consistent across all their platforms at the time (3DS, Wii U, Switch). Now here we go again with another name. Click to expand... This. Consistency is something that I feel consumers find security and confidence in. If you have a good experience with something? Your likely to be a repeat customer from that same establishment be it a brick and mortar store or a digita storefront. Name association is incredibly strong and Nintendo continually changing names just to be 'cute' I feel risks muddying the messaging. Click to expand... Nintendo continually calls each hardware system something completely different...seems to be fine with consumers. Creating a new online ecosystem to coincide with a new hardware ecosystem...seems perfectly par for course? I don’t see it being that much more “confusing or muddying” than calling this the Switch compared to Wii U 2 or Wii 3 Wes68 said: ↑ But that's the thing I don't get. I don't see why they have to consistently rebrand an online shop? It's not like branding their hardware. I mean a digital storefront is a digital storefront. Steam, GOG Galaxy, B.net. These are so well known because they have been consistent. And yes I realize these platforms are on PC rather than console where the console is a closed ecosystem. They update from time to time. But the name has largely stayed the same. Click to expand... You are talking about stand alone services...they live and die on their service, so maintaining continuity with the name branding of the service is important. Name branding an app where you go to digitally download Nintendo games on a given piece of hardware...really doesn’t need continuity on its own. Making it unique to brand the piece of Nintendo hardware it’s connected to is more important. Wii shop should be how we think about the Wii. Eshop should be how we think about the 3ds (the Wii U tried to have it both ways...) It’s ok to rebrand an online service if it’s doing something different than what came before it. Notice it’s “gamepass”...not “xboxlive pro”. Notice it’s “PsNow”...not “psn plus*plus”. I would have to assume that the new shop they unveil on the Switch will be different enough in look and services that not calling it “eshop” will make sense. To your point about ""Why roll out a brand new Nintendo Online network with the launch of the Switch with the risk of the Switch bombing?"" Well why roll out a brand new Nintendo Online Network now then? Clearly the Switch is doing well now as it is. It's not like they need to rebrand their online network when the switch is doing well as is. Rather then them rebranding their shop? I'd rather see them actually focusing on some of the issues the eshop has. Now it's possible that maybe they do that in the process of such a rebrand. But I have my doubts about that when it took them as long as it has to get where they are with their online right now. Click to expand... Well Wii shop and eshop were just digital store fronts...that’s it. They weren’t really services. Wii VC and Wii U VC was another type of digital store front tacked on along side it. The online service Nintendo is attempting to roll out now is more of an all encompassing service...similar to what microsoft and Sony have been doing for a decade now. Before now it’s been a hodgepodge of Nintendo Network ID’s, Nintendo accounts, friend codes, Wii numbers, eshop accounts..Nintendo wanted to streamline and unify it since the end of the Wii console. Now they they committed to unifying their hardware under one ecosystem...it makes sense to tie that all together. Nintendo Online was always the plan regardless of Switch success or not...but what Switch success has allowed is for Nintendo to completely overhaul everything under their new Online banner. Again, their approach to their digital store front going forward will probably be way different enough to warrant branding it something else beside “eshop”",,phantomnx,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed.

Only use this account for PsNow. You’ll have to pick an existing address. I suggest a vacant address or something like a random fast-food restaurant or something in the US (lol not sure if this is illegal but what the hell). After making this account you’ll need to buy an American PSN card/code worth 20 dollars. Use this code to add those 20 dollars to your American playstation wallet. With these 20 dollars you can buy one month (I think) of PsNow for that account. Result: Enjoy Yakuza 4 and 5 and all other PSNow games.

I’ve always said from day one that when the end comes for the Trump presidency it will come quick. I’ve also said from day one of the Mueller probe that in the end, the level of criminality and conspiracy Mueller will uncover and be able to prove will be staggering. Most of you make the mistake of assuming that since the Republicans control the Senate, even if the House impeaches him he won’t be removed. You couldn’t be more wrong. Most of them are establishment conservative Republicans who don’t care for Trump in the first place...never have. Anyway, when Mueller finishes his report it goes to the AG who then decides what to do with it. That report is going to be so devestating that he’ll have no choice but to take it to Congress. The report will be shared with the leadership of both parties only. After the shock subsides, the leadership and the AG will go to the WH where it will be shown to Trump and his attorneys. They will make the deal offer then...resign the presidency immediately or face certain impeachment in the House and certain removal by the Senate along with public release of the report BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE TO DO IT. Part of the deal will be no prosecution for Trump or his family along with...and this is BIG...the sealing of the Mueller report for decades to come. Much like we saw with some of the Nixon and JFK material. Mueller’s report will be devestating & embarrasing for the Trump’s & the country. Most of us will be dead by the time it is released.

They seemed to have carved out a nice chunk for themselves with PSNOW and purchased the companies they thought would get them to this point. Most likely in the long term they may be eclipsed by amazon or google or Microsoft or all three but they will still continue to receive revenue just as they are now. They may ultimately not be the leading provider in this category but did they ever want to be? Sony just like Microsoft just like Nintendo have their own plans to generate profits and have their own business model to pursue. So what if they are not number 1 in this category I believe you need to look at all of the so called categories and right now Sony is on top. Will this change in the future?

First of all streaming has lag and collisions, the technology isn't coming to fix this to a level where the embedded device will become ""useless"". Secondly the platform itself is standardized and in a controlled environment. This is the primary benefit of an embedded system along with proprietary technologies shared by first party developers. This is why the PC gaming platform just doesn't quite measure up even though the hardware is leaps and bounds ahead. The ""streaming PC"" is a not a fix here either because no matter how much control the service provider wants, the streaming client is still at the mercy of the platform it is running on. Finally (but there is much more in the weeds), the customer isn't going to want the streaming service. A pay to play service coupled with a subpar experience will never replace an embedded device for a purpose that stands alone without requiring a fee. Trust me, I have written 3 different letters to Sony about PSNow after several alpha rollouts I participated in. It is a poor technology choice and the first company to push for it by itself instead of an embedded device is going to go bankrupt. I see merits for a PS5 the same way I see merits for an Xbox Two. Is the people who keep saying Xbox is irrelevant because of PC, but at the same time love physical games (PC being all digital) and don't consider the fact that the majority of gamers don't own a gaming PC and that PSNow library will continue growing and soon enough all those PS4 exclusives will be on PC. Is just pure hypocrisy. Anyway, I stand by what I said, if PSNow technology improves, it seems a PS5, ok maybe PS6, will be a useless device.",,devnull520,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Well, I'm here to tell you that not everyone has a problem with lag. In fact, some people adore it, pray for it, slowly caress their nether regions while thinking about it. Those people are me. I'm a dirty lagger and I'm here to tell you why lag is good. Have you ever played Smash against someone way better than you? Someone who can run circles around your character with one hand while swiping left on Tinder with the other? Someone who can eat a melting ice cream sandwich, catch all the drips with a napkin, and still 3-stock you? (Fuck you, Mark.) If so, lag is your new best friend. You see, lag doesn't care about fancy punish combos, short-hop-fast-fall aerials, or how quickly you can give yourself carpal tunnel syndrome by flicking a control stick back and forth. When I queue into a game running slower than a Powerpoint presentation streamed through Playstation Now, I thank our lord and savior Sakurai for the gift and crack my knuckles. Because while everyone else is preparing to play “Super Smash Bros., but slow and laggy,” I’m readying myself a completely different game. You may have heard of it; it’s called chess. I may suck at Smash, but I am a professional player of Smash chess with a rating of over 2300 Falcon kicks. I plan my moves not milliseconds, but minutes in advance. I know exactly where you are going to be long before your up-b out of shield option is a twinkle in your perfect parry’s eye. While you’re buffering your first dash grab, I’ve already planned the next 20 attacks that end with you below the stage without a sliver of hope or a second jump. Check-mate, Melee elitists. To the untrained eye, it may appear as though I stand in the center of the stage mindlessly spamming f-smashes and projectiles. However, I can assure you that the trajectory and timing of every attack has been meticulously calculated to upset your delicate ego and make you reset your game in frustration, which will only result in a 30-minute ban from online play. I am a warrior of the mind as well as a warrior of the controller. Don’t feel too bad; it’s hard to win a game you don’t even know you’re playing. See you on Big Blue.

""When you think about reaching a customer with this content where their only compute device could be an Android phone, you think about, 'What are all the ways that person pays for content today'?"" Spencer said. ""So we need to make sure that we're world-class at free-to-play content, but we also look at subscription as a much lower barrier way for a customer to build a library of content. ""So we built Xbox Game Pass -- it started on console, it will come to PC, and eventually it will come to every device -- we use the flywheel that we have with customers on an Xbox to start the growth in Xbox Game Pass. But as somebody sitting back and taking a longer-term view of where our business is going, you should look at that as a business model that we think scales to billions of people not hundreds of millions of people like retail does."" The most obvious way Xbox can bring its Game Pass titles to mobile is through Project xCloud, the streaming service announced earlier this year that goes into public testing in early 2019. The initial video demo showed Forza Horizon 4 running smoothly on a smartphone, and the launch of an Xbox Game Pass app could provide access for mobile users. However, the most interesting implication is that Microsoft might seek to bring its Game Pass service to PlayStation and Nintendo devices. Spencer's comments weren't limited to ""console, then PC, then mobile"" -- he instead said ""every device"". Whether the rival platform holders will allow such a service on their consoles remains to be seen -- it's most unlikely with Sony, given the firm's reluctance to even open its systems up to cross-play for popular multiplayer titles. But Microsoft has been working closely with Nintendo this year, even prpmoting their cross-play functionality in a joint marketing campaign. It's also worth noting Microsoft has already released content on rival consoles in the form of Minecraft (although this is, of course, a property that was already on multiple devices before Microsoft acquired it).

When that happens there shouldn't be needs to subscribe to these services? PS4 Emulation will be easier than PS3, that is for sure. A PS4 is based on a modified AMD APU architecture. So emulating a PS4 is a matter of time (I'm not sure if to run the games one also needs some key to decrypt them so this may be a problem). PS3, despite being much older, is of a different processor architecture that is not easily emulated on x86 hardware. On a side note, there are some PS2 games on PSNow, my favourite is the Tennis and the Golf ones... they are even downloaded... I guess PS2 emulation is top notch now for a PS4.... I wish there were more PS2 games... the ones they have are either obscure or very small releases from Sony studios.

Until Microsoft proves otherwise with their new studio acquisitions, only on Playstation will you receive these single-player only games that aren't littered with microtransactions and multiplayer focused games. Sony would be foolish to deter from this. Yes the big games that every gamer knows and the casual audience knows (Call of Duty, Fifa, NBA2k, Madden, etc) are going to sell big, we know this every year and won't change anytime soon. But when you see God of War and Marve's Spider-Man hit at the top of sales charts and stay there for weeks for games that are only on one console, you know there is a demand for it. Word of mouth gets spread how good these games are and people who may not own the console want to play them. Once they buy that playstation, now they are in the ecosystem, thus checking out other software that is only on playstation. Then they buy Playstation Plus to play with friends online and check out the free games offered, and maybe they want to try out Playstation Vue or Playstation Now. ​ That's how Sony is making money. Let the Single Player experiences thrive and get consumers to buy the only console that can play these games. Once that is done, then and only then will you start making money that can rival the big games that come out every year.",,Thebovinejoni,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I'm not that interested, despite my PlayStation biting the dust way back when. At least the PS2 still works and plays PS1 games, so I got that going for me. Same with my PS3, which I discovered not that long ago, but it doesn't play PS2 games because my version of the PS3 is the later 'slim' version. I don't know why Sony did away with the backwards compatibility like that, not that it matters now since my brother hasn't asked for the PS2 back (he thinks its broken). The PS4 is not backwards compatible with anything, but I know you can purchase old games if you have a PSNow account, which I don't. I have a few VC PSOne games on my PS3, and a couple on my PS4, despite owning a couple of the physical versions. I don't know why I do that, buy the VC games despite owning them already. Some of them, like the Gameboy games, are justified because of dead internal batteries, which reminds me; I wish Nintendo would release the RSE games on VC already!

Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== So I got an email today saying the store will start adding sales tax to all orders in my state, Missouri, as of January 1st.

I think I’ve enjoyed it more then more recent starwars games (battlefront 2 EA) because they’re more to do, they have mini games, they have more story content, I actually care about the storyline, as I watched the original clone wars series. Battlefront 2 EA is too simple? I guess I could say that. Pick up a blaster, aim and click. It plays like a call of duty game with more health and in space. The LEGO games are made to be simple but they’re not boring. They have puzzles, and so much content. So many characters to choose from. I don’t really care if battlefront 2 is the best looking game out, it is honestly really bare bones and devoid of content. I think there are only like 10 maps or something, and 10 or so heroes on each side. I think there are 52 LEGO starwars 3 missions (I’m probably wrong) and I know there are a shitload of characters. I’m not sure if there was dlc or not, but it feels like a complete game. Battlefront 2, where is mace windu? Where is Jango fett? Ashoka tano, Aayla secura, luminara, asajj ventress, commando droids, captain rex and captain Cody? Where are the Jedi starfighters? Why are there so few maps? Christophsis? Utapau? Dantooine? Battlefront 2 feels devoid of content, and I would rather have more content then the best looking game. I would rather pay for DLC that’s completely full of content, like take up my whole console space, then get 2 heroes and a map for free in a year.

Most current gen AAA titles have about the same demands these days, give or take. Now I know you're going to say ""But Doom doesn't run well!"", and sure it doesn't run nearly as well as the other consoles. But it does run, is playable, and sold some copies. That's the argument you're having. You're saying modern AC won't run well, and it won't. But it'll be playable. And it'll sell some copies.

A prime example: The rise of âclassicâ shrunken-down versions of decades-old video game consoles, loaded with favorite games from yesteryear. While Nintendo popularized the trend, Sonyâs now getting in on the action with its $99 PlayStation Classic, a miniature replica of the iconic PlayStation with two controllers and 20 games. But despite the appealing design and potential to relive some of your favorite moments in video game history, Sonyâs PlayStation Classic is a frustrating device. Barebones in terms of extras and marred by flaws, it may leave both hardcore PlayStation fans and casual gamers feeling as if itâs little more than an attempt to capitalize on the nostalgia of older Millennial gamers who now have disposable income of their own to spend. The PlayStation Classic looks identical to the original 1994 console, down to the pair of included joystick-free controllers. But itâs 45% smaller than the original and only plays the included games, so donât expect it to read any PlayStation discs you might have lying about. You wonât need a memory card, either, as everything just saves to the system itself. Like other âclassicâ consoles released by Nintendo and Sega, the PlayStation Classic is just a tiny computer running a PlayStation software emulator, with some ports for controllers and an HDMI cable. It looks cool, and reminds me of the console I never owned but desperately desired. But, of course, itâs all about the games. The Classic has a selection of 20 well-known titles, though whether youâll enjoy the selection depends on your tastes. Iconic games like RPG Final Fantasy VII, fighting simulator Tekken 3, and stealth-centric Metal Gear Solid are present, so youâll no doubt find something you remember enjoying, or might enjoy for the first time around now. But more influential titles, like adventure game Spyro the Dragon or rhythm game PaRappa The Rapper are nowhere to be found, while other included games like Syphon Filter and Battle Arena Toshinden simply take up space due to their similarity to the more popular entries already present. Whatever the reason, Sonyâs choice of âclassicâ games to include on the system is unexciting. Even more confusing is the use of nine titles formatted for European televisions rather than North American televisions, leading to a handful of games that run slightly slower than the other offerings on the device. While you can save games traditionally using the âvirtualâ memory card, hitting the reset button on the console itself will automatically create a save âsnapshotâ of the game you were playing, letting you jump right back in whenever youâd like. Thatâs cool, but it only creates one snapshot at a time, so you canât create multiple snapshots before inflection points like boss battles. By comparison, Nintendoâs SNES Classic allows for up to four save slots per title. Unfortunately, both the PlayStation Classicâs software and hardware stand in the way of truly enjoying the throwback experience. For one, you wonât be able to use it out of the box. Sony is seemingly paying homage to the old âbatteries not includedâ stinger that plagued toy advertisements in the 90âs by omitting a power source. Instead there is only a Micro-USB cable for connecting the Classic to a powered USB-A port, though youâll have to provide that part of the equation yourself. The charging adapter that came with your smartphone will work just fine, thankfully. The PlayStation Classicâs home screen is pretty barren, and the software emulating the games lacks many of the gameplay-enhancing features found in other versions of the Classicâs emulator available online. No rewind functionality, no anti-aliasing for smoother graphics, no use of improved textures, and only a single slot for instant game save snapshots. In addition, the two controllers are flawed in several ways. The attached cables are too short in length for comfortable play on your couch, so you may end up sitting on the floor (Nintendoâs NES Classic had the same problem, which that company fixed with the SNES Classic). Also missing is the pair of joysticks present on the first DualShock controllers that shipped with later versions of the PlayStation. That makes navigating, aiming weapons, and driving cars a frustrating task, sloppily accomplished with the controllerâs directional or shoulder buttons. Compared to Nintendoâs $59 NES Classic and $79 SNES Classic consoles, Sonyâs $99 PlayStation Classic isnât offering much for the price, either. The NES Classic included 30 of its most well-known games, offered multiple save slots per title, and its own power adapter. The SNES offers mostly the same, and while it only includes 21 titles, one of them is the previously unreleased Starfox 2. Sure, all three peddle nostalgia for profit, but Nintendo does it better, and offers more for less. The PlayStation Classic is a story of missed potential. Proper DualShock controllers (included with later versions of the original console) would have made many of the games easier to play and more enjoyable overall. While licensing issues are usually to blame when it comes to reviving old games, access to an online store with a handful of extra titles would at least give those unsatisfied with the included selection an opportunity to choose from even more games, possibly with more titles added later on. And an included power supply would save everyone the headache that is figuring out how to even turn it on. Instead, Sony presented fans with a neutered version of one of the most influential consoles ever made, removed its best features, and neglected its most enjoyable titles. You really want to feel some nostalgia? I suggest you visit eBay and get an original PlayStation. Now thatâs cool.

180770634246,12/3/2018,http://nikhilshakya5.tumblr.com/post/180770634246,"PlayStation Network services are currently offline, which means online gaming, shopping, and communication is currently unavailable on the PS4. The PlayStation Network service status page states account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Now; Vue; Video; Store; and Music are all inaccessible.

“You may have some difficulty launching games, applications, or online features,” a message on the site reads. “Our engineers are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and we thank you for your patience.”

Based on messages directed at the various PlayStation support accounts on Twitter, it looks like the outage is widespread, with users both in the US and Europe reporting issues with connectivity. Sony has not provided a timeframe for when it expects services to be up and running again. The actual cause of the issue has also not been detailed.

With any luck, the problems won’t be severe and the service should be up and running again soon. Of course, outage at this time of the year immediately sparks memories of 2011, when PlayStation Network was severely compromised by hackers. In that situation, services were not restored for a significant length of time.

Besides thats I have no heard of most of these 50 games and the few that I've heard about arent very good. Also I already got For Honor and Limbo free on PC so its not really a great list for me. This is why I prefer Game pass. Today Mutant Year Zero is launching which I had my eye on. That game alone gives me more value for the subsciption than the 50 games on that list. But this month also has Ori (one of my favorite metroidvania games), Hellblade, and potentially Ashen (arriving same day it launches). At the very least I wish Sony put more well known games than just spamming indies. Horizon Zero Dawn will be 2 years old soon something like that would be great on PSNow and I would take that over the 50 titles here.",,sakata32,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed.

Well, I'm here to tell you that not everyone has a problem with lag. In fact, some people adore it, pray for it, slowly caress their nether regions while thinking about it. Those people are me. I'm a dirty lagger and I'm here to tell you why lag is good. Have you ever played Smash against someone way better than you? Someone who can run circles around your character with one hand while swiping left on Tinder with the other? Someone who can eat a melting ice cream sandwich, catch all the drips with a napkin, and *still* 3-stock you? (Fuck you, Mark.) If so, lag is your new best friend. You see, lag doesn't care about fancy punish combos, short-hop-fast-fall aerials, or how quickly you can give yourself carpal tunnel syndrome by flicking a control stick back and forth. When I queue into a game running slower than a Powerpoint presentation streamed through Playstation Now, I thank our lord and savior Sakurai for the gift and crack my knuckles. Because while everyone else is preparing to play “Super Smash Bros., but slow and laggy,” I’m readying myself a completely different game. You may have heard of it; it’s called chess. I may suck at Smash, but I am a professional player of Smash chess with a rating of over 2300 Falcon kicks. I plan my moves not milliseconds, but minutes in advance. I know exactly where you are going to be long before your up-b out of shield option is a twinkle in your perfect parry’s eye. While you’re buffering your first dash grab, I’ve already planned the next 20 attacks that end with you below the stage without a sliver of hope or a second jump. Check-mate, Melee elitists. To the untrained eye, it may appear as though I stand in the center of the stage mindlessly spamming f-smashes and projectiles. However, I can assure you that the trajectory and timing of every attack has been meticulously calculated to upset your delicate ego and make you reset your game in frustration, which will only result in a 30-minute ban from online play. I am a warrior of the mind as well as a warrior of the controller. Don’t feel too bad; it’s hard to win a game you don’t even know you’re playing. See you on Big Blue.

So jumping from one to the other is probably better. 3 will have gameplay that is fast and decent. Bosses are great and areas are fun (dlc too). 2 seems to be a hit and miss. A lot of people like and some dislike it. I personally wasnt too fond of the second game, BUT, the combat diversity with weapons are awesome. 3 has weapon arts, that drains ""mana"" for special moves, while the second has dual weapon type options that made it really interesting. I wasnt to fond of most of the bosses. Felt more like quantity over quality. Dark souls 1 is more clunky if youre used to DS3/Bloodborne, but has this ""open world"" kind of feel to it, that makes it really interesting. Demon souls... Id only really recommend this if either: you have a ps3, or a kick ass internet that can stream it from psnow or whatever its called. Im really biased about it, since its the very first game I ever played of the series, so itll hold a special place in my heart. But yeah.

I don't know what PSNow's like, and xCloud is still up in the air ( ) but I can happily play Spider-Man via Remote Play, at my friend's house, which is roughly a 20 minute drive . Click to expand... Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed. You can just build one epic installation in some cheap country and serve the whole world from there. ====================::==================== mrcorbo said: ↑ The pull Quote: about the ability to leverage the silicon being developed for Project xCloud and, by extension, Project Scarlet for non-gaming workloads is interesting. It makes we wonder in what ways that might affect the design and what goes into it. Are we just talking standard x86 CPU and GPU processing units or will there be more custom hardware that maps well to machine learning? Click to expand... You know what it tells me? MS is constitutionally incapable of focusing on console gaming as a goal in and of itself. It is the same mistake they have made time and time again. It torpedoed the design of the Xbox One and it's sales potential. And now they are planning to make the same mistakes, in a different way next gen. It's the same thing I have warned people about in the past, but everyone wants to believe things are different under Spencer and Nadella. This makes it pretty clear that is not the case. The greater company only cares about Xbox in as far as it can be leveraged for something else. In the past this has always resulted in a compromised experience for console gamers compared to platforms that do not see their hardware as a stepping stone to something more lucrative.",,bgroovy,Germany,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,Next Generation Hardware Speculation with a Technical Spin [2018] | Page 198,,,

Well, I'm here to tell you that not everyone has a problem with lag. In fact, some people adore it, pray for it, slowly caress their nether regions while thinking about it. Those people are me. I'm a dirty lagger and I'm here to tell you why lag is good. Have you ever played Smash against someone way better than you? Someone who can run circles around your character with one hand while swiping left on Tinder with the other? Someone who can eat a melting ice cream sandwich, catch all the drips with a napkin, and still 3-stock you? (Fuck you, Mark.) If so, lag is your new best friend. You see, lag doesn't care about fancy punish combos, short-hop-fast-fall aerials, or how quickly you can give yourself carpal tunnel syndrome by flicking a control stick back and forth. When I queue into a game running slower than a Powerpoint presentation streamed through Playstation Now, I thank our lord and savior Sakurai for the gift and crack my knuckles. Because while everyone else is preparing to play “Super Smash Bros., but slow and laggy,” I’m readying myself a completely different game. You may have heard of it; it’s called chess. I may suck at Smash, but I am a professional player of Smash chess with a rating of over 2300 Falcon kicks. I plan my moves not milliseconds, but minutes in advance. I know exactly where you are going to be long before your up-b out of shield option is a twinkle in your perfect parry’s eye. While you’re buffering your first dash grab, I’ve already planned the next 20 attacks that end with you below the stage without a sliver of hope or a second jump. Check-mate, Melee elitists. To the untrained eye, it may appear as though I stand in the center of the stage mindlessly spamming f-smashes and projectiles. However, I can assure you that the trajectory and timing of every attack has been meticulously calculated to upset your delicate ego and make you reset your game in frustration, which will only result in a 30-minute ban from online play. I am a warrior of the mind as well as a warrior of the controller. Don’t feel too bad; it’s hard to win a game you don’t even know you’re playing. See you on Big Blue.

I DREAM about a japanese studio ====================::==================== iroboto said: ↑ I’ve not commented on Sony mainly because I don’t know what they’ll do. I only know what MS is doing because it’s inline with everything else they do, subscriptions to azure, office, ML, etc. Curiously, what has Sony said? I don’t believe that Sony have the infrastructure and labour force that MS does to support such a service. I don’t think that they can effectively scale a world class streaming service to millions of users simultaneously across the world. They certainly are good at supply chain, but cloud services is not their forte. Sony isn’t an internet company, that’s not been their core strength and honestly speaking we haven’t seen them make major moves to in both careers and labour force to be able to compete with MS squarely. They don’t have the data centres and they definitely don’t have the people. Google and MS as businesses are doing their best to land as many data centres as close to people’s homes as possible to reduce latency for real time applications (self driving etc). That just happens to lend well for real time gaming too. There is a reason why Sony hasn’t been part of this particular discussion but Google has been. Anyone thinking that Sony can compete with MS in this space with equivalent margins is folly. MS’ current largest source of revenue is cloud services and they continue to invest heavily into infrastructure to support it. They’ve built the entire company around cloud and I can’t see how a company like Sony will be able to build the capital and labour force to compete properly in this space. I work for a telco, and the biggest fear right now are google, Facebook and MS barreling into the market trying to build capacity closer to the last mile to reduce latency. I’ve not heard a single word of Sony ever come up. Ever. If I do, I’ll let you know. Right now MS gaming is just piggy backing off their other services. I wouldn’t be so quick to carve it up as some brilliant strategy to win the gaming market. If this happens to be the major battleground for next gen, while Sony clearly cannot build the capability to compete, they can partner with a company that has the capability and work the market that way. Google is looking well setup to take on MS in this space. There could also be others Click to expand... MS have an important cloud service. So their infrastructure would be similar to AWS, google, and facebook. Very centralised. From interviews about the PSNow infrastructure, Sony is more like Netflix. Small rack space close to the edge. Very distributed. The theory was that datacenters are better for a cloud services because clients often need massive inter-node bandwidth and large local storage, with backup services, and be able to rent thousands of nodes in the same location.

They email a lot of 20% off codes and have digital sales that are sometimes better than Xbox sales. They get the importance of price point now. That doesn't make sense to me. In the past, I noticed Sony fetched higher prices on the standard PS4 SKU than XB1, but it looks like that is changing. >Sony was smart enough with the pro though. I don't think many people care about the power. Microsoft is trying really hard to push the industry forward and I love that. Sony is sticking to an old model but again, it works for them. I think they ""felt"" they made a mistake to be honest, and why Andrew House is out, and they had the 2016 PSX assault of everything they had in development shown. Even games that is very early in development like TLOU2. >Microsoft has gotta get their message for next generation out clearly when they present Scarlet. It's gotta be choice and it's gotta be cheaper than the competition. I think the approach MS will take is two prong i.e. two consoles. One lower priced and one premium. Either way, the prices will be close to Sony, and if they decide to push on power they will eat the cost. I'm not sure Sony is willing to do that. I get the feeling Sony is not evolving fast enough and that their platform is stagnant. They got the good exclusive content, but there is some negative sentiment around Playstation, now. I don't know if that will build or not or if they can move to a more modern business model. We will see.",,YouAreSalty,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

It's funny you mention Seamus Blackley was worried about Microsoft treating it as a PC when a lot of the OG Xbox ""exclusive"" games did find their way on to PC it was only in the 360 days where that was reined in but in general a lot of Xbox games have a history of being on PC.

Based on messages directed at the various PlayStation support accounts on Twitter, it looks like the outage is widespread, with users both in the US and Europe reporting issues with connectivity. Sony has not provided a timeframe for when it expects services to be up and running again. The actual cause of the issue has also not been detailed.

It is a huge 140B USD business, that seems to grow in double digits every year. So, as a bunch of armchair no-nothings, lets try and figure out where they are going with all this. 140B USD growth market ~70 billion from mobile (double digit growth every year) ~70 billion from PC and console (single digit growth) ~90% from digital content. Microsoft has no mobile presence, so it will focus on PC and console. On PC, their big problem is that Win32 is open and allows anyone to sell software without going through Microsoft. They make no money from Steam, Battle.net, EA origins, etc. UWP is their answer to that. It is a platform that has many advantages and is where MS is investing their talent and resources wrt Windows. It will take years, but eventually the benefits of UWP will make the outdated Win32 and uncontrolled software vendors a definite second choice for customers. To work, MS store has to be the go to software hub for people, and uwp has to be clearly superior. Timeline is probably 5 to 10 years. On console, they need to offer better hardware, better services, and better content. For content: buying studios, starting studios, and growing current studios are happening. For hardware: MS has gotten serious about making attractive kit that competes well against the competition by tapping their logistics and hardware talent for their gaming division. In 2018, Xbox build quality, power, aesthetics, and noise are all superior to Sony's offerings. As for services, they are offering new things like Gamepass, impressive backward compatibility, access to other subscription models like EA access, and soon, xstream Is this all related to becoming the Netflix of gaming as the end point? I don't think so. IMO, gamepass is designed to be a better PSNow in order to make the overall xbox platform more appealing, just as making better hardware and having more original content does. It also serves as a way to get low end PC gamers into the windows store ecosystem. They aren't going to limit how people can market and sell games and content in xbox/windows. They will want premium games, free to play games, subscription services, and everything else being offered, all going through their store. The idea is to have everyone who makes games selling on their store(S) any way they want, and to have the maximum number of customers available for those makers to to sell to; not to try and force everything through a Netflix model. In order to do that, they need to be the most competitive platform. MS is in a good spot to take a majority chunk of the non-mobile gaming market over the next decade. They own Windows, they own a recognizable console brand, they have world class software engineering talent, world class analytics, a well funded AI division, mountains of cash, and a lot of power. I can see them dominating PC+console gaming in 2030. Of course, presupposes no other companies are going to disrupt things. I still look forward to the day that I have a single computing device that fits in my pocket, and when that happens, that is what I'll game on.",,joe_zazen,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,,,,

The last system I owned was a Nintendo Wii and, prior to that, a Sega Saturn. I've always been primarily a PC gamer, but I'm trying to expand my options. I've discovered that I am absolutely horrible at games that require me to use both thumbsticks simultaneously as well as buttons at the same time. I'm hoping that, in time, I can get better at this. But, in the mean time, I've been looking for games that don't use the right thumbstick or that use it in a very limited capacity. The older God of War games have been easy for me to adjust to. However, most of the games I come across seem to rely on extensive use of the right thumbstick. I was wondering if you guys could suggest any games (either on PlayStation Now or that I'd have to purchase) that don't rely heavily on the right thumbstick. I'm hoping that, in time, I can overcome this limitation, but until I'm more used to a gamepad, I need to find the right games.

I was in the Nintendo Spirit so I went to get my switch, and popped in Splatoon 2. I go thorough about a minute of stuff, waltz over to the multiplayer area and boom: it happens. It says: Online services are now available with a Nintendo Switch Online Membership Now, I looked at myself and I said “Well that is some complete bullshit.” I don’t want to spend however much money it is to play a game online which I was able to play for free like 4 months ago. Now, I don’t want to sound like some choosy beggar, but the fact I don’t get to play the online features on Splatoon 2 and Pokken Tournament is disappointing, but it isn’t disappointing enough where as it would drive me to by and online membership like I would my PlayStation. Now, I was just asking for your guys’ opinion on if I should sell my switch games. I mean, I’ve only put roughly ~35 hours on the online games and I’ll admit it was really, really fun. Now, I don’t know if I should in fact get mad at Nintendo for making me pay if I want to play online. I mean, it was nice when they didn’t do it, but hey-they gotta make money somehow I guess. Now, I only have like three games I play online on, so do you guys think it would be worth it for me to buy that online membership? I mean, I would technically only play Splatoon so it doesn’t seem like much of a beneficiary. Anyways, that’s about it on what I have to say. If you’ve read this to the end, thanks for doing so and I’d be glad to hear your opinion.",,Mickey_thicky,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,M,,,,,,,

MS is constitutionally incapable of focusing on console gaming as a goal in and of itself. It is the same mistake they have made time and time again. It torpedoed the design of the Xbox One and it's sales potential. And now they are planning to make the same mistakes, in a different way next gen. It's the same thing I have warned people about in the past, but everyone wants to believe things are different under Spencer and Nadella. This makes it pretty clear that is not the case. The greater company only cares about Xbox in as far as it can be leveraged for something else. In the past this has always resulted in a compromised experience for console gamers compared to platforms that do not see their hardware as a stepping stone to something more lucrative. Click to expand... Well, this is how I see it. Allowing the hardware that will be powering instances on Project xCloud to also be utilized for other cloud computing tasks will allow them to massively over-provision the initial server rollout for the Project xCloud service without having to worry about that hardware sitting idle while the subscriber base is still low. This should guarantee the best possible experience for this service from day one and will continue to allow for aggressive expansion of the server resources available since MS have minimized the downside risk of those investments. This also means that when MS solicits bids from suppliers, technology partners and manufacturing facilities the contracts they will be offering have the potential to be more lucrative than if they were for the design and manufacture of just a console design. This should allow them to secure more favorable terms in these contracts as the larger scale will allow for partners to make more money over a comparable period of time even with lower per-unit revenue. Finally, MS have been able to invest so massively in producing games because those games will effectively be multi-platform across Xbox consoles, PC, and Project xCloud. MS have never demonstrated a stronger commitment to gaming at any time in their history then they are right now. And this commitment is enabled by them not just making a new console.",,mrcorbo,Germany,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,Next Generation Hardware Speculation with a Technical Spin [2018] | Page 198,,,

Click to expand... A lot of that feeds into why when xcloud was announced and said it was based on 1S hardware I said I suspect that it means Scarlett apu was far from being ready, hence next Xbox being 2020 at the earliest. I think that they will do a very limited test and roll out of the current xcloud. They just needed to show they was in the streaming game. With Scarlett apu's in the cloud they can probably run multiple XO's on one apu, and now use it for other workloads (which I considered but had no basis to throw it out there), and get a solid base performance and resolution prior to compression that you won't get with the 1S. It's also one of the other reasons I think there's a higher chance of MS being chipplet and possibly mcm based. Putting the apu's in both consoles and racks will help spread the costs and even more bining options of the apu's. All this could have a very good impact on the cost to perf of the console, or even what becomes viable in a console. Anyone thinking this shows less commitment to console gaming, just refuses to see the benefits of spreading the costs, especially when you consider everyone else will be doing streaming also.",,Jay,Germany,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,M,,,,Next Generation Hardware Speculation with a Technical Spin [2018] | Page 198,,,

You talk about controlling the marketplace and that's something you CAN'T do right now in PC, not even with Denuvo doing the rounds... I know piracy is not an argument for low sales on PC or whatever but publishers usually don't think the same... that's why I'm not so sure Microsoft wouldn't stall a PC release of a really big blockbuster like Halo. Every company is becoming a service company eventually... that is the transition, even Sony with PSNow... but we still got one or two hardware generations to go fully that way... hardware sales for Microsoft should still matter because of the fully closed garden architecture that they can't have on PC... that and console gamers who want to play online HAVE to pay for Gold which is MORE MONEY for them... time will tell, I'm not completely discounting Microsoft will continue support for PC but I definitely don't think is so clear cut as to think there is not a possibility that eventually Microsoft can go back a little on their word.",,PrfctPrfct,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

It’s no secret that most of Sony/Microsoft revenue/profit right now comes from their services. That’s where their future lies. I mean, I already play Microsoft games on my pc. If I could access Sony services on my PC, I would subscribe and purchase many games (right now, they don’t get any money from me) Click to expand... Now it makes sense why you tend to attack Sony but let Microsoft slide. I noticed this with PC gamers nowadays. They generally like Microsoft because they can access their games on their PC, but are annoyed by Sony because they can't. They deal with Nintendo because they can buy their system as a secondary one or emulate their games. Click to expand... I bring up Sony over Microsoft because they are the current home console market leader, plain and simple. In a Nintendo dedicated forum full of negative trolls who bash Nintendo and Nintendo systems for not being more like the market leader...you kind of have to combat it by also bringing up the market leader in similar ways. I owned a ps3, Wii was the global market leader...Xbox was the US market leader...I really never had to single out Sony or PlayStation anything before the Wii U arrived. And I’ve played past playstation games on my PC through PsNow...so it’s definitely has nothing to do about pc access I have absolutely no doubt ps4 games will be playable on my pc at some point in the near future.

In order to compete you need a constant stream of content, if you only have bi-yearly FP content then people will unsubscribe. However the most important problem I believe will be the sacrifice of profit. Netflix when it released was in DEEP Red for profit, it took many years and quarters for the investment to pay off. They aggressively bought original IPs and spent Billions on new content to make the platform attractive internationally and domestically. Microsoft's case is MUCH more extreme, they spent years and 100s of millions in the red for online services like Bing and 10 years later is starting to make money. Like I say, if Sony is willing to bank their whole company onto something like the Netflix-model they will have to stay red and in a deep money pit for a long time. That’s some scary shit and actually seeing it on a spreadsheet really puts things into perspective, at least for me it does. Can’t imagine the “leap of faith” this must be for some companies especially if it takes longer than originally forecasted. I mean I know and understand that things like this are very well analyzed and risk/issue vs potential profit are very well researched but damn that many months or years in the red has got to be nerve wrenching. I would tend to agree, even with Sony’s huge portfolio of games, movies and music it would take a division well into the black to fund or a lot of investment opportunities. Guess we’ll see where it goes, but I would tend to think Sony’s approach would (and should) be more conservative if they are indeed heading in that direction full force. Not sure they are however.

Right. It's local. When on the road around the world, accessing servers in Washington, you have an inherent very long delay just in the time it takes the signal to travel thousands of miles, let alone routing. The implication is that MS have latency down to playable across the world, despite the fact we know pings across continents can easily be 200+ ms. It's an implication that shouldn't be made, because it's borderline impossible and why these companies are trying to get servers closer to where they are needed.

The aim would be to have games running at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. This would align with earlier rumors on the PlayStation 5 hardware, which pointed to an eight-core Zen CPU and a Navi-based GPU. Once again, both next-gen consoles by Sony and Microsoft could be powered by AMD technology. For the next generation, Microsoft is going to take a varied approach, releasing different types of hardware that will be able to run games through the cloud, like a cheap Xbox console that runs game via the Azure infrastructure, as well as traditional hardware. The company is going to be embracing digital distribution even further, bringing changes to the Windows Store (as promised by Phil Spencer, Executive Vice President of Gaming at Microsoft) and Xbox App and creating a unified system. Backward compatibility is also in the cards, which is not surprising considering how well it’s doing on Xbox One. All of this information has not been confirmed officially, so we have to take it with a grain of salt for the time being. If the console is indeed coming in 2020, we will finally hear more about it sometime next year, possibly at E3 2019; after all, Microsoft already announced the Xbox One X console a year and a half before it actually shipped. Reports are it will lean on the Cloud to gain an advantage over the PS5 which is also slated to run on AMD's Zen2 + Navi hardware: https://www.inverse.com/article/515...how-microsoft-will-use-cloud-to-beat-sony-ps5 Inverse said: Microsoft’s next Xbox console could leverage cloud technology to gain the upper hand over Sony, a report published Wednesday claims. Brad Sams, who previously reported that the upcoming “Scarlett” machine would launch in 2020, claims that the diminishing returns from more powerful hardware will push the two companies to find other ways to differentiate themselves, leading to a new tech race no longer governed by flashy specs and high resolutions. “Hardware differentiator, I think in the next gen, isn’t going to be as big of a deal as the previous gen,” Sams said, explaining how Microsoft and Sony are both likely to offer 4K resolution gaming at a smooth 60 frames per second, but consumers are unlikely to spot the difference with even higher pixel counts or framerates. This will mean offering alternative benefits, like services, price points and cloud technology. In the case of the latter, Microsoft plans to offer Netflix-like game streaming for more casual players and cloud-based processing to enhance high-end games. Microsoft announced its game streaming service in October, Project xCloud, which will leverage its 54 Azure cloud service regions to offer a variety of games without the need for downloads, running over a connection of just 10 megabits per second. The service acts as a competitor to PlayStation Now, which offers access to hundreds of PS4, PS3 and PS2 games for $19.99 per month, and xCloud is expected to start public trials in 2019. Sams previously claimed that Microsoft will offer a streaming-only “Scarlett” box for around $100, saving hundreds of dollars upfront for more casual players that are less concerned about pixel-perfect performance. Tweaktown said: RuthenticCookie on Reddit said that the PS5 is a beast capable of ""4K/60 stable and at the same time kinda monster"" and lines up with what I expect, and what I said in my report on Sony working directly with RTG engineers on the Navi GPU for the PlayStation 5. In my article, I said: ""Sony needs the next-gen PS5 to truly drive 4K 60FPS if it's going to be released in 2020-2022 where 4K will be greatly established at the time. The next generation of consoles need to offer 4K 60FPS at a minimum if they want to keep up with mid-range GPUs in 2020-2027 (given that the PS5 is released in 2020, and lasts for 5-7 years)"". If these consoles indeed drop this early, around Fall/Winter 2020, then part of me wonders if these early leaks may be misleading in representing the next generation of consoles, and if ""backwards compatibility"" should just be ""compatibility"". It's a generational overhaul, from a hardware point of view, jumping from AMD's Bobcat family (the ""Jaguar"" architecture) to their latest Ryzen family (Zen 2), but otherwise there doesn't look like any significant reason for these consoles to be a brand new generation rather than a [email protected] update to the current PS4/XB1 8th generation improving upon the Xbox One Elite & PS4 Pro. If the leak suggestions are correct, and this is a whole new generation of consoles, I can't wait for the same gamers who work so hard to pretend they ""don't care about slight graphical improvements"", like those in this recent thread, to suddenly swoon over ""[email protected] BRO!!!!!"", and relentlessly hype how amazing these new consoles are on those grounds to justify a purchase since at launch their game libraries will be practically nonexistent for the first year (just as they were with the PS4/XB1 all the way up to 2015). Psychology is weird like that.",,Madmick,United States of America,California,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I've always loved Nintendo's first party games but I feel like for the first time none of the games Nintendo is releasing are really...targeted for me. Breath of the Wild: My single biggest disappointment. Apparently there are people that find Zelda has always been about exploration and others that found it was about puzzles. BoTW was all about exploration and I felt it was severely lacking in the puzzle department. Odyssey: A step in the right direction from 3D world, but too many stupidly easy moons that are just a bother to find but really easy to get. I felt like it was made so the casual player could easily beat it. Now there were some super cool challenging and fun parts but I just felt there was too much fluff added in. Pokemon: Trying to bring in the casual go audience. I really wanted a core remake of yellow which we now won't be getting. Still having quite a bit of fun with it though. I do miss the other mons and abilities a lot though. Smash: I feel it's much more catered to the fan of the fighter. My favorite smash is by far Brawl. I loved subspace. Played through that so many times. As a result I played through classic a lot too and just enjoyed the game. 3ds I played a decent bit of smash run but never put nearly as much time into it as I did Brawl. I barely touched the Wii U one. Kirby Star allies just felt too...idk simple maybe? There are other games I love on switch and wouldn't trade it for the world. I love Mario + rabbids, love octopath traveler, loved Shantae Half Genie hero, hollow knight, blossom tales. Hyrule warriors was a blast. I guess...I'm asking if anyone else feels like Nintendo games are evolving in a different way than they would like or am I maybe just getting tired of Nintendo games? If you're getting tired of Nintendo games then maybe its time that you switched to a different company for a while and then come back later. This because 3 of the games you mentioned (Zelda BOTW, Super Mario Odyessy, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate) are stellar hits for the company and it seems like you personally just can't get into it because you're probably tired out. There is nothing wrong with that. I felt that way two years ago when their games weren't appealing to me and decided to get a PS4. I don't regret that decision. I'm planning to get Bloodborne in a week or so after exams to see what its like. So like I said, take a break from Nintendo games for a while and try some games from other companies! That's basically what I'm doing. I'm on PSNow on PC currently playing Blazblue Central Fiction, playing Artifact on Steam, and playing FFVII Crisis Core. I'm also playing Infinite Minigolf, but I did buy that on the Switch.",,Mozzezz,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

How about already happening: GeForce Now, PSNow, Vortex, etc. The infrastructure is there already and the foundations for this paradigm are springing up right in front of our faces. No need for everyone to have gigabit speed; ping doesn't matter for single-player offerings; they can quietly stream more than enough data as you play to make it a seamless experience. Multiplayer is surprisingly nowhere near as atrocious as it seems it would be. Besides, it would be easy enough for game companies to mitigate lag by having players do an initial load of assets needed for certain visuals, etc. All logic can reside on the server, and with hardened-enough APIs, detecting anomalies would be made much easier. Go read the technical specs of the three services I listed above. Heck, try them out if you want.

Irithyll Dungeon is a recreation of the Tower of Latria from Demon's Souls and is awesome. So demons is the only one I haven’t played because I got into these in 2016 on ps4. So I’m either waiting for psnow to carry it, a remaster or I buy another damn ps3 just for that game, is it worth 80 bucks to buy a ps3 for the game? I read people always stating tower of Latria as one of the best areas with the best atmosphere yet myself and many think irythyll dungeon is a chore to go through? It’s not my favourite area, not even close. I thought all games had good atmosphere but of all of them I’ve played BB nails atmosphere the best. Hard to say - I love Demon's Souls but I'm not sure that I, personally, would buy any console to play one game. Not sure if the Tower of Latria would feel slightly different to you in Demons. You are likely to be there earlier in the game, so it has a bit more of a 'skulking about' feeling than Irithyll, even though they are essentially the same space. The jailers in Demons, known there as Mindflayers, carry chimes that ring out ominously... creepy AF. I could hear those chimes in my mind while playing DS3 lol. The second area of the Tower of Latria is more fleshed out than the Profaned Capital in DS3. In DS3, when you first walk out to the path high above the Profaned Capital, if you look to the left you can see a spire - this is literally where your character begins the second area of Latria in Demon's Souls. The area is not as damaged though and there is more to explore before the boss.",,johnrayjr,United States of America,,,Positive,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,

All the games I listed launched on game pass. In fact whats the most recent game that launched among the 50 games added? I think its maybe Bugsby? I'm not talking strictly about the quality of games because you could argue Bloodborne is better than all those games. I'm talking about the value of those games and Bloodborne was recently on sale for $7 I believe. Forza Horizon 4 on launch day alone is more valuable than a ps3 stream of Last of Us, and Uncharted and a copy of a game that you can buy for $7. Just look at the 50 games added. Mutant Year Zero and Ashen alone are more valuable than those games because of how recent they are.

In order to compete you need a constant stream of content, if you only have bi-yearly FP content then people will unsubscribe. However the most important problem I believe will be the sacrifice of profit. Netflix when it released was in DEEP Red for profit, it took many years and quarters for the investment to pay off. They aggressively bought original IPs and spent Billions on new content to make the platform attractive internationally and domestically. Microsoft's case is MUCH more extreme, they spent years and 100s of millions in the red for online services like Bing and 10 years later is starting to make money. Like I say, if Sony is willing to bank their whole company onto something like the Netflix-model they will have to stay red and in a deep money pit for a long time.

Your household electricity provider can cut off your power at any point have you considered running your own nuclear plant? Secondly if this dumb eventuallity were to occur there are other providers. I'm sure Sony don't even use AWS for PSNow anyway but not 100% certain. Pricing matters though, price matters more than almost anything when we are dealing with consoles and services. If Microsoft and say Amazon offer a cheaper, more stable service, it will be noticed. The benefits of owning your own cloud services not to mention the two biggest services around. It will be interesting to see how Sony deals and handles the cloud services as they evolved. I don’t think Sony is dead in the water, they do have a great loyal fan base, but I can only imagine the eventuality of... lets say Google or Amazon attempts to buy out Sony, I don’t see Microsoft doing it, but it’s one way Sony may be out of the picture in the future.",,Pallas,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,
