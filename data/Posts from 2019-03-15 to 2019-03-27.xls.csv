Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,mad-girl-with-a-bow-tie,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

Are they offering this *only* for games you own? Not as far as I know. I have a feeling that xCloud gaming will be a *part* of gamepass, the same way that Netflix and PSNow support downloding OR streaming (though not for all titles in either case). Have we heard officially if it will be separate? (or a download plan VS a download + stream plan?) It doesn't take many purchases forgone (due to the game showing up in the service) to make it well worth it. Like MS 1st parties alone will quickly make Game Pass worth subbing every year. PSNow is over 800 games now, iirc, and growing. It's biggest challenge is that Sony doesn't natively have access to players outside of its existing ecosystem (big problem) and they don't have the cloud power that MS/Google have to ensure the best possible experience. The more PS4 games they add to it though, the more they can offer to download as an option. Google's entrenched access to consumers through Android (in general) and Youtube specifically will make them very powerful if it gets the attention of casuals. They could leverage into being playable locally on a PC as well, if they want, though I wonder if they will.",,killbot0224,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I love creating stories with my sims and even when I do challenges like NSB and all that I still create story that could be unique to other challenges you would see which is fun. I do love creative writing (I mean it's my minor in college) so I guess that's part of the reason why I like to create stories through my sims, however at the current moment I'm starting a SimLit legacy story soon, just trying to plan out what direction I want to take it.

Also, depending on your perspective it can be either a pro or a con. I don't play a lot of games, but when I play a game I play it for a long time so a monthly subscription for this would be just a waste of money for my use case. I'm just the type of person that would replay DMC over and over until go through all the difficulties and master the mechanics by just playing DMC and nothing else for months and months. >If you're into streaming, you can easily stream onto YouTube. that's tricky. Streaming games (not to twitch) can actually be somewhat demanding to your device since it has to decode the video you're receiving in real time so then if you're also streaming to twitch you'd be decoding and then encoding it at the same time. This could be an issue, but I don't know how much of an issue. >Split screen is made much easier to do in their environment. Don't think so. Split screen also has game engine limitations. For example, there are videos of minecraft where people just stack hundreds of blocks of TNT and blow them up and the resulting explosion is just too much for the game to handle so it turns into a slideshow. This isn't a hardware limitation. >Latency shouldn't be an issue because you're not pinging a remote server. You're going over the Google backbone not exposed to the public Internet, so network latency if anything would be better especially for multiplayer games. You're still inserting a middle man into it. Instead of going from your pc to the game's server you're going to be going from your pc to google's machines running the games and then to the game's servers. You're still adding latency just by connecting to google's machines. For example, in came gomes I have 30 ping because there are servers close to me, but if Google's servers aren't as close then that's added latency. >Edit: more pros, you could also potentially have 1000s of players in one instance. You can also have great graphics and physics in an MMORPG. State sharing sounds like it could be both good and a bad thing. that's goes to the game engine limitations part. It's not like Stadia can change this because devs won't make game that only work using this tech. Even if Stadia becomes mainstream there still has to be transition period where you have to be able to play the games both on your pc and on Stadia. >Also, I'd like to add a con to your list. Google will definitely listen in on you constantly using the microphone on your controller. Hopefully there's a mute switch like Google Home. Ah, right, forgot they love to shove mics into everything. They just love tracking everything without telling you much ike they track your phone's location even if your gps is shut off.",,bleack114,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade.""

(this is with lock and this is with the game running on my machine, which minimizes some of the issues (input lag vs serverside). and it's just an arpg, which is less sensitive than most game types. most games, esp console games aren't this serious and generally don't make checks to maintain consistency between the client and the server (syncing). especially for single player. it would need to receive your inputs and send the response to visualize everything, effectively doubling the response time for many games (inputs on client side and displayed quickly, without having to send/receive confirmation from server with occasional syncs is a major QoL) google's service would have everything on the server's end. as good as one's internet is/can be, it won't really matter at all if the server isn't close enough/isn't stable enough. they'd need servers in basically every city - and even then, those not in cities would just be outright screwed. lolz @ diablo. d3 should be playable this way - it's why the combat was gutted (less data to send/receive) and made so stupidly simplistic (ie: one of the major reasons why it's a shit game). and d3 has rubberbanding issues still. but i guess it's now a phone game, so... you have a phone, right? MMO doesn't mean much, anymore (term is now too generic and often misused) - but i bet most of them would have major issues with this. MMOs tend to be pretty serious about keeping data on their own servers' sides, which means on top of the latency one would have from their end to google, they're would likely be additional latency from google to the game's server. unless they'd want an additional fragment to their playerbase (ie: stadia players isolated to a stadia server and other stadia players - a different realm) Click to expand... Trust me, I understand how input lag works. In the right scenario and for the right person, this is a viable solution.

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Pretty sure it takes 6 months or even a year for the titles to come out.

As they say, most gamers dont finish games either. Which is really a shame.

Also slightly annoyed by people on social media acting like this is some mind-blowing concept when game streaming is hardly new. Google might be doing the best version of it yet, but people ranting about this being a revolution are going a bit overboard with the hype. Something else to keep in mind - Google won't be alone in this endeavor. Sony and Microsoft already have streaming from consoles to various devices. And there's Playstation Now. Shawn Layden at Sony said we're already living in a post console world. IIRC the newly appointed CEO at Playstation was selected for reasons related to all this as they prepare for the launch of PS5. And Microsoft has been making moves to emphasize Xbox as a service/platform rather than a console. My guess is PS5 and Xbox 2 will be some sort of hybridization of classic consoles and the streaming platforms of the future. It could very well be the last generation of consoles with physical media.

It may not represent a huge portion of the entire gaming pie-- but that doesn't mean it's not a hugely profitable or successful thing. What people keep failing to understand is that the gaming pie is huge. You dont have to conquer the entire thing to generate a huge profit and run a successful company. That's great for companies, because it creates a lot of space to carve out a niche product group. It's also great for customers as it creates a wider choice of options for purchase consideration. As far as gamestop is concerned, of course, any move away from physical hardware and software is very bad news as it just makes their pie that much smaller. That, of course, is why gamestop has to change and be prepared to pivot away from being purely dependent on sales of those 2 product groups for their continued survival through the next decade.",,Meimnot555,United States of America,,,Negative,Joy,Reddit,,,,,,,,

183508277324,3/16/2019,http://lucasuwadi.tumblr.com/post/183508277324,"GPU-based cryptocurrency miners have taken a beating throughout this bear market — just ask NVIDIA. However, users with spare GPUs may soon be able to put their ineffective mining hardware to another profitable use: renting rendering power to those looking to experience quality PC gaming on an underpowered computer. 

As reported by TechCrunch, Vectordash is looking to allow people with underpowered rigs not meant for gaming — such as Apple computers — to experience quality PC gaming with the help of individuals willing to rent their spare power for cloud rendering. This means that, in theory, even those with a Macbook Air could game at 4K resolution and 60 frames-per-second, given their internet bandwidth is capable of handling that amount of data.

If this sounds too good to be true, it’s not. Cloud rendering itself is nothing particularly new, so this idea is far from half-baked. Sony launched a cloud rendering service in PlayStation Now years ago — though it never really took off. Nevertheless, the company proved that cloud rendering is a viable option for gaming going forward.

Vectordash’s service will apparently run users $28 per month for cloud rendering capabilities. On the other side of the deal, GPU renters stand to make about $0.60 per day — which isn’t life-changing money for anyone who has the dough to throw at high-powered GPUs. However, the ability to put less-than-profitable meant-for-mining GPUs to work for another reason may help those who have been beaten down by both a bear market and dramatically more powerful ASIC mining rigs.



The key for Vectordash, of course, is offering payments for renters that are competitively priced with cryptocurrency mining returns — which shouldn’t be too difficult, given that GPU mining returns are currently negligible.

What do you think about Vectordash and cloud rendering PC games? Do you have GPUs you bought for cryptocurrency mining that you no longer use? Let us know in the comments below!

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Pretty sure it takes 6 months or even a year for the titles to come out. So fifa 19 would have just been launched on it now but not 100 percent sure If so then that wouldn't make sense for lots of people except those wanting to play older titles I looked up the titles on Xbox access right now and fifa 18 and lower were on it but newest games were madden 19 and I think nba 19.

The latest ones will eventually appear on PSNow as well so if you are patient you can still play them on PC.

Sweet Jim Sterling that's a bad controller. Yup, this is going to be abandoned in a few years. But on the plus side, a lot of people are (ironically?) hoping for a 1983-style crash to bring down the AAA developers.

Once they realize they can play top tier games without spending hundreds on hardware, I expect people to start streaming more and more as tech gets more advanced. PSNow is a good example.

I love creating stories with my sims and even when I do challenges like NSB and all that I still create story that could be unique to other challenges you would see which is fun. I do love creative writing (I mean it's my minor in college) so I guess that's part of the reason why I like to create stories through my sims, however at the current moment I'm starting a SimLit legacy story soon, just trying to plan out what direction I want to take it.

It is massively, massively overblown because servers and the delivery of the data is commoditized. The infrastructure is there to be shared. Big tech companies don't build their server farms so they can keep it all for themselves. There are a huge number of suppliers and I wouldn't be surprised if Sony could use Google servers to delivery PlayStation Now, or MS Azure for that matter, or AWS. To take another example, of Sony themselves and their camera sensors division, the sell their sensors to nearly every manufacturer of smartphones out there and are the dominant player in that role, but their own smartphone division sucks, and could be considered a massive flop. Content and branding will always be more important in the game streaming business than the infrastructure because no server company owns also the delivery channels, namely, the copper pipes and fibre cables going into people's homes. These are subject to different factors and with net neutrality going out the window, the backend infrastructure plays an even more minor role. Another fact is, with Sony owning many patents pertaining to game streaming, through their purchases of onlive and gaikai, it wouldn't surprise me if Google and/or ms would have to pay Sony in some form and licence some tech. I may be wrong here, because I haven't looked into it fully, but my point stands that Sony are not lacking in any major department when it comes to streaming. They are extremely well positioned, and it is silly to discount Or discredit them. I mean, they are the only ones currently with a streaming service on the market, and it's making money and gaining subscribers today. And it's not like Google don't have their share of high-profile failures, Google+, pixel Slate, Google wave, just to name a few. Streaming may be the future, but my point here is that if that eventuality does come to pass, Sony will be playing that game, I can assure you, and they will still be big, perhaps the biggest.",,CJY,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

183604477604,3/21/2019,http://asadiwebnet.tumblr.com/post/183604477604,"During the GDC 2019 a Google conference took place. On it , the Google Stadia service was presented , consisting of streaming the image from games to the browser window. A moment later, Phil Spencer sent an email to the employees, calming down the Microsoft team. The content of this message went to the web. 


 At first glance, Google Stadia impresses. However, I am not convinced about this service . Image streaming is a reliable technology that depends on the network infrastructure of a specific recipient. Not only the speed of its connection, but also delays and distances from the server room. At most moderate successes of such initiatives as OnLive, PlayStation Now or GeForce Now show that streaming games in the quality corresponding to demanding players is a song of the distant future. This future is also at the center of Microsoft’s interest. 



 It’s no secret that Microsoft is working on its own game streaming service. 

 Google Stadia was like Phil Spencer’s nose. Alphabet overtook Microsoft, using the GDC 2019 event to show the world its latest product. No wonder that MS employees could feel uncomfortable. After all, a competitive technology leader praises the world for something they have been working on for many years. Phil Spencer decided to dominate the situation, adding the team’s own e-mail animations. Its content has been sent to the Internet (editorial translation): 

 Our team at GDC just finished watching the Stadia presentation. The show of competition is a confirmation of the rightness of the direction we took ourselves two years ago. The new rival from the tech area entered the competition for the gaming market. His presentation was not surprising, but I’m still impressed by the use of YouTube, Google Assistant and WiFi controller . 

 Returning, however, to us - hard work has meant that we actively participate in the competition for 2 billion players scattered around the entire planet. Today belonged to Google. But in a few months will be our day. We will be great during E3. We must continue to work on the service, with the user always in the center. We have content, we have a community, we have a cloud and we have a strategy. As always, I repeat: everything depends on the level of implementation. Today, implementation is more important than ever before. 

 We are wondering if the Phil Spencer’s e-mail was “leaked” deliberately. 

 The correspondence of the head of the Xbox is not something that regularly flows to the Internet. The leak is very convenient for Microsoft because it moves the reader’s attention from Google Stadia to the upcoming solution from the Xbox camp. Thanks to the corporate e-mail, we know that streaming games will be one of the most important points of Microsoft’s conference at E3 2019. We may also get the impression that Phil Spencer cares about the quality of the service at a higher level than the competition. 

 There is no doubt that MS is not overly satisfied with the new player in the race for streaming games. A similar position probably also dominates in Sony, where streaming has been actively developed for many years, in the form of PlayStation Now. Google Stadia is a foreign element that can disrupt the traditional course of competition for the player and his wallet. That’s why I will not be surprised if the expansion of PlayStation Now into new markets will be faster than ever before, and Microsoft will take great hits at its own conference.

With ms & google announcing their game streaming intentions, that basically left amazon as the only option in town. There is nothing else that comes remotely close to the infrastructure available to those 3, and sony doesn't have anywhere near the cash required to build one of equal potential. Would sony partner with amazon? Maybe. Sony has a history of not working well with other companies, but in this case it is more about using amazon services than an actual partnership, which is what netflix does. I really don't think psnow counts next to xcloud & stadia, it is fine for certain games, but any thing that requires great input response or online multiplayer is out of the question. That being said, even with superior infrastructure, it will be interesting to see how ms & google do when they finally release, and how close to the hype it is in the real world. I think for some people with specific circumstances, it might be a great way to play games but the quality will not be the best way to play. I think microsoft has it right with gamepass where you can download games. Sure you have to wait for them to download, and it's not an easy thing to play on public transit, but the benefit from doing so is huge. I laugh at all the current 4k streaming content, because it is not the purest uncompressed 4k quality, and that's movies. Games are a much bigger challenge and 4k will have to be cutting corners in image quality for transmission. I REALLY laughed at googles claim stadia will do 8k eventually.... Anyways, with everything seeming to be saying that streaming will be the way of things in the future, I thought sony was screwed. Then a few months ago it hit me that, maybe they aren't? Look at sony's biggest games and exclusives, they tend to be single player and from a studio they own. People playing online shooters and fighting games are also going to be way more interested in running the game on local hardware as any additional latency is unexceptable. So maybe sony doesn't need to be sweating the game streaming? Additionally, I worry more about xbox as ms seems really interested in streaming games to anything it can, possibly to the detriment of xbox hardware. Ms would be super okay with ps5 running xcloud, but I don't see sony ever going for it.",,thedoctorstatic,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Looks more likely to be competition for other distribution services. They need to rethink that controller too. It’ll be compatible with just about every controller they said so it doesn’t really matter. They also plan on launching on other platforms so maybe we’ll see this along with Xcloud on Switch. I don't get it. So this is like Steam? Or is the a subscription based service like XBGP and PSNow? It's a service where you play games by streaming, no need for a physical console. Conceptually, it's interesting, however most people don't have the internet to play games by streaming at a reasonable quality, hence why stuff like RE7 Switch never left Japan. And as others have said, this is direct competition to PSNow or other game streaming services, Switch still has the Nintendo titles that no other companies provide, that's basically it's niche",,Zabie_W,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

No, but you could become yogurt... ====================::==================== Streaming movies has meant more revenue, not less. You can't lend a streamed movie unlike disks. So comparing that to games, a $70, 50 hour game won't be covered with a steaming service as you say, but it also won't be lent, and could see a few months worth of subscribing. It won't be lent, so everyone wanting to play will have to pay. And the average retail price of a disc game is far, far below the launch day price, so it's not a $70 comparison. PSNow started in 2014. That's 4 years of data, and it's shown Sony that PSNow is worth increasing, not giving up on. The main issue with streaming services is the quality. As long as they are an option and don't displace game sales, I see nothing wrong with them.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,poprockz12,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

Most people who want to play Assassin’s God of War 2018 can already buy a PlayStation. But that said: It is ridiculous how many comments I read these days spouting that it’s “impossible to ever work” or “the rate people would have to get used to it is ridiculous”. I know there’s a rate of disbelief among gamers thanks to mocked up E3 trailers, but this has already been trialed by many people. Real, live people; like me. The preface of the entire argument is that the stream is fast enough that you can barely even tell it’s streaming externally. Hell, even *mouse movements on the menu* respond in a way that kind of feels snappy. If a streaming experience is not delivering that, nobody should really even bother considering the tech. But that’s not what I’ve seen off GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, or Google’s streaming beta. So please stop arguing that “it can’t work” if you haven’t tried it yourself. There’s even a free beta for GeForce Now you can request access to, to see if I’m wrong (reliant on a good internet connection)",,Katana314,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

But what do you expect/predict they'll do when it comes to streaming next gen(for Nintendo uproarious laughter is a valid response)? Google might have some sort of box but that's up in the air, could just be a service, like what xCloud might be, maybe? Amazon are probably working on something streaming based: because they've weren't adding enough fuel to GameStop's funeral pyre. Nvidia are still working away on something are far as I can tell. But what are your predictions, wild dreams and bare minimum expectations for our terrifying disc-less future where we have ever less control over what we actaully own and have rights to as consumers * looks for brown paper bag for hyperventilating into * Personally I think Mircosoft, Amazon and Google will go all in on streaming competing for the game everything anywhere market. Nintendo will continue to do Nintendo shit and make enough money to fuel a small country purely off of Pokemon-hardware-bundle sales. And Sony will offer a streaming service but i'll be less robust than the other options being focused on streaming to a console or TV while still selling a box(mid-tier PC) for premium gaming experiences. Basically MS, Amazon and Google all want to become the Netflix/Hulu/etc. for games, Sony wants to be the entire box office film industry turning a profit (just no Super Normal Profits) on AAA/Blockbusters and indie experiences best had as we currently do and Nintendo will keep selling Labos with DIY covers out of the back of a sedan at a flee market. ====================::==================== basicallyolly marked this as the best answer I think in general if other mediums are a sign, the way to play games will be broader but most ways will still exist. You can still buy movies and albums on discs, or download them. Despite the fact that both have very robust streaming options. As for who will win, I think the only thing that matters there is who can offer the best value for a monthly fee. If one of them manages to find that sweet spot between having relatively new games on their service without the service costing an arm and a leg. Whoever that may be is hard to predict. If the streaming services for the big consoles are just a complimentary way of playing some old games or less popular not-so-old games then I doubt it will push the needle much for anyone. Having only tried PSnow, it's fascinating on some level but the available games doesn't make me feel like it's even remotely a must-have. I might keep it around post trial period if only as a way of having access to odd games I would otherwise never buy. But that also in some ways feel like I am throwing money at Sony for a service that would in practice feel like I am paying for demos since I am not going to be invested enough in any game to actually spend quality time with them. That may also very well be my overall worry with a streaming future, that all games will feel less valuble and you end up jumping around and never sticking with any one game since you're getting that Netflix too-many-options stress and never commit to anything.",,Pezen,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Who Will Win The Streaming Wars?,,,

1. Google Stadia: Here’s the good, the bad, and the questions



Google’s fantastic sounding launch of Google Stadia, shifting gaming to the cloud, was as genuinely exciting as it was disappointing. Let me explain!

First, the details:

 * Google Stadia is the name of Google’s game streaming service, which first debuted as a test called Project Stream. 
 * Now players can jump straight into a game with a single click – even from a YouTube video or embed on a website, without installs or hardware. It just works, and within five seconds, according to Google. 
 * Using Google’s state of the art network infrastructure, the company is promising seamless streaming, providing you have a good enough connection – more on that below. 
 * Stadia is designed to be available everywhere: the cloud-based service works seamlessly on a Chrome browser, as well as Chromecast Ultra devices. That means both desktops, laptops, and phones with Chrome, can instantly stream a game and start playing. 
 * No install, no patches, no downloads – just fire up the Stadia service, and games will be available, if you’re on a fast enough connection to handle the data requirements. 60FPS, 4K, and Googles hope to stretch to 8K, 120fps streaming in time. That’s crazy. 
 * You can switch devices within seconds, going from playing on your TV to your phone rapidly, for on the go gaming. 
 * There’s a Google controller which connects directly to a data center, or you can BYO favorite Xbox, PS4, or Switch controller too. 
 * This is for AAA games – one of the first will be Doom Eternal, from id Software. 
 * It will launch in 2019 in the US, Canada, UK, and most of Europe. Google has been working on it for years, going back as far as 2014. 
 * We don’t know much else about how the platform will work when it comes to pricing. On-going subscription costs, plus purchasing of premium titles? 
 * Google says it will share more about Stadia “this summer,” which we imagine means Stadia will have a big presence at E3 2019. 
 * There are loads more technical details (The Verge) too, including performance info and new GPU chip from AMD. Google suggests that input latency might even be low enough for FPS games, although that’s a bold claim. 
 * Can and will PC gamers now just game on any device? Will this kill the need for high-spec PCs and laptops for casual gamers and others? 
 * How soon will this kind of service – if not Stadia, than a competitor – make buying a $400 console (plus the games) no longer make sense? Being offline isn’t really an option for any game, anymore, including single player. 
Questions:

 * Stadia is an exciting proposition: play games anywhere, from any platform that has a Google Chrome browser which is just about every device you own, including directly on your TV via Chromecast, is massive. 
 * The idea of having brilliant performance available without upfront cost for a gaming PC or console, available anywhere you go, is superb. 
 * Though, of course, there are reasons to be skeptical. 
 * Until we all see this working for us, it’s hard to really know how it will perform. What kind of DSL/Cable connection is sufficient? Do we need to wait for 5G? 
 * Putting game clients and multiplayer servers in one place seems like it will work to reduce latency, but the speed of light remains fixed. 
 * A large proportion of gamers aren’t worried about input lag and competitive edge, and don’t even know it really exists – and those that are. 
Content:

 * The bigger problem is that Google doesn’t yet have the content. As Google’s announcement went on, our Slack channel lit up talking about the details and the lack of games announced. 
 * Instead we saw Google offer technical demonstrations, pitching to the developers at its developer conference rather than the wider audience. 
 * If Google was able to announce a single blockbuster game – Fortnite, PUBG, or Apex Legends, or something like Red Dead Redemption 2 on any platform, as my colleague Joe Hindy typed, that would’ve become a trending topic on Twitter that stayed there for three days. Doom Eternal was announced, but with no detail given, it didn’t have much pull. 
 * Instead, we saw Google pitch to encourage people to create for their platform. 
 * We saw game publishers id Software and Ubisoft involved, and two of the most popular game development engines, including Unreal and Unity, are supported. That’s encouraging from the get-go, but necessary as well. 
 * Stadia will live or die on content, and we don’t yet really know how it will convince existing publishers and game houses to join its platform. 
 * Scale counts, which Google mentioned, but its competitors that already have the games and IP are working on their own service. Epic is all-in on its own game store and Fortnite is its portal towards streaming gaming. (Imagine getting into a game of Fortnite within seconds, no install, no updates) 
 * Sony is notorious for never giving an inch and already has PlayStation Now, Microsoft is working on streaming via Project xCloud, Amazon is working on its own service, Geforce Now is good right now, and many more, as we’ve discussed previously. 
 * So how does Google get the big games it needs for Stadia to really, really matter? 
 * Google is starting its own game studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment, to produce its own titles, with people like Jade Redmond involved. 
 * But the memes have already started about a lack of games. 
 * And many wondered if this would become another Google product to launch and disappear within a few years, as so many of its products do. (Here are 50 examples.) 
 * And asking around my friends who are fringe gamers or not really into the tech scene, Stadia didn’t cross over into their consciousness – which Google may not mind just yet, given it has the reach to do so when it wants. Until it launches, that might not be necessary, as long as it gets publishers and developers on board. 
Bonus: Google did pay a nice tribute to the Konami code with its controller. Type in the code () to the stadia.com website for a surprise.

2. Big breaking news: The EU has fined Google €1.49 billion for “abusive practices in online advertising” (EU): “Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites. This is illegal under EU anti-true rules … The misconduct lasted over 10 years.”

3. Disney moves from behemoth to colossus with the closing of 21st Century Fox deal, for $71.3 billion (NY Times). A Hollywood monster rises.

4. Apple released an iMac refresh for both its 4K and 5K models. That’s useful if you really wanted an iMac, but Apple leaving a completely outdated 5400RPM HDD as the default is terrible (MacRumors). If you’re going to buy one, you absolutely must pay $200 for an SSD upgrade. Also, expect more Apple device updates this week.

5. Apple’s MacBook ‘Flexgate’ is real, and Apple should acknowledge it (The Verge).

6. Dell XPS 13 2019 review (CNET): “It’s finally happened. With the 2019 revision, I’ve finally run out things to complain about…”

7. Samsung Galaxy A50 review: Samsung’s best mid-ranger in years (AA).

8. NVIDIA AI turns crude doodles into photorealistic landscapes (Engadget).

9. Collecting samples from Asteroid Bennu may be harder than NASA realized, new findings suggest (Gizmodo).

10. Here’s a “brief, scientific guide” to the first day of spring (Vox).

11. If a body rejects an organ transplant, can that organ be used for someone else, or is it no longer usable? (r/askscience).

That’s the seemingly-revolutionary promise of Google Stadia, the search and phone giant’s game streaming play for the hearts and minds of gamers. But, in spite of its apparent game-changing technological advances, Stadia as a concept has existed long before Google ever showed an interest in the space.

Game streaming is an area of gaming filled with lofty promises and missed expectations, but built on genuinely exciting principles. Google’s Stadia, revealed at GDC 2019, appears set to right the wrongs of many of its predecessors. But for Google and its heir apparent platform to manage that, the company will first have to have understood where its new platform’s ancestors fell.

 * First look: Stadia controller
 * Hands on: Google Stadia review
 * Why Google Stadia could spell trouble for the PS5 and Xbox Two


OnLive: the gaming giant that could have been

Readers of a certain vintage can cast their minds back 10 years to a very different GDC. Batman: Arkham Asylum and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 were the must-play games of the year, and the Nintendo Wii was still a marvel with its motion controls. But the games industry was about to get a surprise that would only  begin to resonate nearly a decade later: the reveal of OnLive.

Despite the limitations of broadband connectivity at the time, OnLive, somewhat magically, actually worked.

OnLive was a cloud gaming service that used remote servers to render AAA games, beaming playable video streams back to gamers in their homes without the need of expensive consoles or PCs. If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s the exact same principle that Google Stadia is built upon.

With servers around the globe, OnLive offered a reasonable catalogue of games to users for either a one-off fee or (eventually) as part of a per-month subscription package.

Despite the limitations of broadband connectivity at the time, OnLive – somewhat magically – actually worked. Users could log into the service via either a desktop client, mobile app or inexpensive microconsole (complete with unique control pad) and be presented with a 720p stream of AAA titles, including the aforementioned Arkham Asylum. 

Input lag and latency were indeed present, and fluctuated dependent on a user’s distance from the OnLive servers as well as the quality and consistency of their broadband connection. But it was, for many of those that took the plunge with OnLive, an acceptable experience – one that would even introduce now-standard features of the gaming community beyond just game streaming, like the ability to broadcast and spectate other users’ play-in-progress.



Some analysts stated that OnLive at its height was worth as much as $1.8 billion (a sum primarily based around the technology OnLive was built on rather than its userbase, which was never really established or maintained beyond an early, short-lived spike in interest). The service eventually sold for just $4.8 million.

So what went wrong? Why did it never grow a substantial playerbase? Reports of mismanagement were rife. CEO Steve Perlman was by all accounts a genius, having previously created QuickTime and WebTV. But he failed to secure a growing catalogue of games to entice users, and apparently had fits of rage that resulted in partnerships being pulled when he found out developers were cutting deals with his rivals.

From a technical standpoint, too, the world simply wasn’t ready for OnLive. The average broadband connection in OnLive’s key markets didn’t have the consistent speeds required for a smooth experience at all times, and input lag prevented players from enjoying high-speed action games. 

Gaikai and the roots of PlayStation Now

OnLive would be completely defunct by April 2015, with Sony picking up its patents. Previously in 2012, Sony had also acquired Gaikai, OnLive’s key rival, which lowered the barrier to entry with streaming games by offering streamed demos without requiring an online registration. Once a demo was complete, a player could then purchase the game in its entirety and continue playing. Websites could even embed the streams and take a cut of marketing revenue generated.

Gaikai would be the key to some of the most interesting aspects of Sony’s PlayStation 4 plans – elements that, in their own way, were important milestones for game streaming. 

As with the PS3, gamers would be able to stream their gaming sessions to a Playstation Vita console over a home network, but with a far more enjoyable experience thanks to newer hardware and Gaikai’s technical knowhow. 

More revolutionary was the concept of “Share Play”, using streaming tech to let a remote players join a ‘local co-op’ title over the web, as if they were in the same room together. You could even pass control of a single player game over to a remotely-located play using a streaming feed, letting them walk you through a difficult portion of a game.



Together, Gaikai and OnLive’s combined technologies would form the backbone of PlayStation Now, Sony’s own take on a game streaming subscription catalogue. Revealed at CES 2014, it was Sony’s workaround for supporting games on the previous generations of consoles, as the PS4 did not support backwards compatibility. 

It also offered a PC client – a way to play otherwise-exclusive PS4 titles like Bloodborne on a computer. Somewhere in the region of 600 games are now playable for a monthly fee in this way, with PS4 games having now eventually made their way to the service too. 

However, whether in response to Microsoft’s competitive Xbox Games Pass download subscription service or an admission that PlayStation Now’s streams also suffered from latency and streaming quality problems, PlayStation Now would also eventually add download options for select titles, which was a certified way to ensure smooth (if not instantaneously-accessible) play.

Current rivals and future hopefuls

Other household names of gaming have made similar attempts to make gaming more accessible through streaming. 

Steam offered its In-Home Streaming service to gamers, letting them beam the video from their core, high end PC, to any other lower-powered PC (or Steam Link accessory) in another room. In effect, you could bring that high-end PC gaming experience to your living room over a low-powered laptop without having to move your huge rig around the house. Its latest evolution is Steam Link Anywhere, which brings mobile play into the mix.

Google may be an innovator with Stadia then, but it’s far from being an originator.

Nvidia’s GRID system, introduced in 2008, is specifically designed to support cloud gaming systems. It would eventually become the backbone of its GeForce Now service, which has offered multiple services, from using a home computer to straem to a cloud-based subscription service to its latest iteration, which offers users access to a remote virtual computer from which to rent and stream a huge variety of PC games. 



If Steam, Nvidia and PlayStation are Stadia’s existing competition beyond the console space, what’s awaiting it in the wings? Microsoft’s nascent Project xCloud. 

It will leverage Microsoft’s Azure cloud data centers and the Xbox back catalogue to bring cloud-streamed games to any device with a screen – including mobile devices, where Microsoft is working to develop an unobtrusive touchscreen interface for playing on the go when a Bluetooth controller isn’t handy. There’s no word on an official service yet using Project xCloud, with it remaining very much in development. But don’t be surprised if it proves to be a large part of the Xbox Two experience.

Ultimately, Google may be an innovator with Stadia, but it’s far from an originator. Game streaming’s history is long and storied, and Stadia’s competition already exists, with services that are already breaking down the traditional concepts of console and game ownership. Google Stadia appears to be making all the right moves for its service to be a success, but it faces all the same challenges that have plagued its predecessors: it must have a strong game library; it must minimise input lag; it must be capable of delivering an enjoyable experience across middling broadband connections. And only some of those challenges are within Google’s power to influence or control.

183587089862,3/19/2019,http://time-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183587089862,"Google has officially announced a major new effort in the video game world — and it might just change the future of the roughly $135 billion industry.

Speaking at the annual Games Development Conference (GDC) in San Francisco on Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai unveiled Stadia, a long-rumored cloud-based games streaming service. Unlike with a traditional video game console or computer, which processes a game locally as it’s being played, Stadia games are processed in the cloud, with the action beamed instantaneously to players over the Internet. Google promises a lag-free experience, as long as you have a fast enough Internet connection.

“We are starting our next big challenge: building a game platform for everyone,” Pichai said. “I think we can change the game by bringing together the power and creativity of the entire community, people who love to play games, people who love to watch games, and people who love to build games.”

Launching sometime later this year, Stadia gamers play on devices they already own, with controllers they already own (though Google also announced its own Stadia controller). “There is no box,” Google Vice President Phil Harrison, a former Sony and Microsoft executive, said. “The data center is your platform.”

Google and partners made it clear that, with Stadia, Google is doing more than simply testing the deep waters of the video game industry. Rather, Stadia is a full-bore effort to fully compete in the industry in four big ways. With Stadia, Google is openly competing as a platform against the industry’s largest players: Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Thanks to close integration with Google’s YouTube, Stadia will also compete against massive streaming services like Twitch. It will go up against enormous games distribution juggernauts like Steam and the upstart Epic Games Store. Finally, the announcement of a new first party game studio potentially puts them in competition with other large publishers like EA and Activision Blizzard. And even if it fails, Stadia will most likely change the video game industry forever.

Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and now Google

Stadia’s biggest impact will depend on how the largest console makers — Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo — will react to Stadia’s presence. The streaming service comes at a pivotal time in gaming. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are thought to be in their waning months as rumors and confirmations have swirled for the past year about the consoles’ official successors.

One facet that Google harped on over and over again for Stadia was its flexibility as a platform. It promised that it could grow with the changing times. When Google initiated Project Stream, which offered a limited number of players access to Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey through its Chrome browser on the day of the game’s launch, it said that it streamed the game at a resolution of up to 1080p and up to 60 frames per second. During Tuesday’s presentation, Google Vice President Majd Bakar said that Stadia, at launch, will support up to a 4K resolution, eventually with capabilities to output up to 8K and 120 frames a second.

Google said the disconnected nature of Stadia allows it to upgrade over time at the server level, rather than users needing to upgrade their own box. “We have built our platform to scale up with the infrastructure,” Bakar said.

Additionally, since the games will live on Google infrastructure, rather than individual home consoles, Harrison said that there wouldn’t be a need for downloads, updates or patches with the games on Stadia. “We wanted to reduce the friction between getting excited about a game and playing a game,” he said. “With Stadia, this waiting game will be a thing of the past.”

Sony’s CEO Kenichiro Yoshida and Xbox boss Phil Spencer have said that both companies are working on hardware for the future, which many believe will be released next year. The possible features of both boxes remain largely unknown, but if they lack the possibility of experiences like Stadia, Google may have already leapfrogged the competition before the next console generation cycle even begins. (Of course, it remains unclear how many top-tier games will be available on Stadia, and gamers tend to go where the good games are.)

Sony and Microsoft each have released platforms that directly stream games to consumers from their respective consoles — Sony rolled out PlayStation Now in 2014 and Microsoft announced Project xCloud last October. It’s clear both companies have long seen the writing on the wall of the future of consoles, but it’s unclear how far out they have built an infrastructure that could support a console-less future. Google’s existing data infrastructure and expertise could give the company a big advantage here.

“If you think about it, there are a lot of barriers for users to play high-end games,” Pichai said. “Beautiful graphics really need high-end consoles or PCs. And games don’t have instant access.”

Targeting Twitch

Also in Google’s crosshairs: streaming services like Twitch. Google and partners showed off extensive integration between Stadia and YouTube. In one example, a viewer could be watching a stream of a multiplayer game, and join a live queue to play in the very same game as the streamer. 

The Stadia controller, which pairs with whatever device is streaming Stadia over Wi-Fi, also is tied in directly into YouTube, featuring a dedicated button that sends whatever you’re playing to your YouTube profile. 

Today’s presenters mentioned those who “love to watch games” as often as those who loved to play. It’s clear that Google has an eye out for the massive streaming market that has exploded in recent years.

Storming Steam’s Castle

The words “Stadia store” were only mentioned once by Harrison, without further elaboration, but it hinted that there would soon be a completely separate place from the traditional game marketplaces where players could buy their games.

Although Stadia games seem to be completely separate from the usual understanding of “PC games,” the fact that they will be playable on desktops and laptops appears likely to make this mysterious Stadia store a competitor to Steam.

Over the past several years, Steam has become a juggernaut for PC gamers and where the majority of games are purchased. That monopolistic hold over the medium was shaken late last year when Fortnite developer Epic Games announced the Epic Games Store, putting the most popular game in the world on it.

Stadia’s entry promises to turn the once-monolithic PC games market even more on its head. Google’s hefty presence has the possibility of upending how players think about PC games and where they are acquired.

Google the Games Developer

Finally, Tuesday’s announcement puts Google in competition with other game development and publishing studios. Harrison unveiled Stadia Games and Entertainment, describing it as “Google’s own first-party studio.”

Though the details were light, besides announcing its new head Jade Raymond, multiple game concepts designed in-house were shown. 

It seemed as though the studio would vie for partnerships with other development studios, but create plenty of its own games as well. That could turn Google into an AAA games studio in competition with the likes of Activision and EA. 

Win or lose, change is coming

Google’s presentation left an enormous number of questions unanswered, many of which Harrison promised to address this summer. Among the unknowns: Stadia will clearly require users to have speedy Internet connections, but access to high-speed broadband is unequal across the U.S. Google hasn’t announced a price for the service, either. And other companies (though none with the clout of Google) have tried and largely failed to offer a similar service.

Then there’s the matter of which games Stadia will offer. It’s a new platform, and developers haven’t had much time to create games for it yet. Id’s Doom Eternal and publisher/developer Ubisoft were mentioned during Google’s event, but gaming services can live or die on their launch titles. Still, Google’s decision to announce Stadia at the Game Developers Conference — to an audience largely made up of industry insiders and developers — was no doubt a strategic move to build excitement among the very people who will build the games that could potentially lift the platform to success. 

“Today, our industry captivates over 2 billion players from all around the world,” Harrison said. “At the center of that community, its beating heart, are the game developers. The people in this room who create the most incredible game experiences that delight players with engrossing stories, characters and worlds through a dazzling display of technology, artistry and magic.”

Even if Google’s Stadia isn’t an immediate hit, it could change gaming forever. By promising a game-streaming future, free from download times and the need for lots of local processing power, Google has set the bar even higher for what future gamers will expect. The promise of “instant access” is a hope for many gamers, and it’s exactly what Google says is coming. The largest players in the game industry were surely watching today. If they weren’t already hard at work on the diversity, flexibility and performance that Google has promised, they certainly are now.",,time-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"Stadia, Google's Big Push Into Video Games, Could Change Everything About How We Play",Post,,

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,sollus78,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

OnLive worked but was too expensive to run. Sony bought OnLive and shut it down. The successor from Sony is Playstation Now, which lets you access a remote Playstation. NVidia has something called GeForce Now, which lets you use a remote PC with, of course, an NVidia GEForce GPU. Currently in beta. It supports PC, Mac, and a TV interface, but not mobile. Probably because the games are unmodified and won't fit will on a small screen. Right now, GeForce Now is a free beta from NVidia. They kick users off after 4 hours so someone else gets a turn. No idea what real pricing will be. Google can afford to throw money at this, but it's not clear that the business will be profitable at an acceptable per-hour charge. However, it's probably more practical now than it was in 2010. Wait and see. Streaming might produce better visual quality than existing SL. SL has to load all those assets from the servers. If the client machines are in a data center which has copies of the assets, the clients can get them over fast links within the data center, not over a much slower remote link.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,crystalgem18,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

By having PlayStation now, they are clearly being their bets against every eventuality. PlayStation is a hugely important business to Sony and they probably aren't going anywhere. They will adjust their model when there is a necessity to do so. You may consider it too late by that point, but what do you really excited them to do other than come out with another handheld? Even Nintendo realise the writing is on the wall for dedicated handhelds, so why do you think it would significantly improve Sony's chance of survival to develop another one? Your post just sounds like unjustified Sony-hate really. Sony did extremely well this generation. Nurturing their game studios to make a number of them the best in the industry, moving to a whole new console architecture, one that will serve them well for another generation or two, investing in Vue and Now to bolster their streaming services, and their continued investment into VR, which is likely to prove fruitful in the long term. I'm sure there are many things could have done even better, but making a new handheld isn't it. And coming from where they were last Gen, they are sitting pretty. Competition is a good thing, I just Sony has what it takes to compete in the future.

The preservation of art allows important works to be revisited by and passed on to younger generations. If a single private entity had the ability to flip a switch and whisk away every Van Gogh painting, such that no human would ever see one again, most would find that completely outrageous. But that could be the future for video games, and not just for a single artist, but for virtually every game produced. Movies and music could go down this road as well, but those industries at least appear to have an interest in preserving past works, perhaps out of some amount of respect and reverence. This sentiment could not be convincingly attributed to the video game industry, as clearly evidenced by their behaviour with regard to the works that built their art form. *An important aside: When referencing the video game industry, I will be referring to large companies in the AAA and AA space unless otherwise specified.* It is not overly cynical to say that preservation of art is not a main priority for those who hold the publication rights of many beloved titles. With the sole rights to legally reproduce their games, many of which have had a significant cultural impact to now generations of people, most large publishers opt for one of three disappointing choices: 1. Sell even the most ancient games for the same price as new games on a digital store (Nintendo's typical approach). More galling is when years of fan pressure is needed to goad the rights-holders to basically just upload a small file, only to be charged an unfairly high, if not exploitative, price (see Earthbound for WiiU). 2. Publish an ""HD remake"", which while can be done right (see MGS collection), also has the risk of going horribly wrong and tarnishing other people's works of art (see Silent Hill collection). Either way, the extremely low ""development"" costs for most of these glorified up-rezzes does not justify, in my opinion, selling them for full market price (or above market price, as in Kingdom Hearts ps4 collection). 3. Offer no legal option to purchase the game other than buying a used copy, often for drastically inflated prices. Anyone who has visited a store specializing in classic video games knows that this is not an exaggeration; I've seen Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance on sale used for 200 CAD at a brick-and-mortar used game store. This abandonment is the end scenario for the vast majority of games that have been produced over the history of the games industry. It is a complete shame that many amazing games have been forgotten by their rights holders, with the remaining copies left to be desperately hoarded by fans or swapped between enthusiasts and speculators for exorbitant prices (akin to comic books, sadly). This situation will only worsen over time, as damage and technological obsolescence whittle away the finite supply of physical copies that remain, nigh certain to never be produced again. The following exercise in purchasing physical media elucidates the tragedy of video games better than I could every say with words: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is such a classic as to require no further explanation of its merits. The idea that anyone reading this has not seen this film for themselves is so upsetting to me that I refuse to consider that possibility any further. Released the same year was Cannonball Run 3, a massively panned film, which received 0 stars in a review from Roger Ebert and was nominated for three Golden Raspberry awards (including ""Worst Picture""). Some quick Google searches show that you can currently stream Indiana Jones on Netflix (9.99 a month for a basic subscription in Canada), purchase it new online from amazon.ca in a DVD collection pack for 37$ CAD, or on its own on BluRay for 25$ CAD. Cannonball Run 3 can be streamed exclusively from the depths of hell, or alternatively there is a single used copy available on amazon.ca for almost 100$ Canadian. Super Smash Bros. Melee for GameCube, released in December of 2001, is often touted as one of the best fighting games of all time. With a 92% on Metacritic and the adoration of casual fans and hardcore e-sports athletes the world over, Melee is essential to play in order to have a full understanding of the fighting genre and of video game history in general. Ten months after Melee exploded onto the scene as a system-seller for the GameCube, the Shrek video game was released upon innocent video game fans like an egg-fart in a crowded convention hall. Even though I'm using it to prove a point, I still wish I didn't remember it. The GameCube version got a 34% on Metacritic. It deserved worse. A used copy of Shrek for GameCube starts at 10$ CAD on amazon.ca. The lowest price you can expect to get for Melee is about 100$ CAD. As we can see in the above example, the adoration of critics and audience resulted in The Last Crusade receiving its just reward: Elevation to a solid piece of living history, continuously renewed for the convenient and affordable enjoyment for generations of film-goers. I could live for another hundred years, and still be able to get someone to pop on Indy 3 in my hospital room just before I pass into the sweet embrace of the abyss. And Cannonball Run 3, with a production company (Orion) behind it that was able to sink 18 million and probably would have liked to recoup its 14 million dollar losses with home release sales? It is now a complete rarity, receiving only limited re-production. This is a scenario that makes sense, and is beneficial for both businesses and consumers. Popular (or at least acceptable) films are successively offered on new formats by distributors at relatively stable prices between formats (decreasing in price over time within a format), making sales to new and returning consumers as a continuous return on their investment in the film; customers get a price that is competitive in a wide market of available films, and return customers get increasingly high fidelity editions of the film. Video game companies, as in the Melee example, more frequently opt to abandon the game to the used game market. Limited publishing leads to rarity for sought-after titles, which leads to demand, which results in inflated prices. Add it all up, and eventually we are left with stores stocking one copy of Melee for 100$, and five copies of Shrek for 10$. No plans have ever been made to re-release Melee (or the Shrek game for that matter) on physical or digital media, and knowing Nintendo, it is a good possibility it will never happen. Lost to the sands of time, never to return. What's that? No, I'm not crying, there's just something in my eye. It's the rain. I have aller- LEAVE ME ALONE! The video game industry, unlike the film industry, does not even pretend to care about the importance of their products as cultural artifacts. One could say that updated releases of classic films are just cynical corporations milking a cow for every possible drop of milk. But even that uncharitable interpretation is better than what we see from the video game industry. Publishers often refuse to revive classic games for public purchase, while simultaneously viciously attacking websites devoted to preserving games for emulation in ROM form; they want to not eat their cake, throw the cake on the ground, and stop you from scooping up a handful before the ants get to it. Digital sales seemed to solve this issue when they became widely available and popular last console generation. Sony's PSN store on PS3 with its ""PlayStation Classics"" was particularly pleasing; a large library of simple emulations of popular PSX and PS2 titles for reasonable prices, often much lower than what you would pay for a used copy of any given game (if you could even find one). Steam, deified at that time for its massive sales, was such a driving factor behind digital sales that it basically killed physical PC games as a concept. The main drawback of these digital stores is their use of DRM, which gives force to the hypothetical threat of legally revoking your license to access your games. Games you paid for, but didn't technically purchase an exclusive right to control at your own disposal (more on this later). And while a small number of digital stores don't use DRM (I can only think of gog.com), these stores as well as Steam have libraries that, though large, miss out on hundreds if not thousands of historically significant titles. So now we are proceeding from this already less than ideal situation into a future where not only do you not own your games, but they aren't even on your hard drive. Sony has decreased its number of classic titles available for individual sales, in favor of its ""PlayStation Now"" streaming service. Xbox will soon be selling a disc-less console that will primarily push its own streaming service. And now Google is jumping in with both feet by dropping Stadia on us, which will be an entirely streaming platform. The possible drawbacks to an all-streaming future are easy to imagine. You would have to accept, or even expect, your access to be interrupted or revoked for any number of possible reasons. Move to an area with an unexpectedly unstable internet connection? I hope you're renting, or you aren't going to be playing video games for a long time. Ubisoft ends its license with Stadia and moves to PlayStation Now? Hopefully the mega-corporations play nice and let you move over your save data for that 100 hour RPG you were in the middle of (****bursts out laughing****). But aside from the prospective practical annoyances, a stream-only future should be unsettling to anyone who sees video games as parts of our culture that are worth preserving. Films like The Great Dictator or Citizen Kane, or the music of The Ink Spots or Billie Holiday, have maintained cultural relevance as artworks for over 75 years due to the active efforts of rights holders to preserve the ability of new generations to go out and discover them. If you're in your late twenties or older, think of some of the titles from your formative years that grew your love of the art-form, the experiences that you dearly valued and identified with, the stories that changed how you see things and maybe helped you through some tough times. How many of those games are you confident that you would be able to go out and find today, physically or digitally, without either breaking the law or breaking the bank? Probably many, but what about in 10 years? 20 years? 75 years? In an all-streaming future, governed by those with a demonstrable lack of interest in preserving art, how would future generations have a chance of finding these games that are so critical to the development of an entire art-form? If you already have a significant library of games, you might think you could pass that on to the next generation. However, your physical games and consoles will continue to deteriorate over time, and will eventually become incompatible with modern televisions. Meanwhile, the industry has a vested interest in making sure you can't pass on or preserve your digital licenses, an interest that has been acted on in the past (recall that digital stores this console generation did not honour purchases made on the previous generation's store). I can predict with near certainty that while physical sales continue to be phased out, the major companies will also phase out digital licenses in favour of streaming; we are at the precipice of this scenario right now. Who knows whether the games you treasure will be selected for streaming availability? As I've argued previously, the video game industry does not seem to have the reverence that the consumer has for the history of the medium. Nothing lasts forever. Most of the works of art that have been produced in human history have been lost, destroyed, and forgotten. I am not against technological progress; quite the opposite in fact. The digital age has given us the opportunity to preserve and distribute art and entertainment with relative ease, and possibly for the rest of human history. Streaming content could be a major boon for the preservation of art, both practically and culturally. I can easily envision a future wherein there are no physical sales or end-user licenses for art and entertainment, while the public interest in preservation of art is still fulfilled. I propose the following: For decades after its release a work of art could make its profit from licensing to competing streaming services, after which it is placed in a publicly funded archive that can be streamed to the taxpayers for free (or perhaps a small donation). Works of art that are already publicly owned, unclaimed, donated by those not seeking profit, restored by historians, or recovered and donated, would be placed directly in that public archive. Exclusive rights to remake or remaster a product, or produce future works in a continuing brand or series, would still be held by the creator according to current copyright protections. To emphasize: The work and associated brands would be publicly available to **view** upon archival, but not yet open to the public to exploit for **profit**. The prospect of a digital museum to preserve public access to individual works has a clear benefit, preserving in culture works that could otherwise be jealously hoarded by rights-holders. This concept may not seem to add much benefit, as the internet has allowed the public to bypass corporate publication decisions for many years, through various legal and illegal file-sharing methods. But the crackdown on the free internet has begun. The public sites trying to preserve ROMs are under consistent attack, and will eventually buckle under the pressure. DRM will get more and more difficult to crack, while torrent sites continue to be hounded. Online piracy may never truly die, but I believe that the available file-sharing methods will continue to be eliminated and restricted, until only the most tenacious of technophiles are able to maintain their unfettered access to free information. I'm not unsympathetic to the financial needs of publishers and creators. Creators should have exclusive rights to profit off of their brands and works for a reasonable amount of time, as they do under copyright law in most modern countries. They also deserve the assurance that piracy of their content will be deemed illegal and discouraged by society. But it would be a mischaracterization to paint all those who pirate content as cheap parasites not wanting to pay for their share. I propose that some portion of the decision to pirate content is driven by a factor other than money: a desire to ensure their ability to enjoy digital content in the future. I don't think it is controversial to argue that people have a desire to keep things that they enjoy at their disposal for future enjoyment, and without further cost. Part of this behaviour also likely stems from our social nature; we have a deep desire to share that which we love with the people we care about, and full ownership of a thing gives us the expectation that we have this option in the future. Owning physical items usually allows us to have this expectation (with some exceptions, rental cars for example), but I would posit that for the savvy, digital licenses do not. Once one is aware that virtually all digital purchases do not give you the right to *own* one's favourite pieces of entertainment, they must then realize that instead they are being *allowed* to view it. *For now...* This realization could justifiably cause some anxiousness. I argue that this anxiousness, combined with a desire for the convenience of digital ownership, can influence a person to choose to pirate a copy of a product they would otherwise purchase (or have already purchased). As avenues of permanent ownership dry up with the ebbing away of physical media, this decision becomes the most desirable, if not also the only possible way to alleviate that anxiousness. End-user license purchases of digital products have gone under the radar for most consumers so far, preserving the expectation of future enjoyment mostly due to a lack of widespread lapses or revocations of licens",,ineedscissors,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) jumped on Tuesday after Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google unveiled its Stadia cloud gaming platform. The platform runs on Google Cloud and is powered by custom GPUs from AMD, giving the company a big data center win. Shares of AMD were up about 12.1% at market close.

So what

Stadia will allow users to stream games on a wide variety of devices, with the games themselves running on servers in Google’s data centers. The idea is to make graphically intensive games playable without expensive hardware like game consoles or high-end PC components.

Image source: AMD.

The custom GPU is based on AMD’s Vega architecture and provides 10.7 teraflops of raw computing power. That compares to 4.2 teraflops for the PlayStation 4 Pro and 6.0 teraflops for the Xbox One X, both of which are powered by older AMD hardware.

The Stadia service is expected to be available soon, although exact dates haven’t been announced. Pricing is still a mystery as well.

Now what

With demand for graphics cards slumping following the demise of the cryptocurrency bubble, AMD will need to grow its data center graphics business to compensate for weak gaming sales. This deal with Google will help the cause, although it’s too early to say whether it will be a success.

Streaming games requires a fast and stable internet connection. Any networking hiccup can cause lag or quality degradation, which is particularly bad for games that require quick reflexes. Game streaming services aren’t new: Sony offers PlayStation Now, and NVIDIA offers GeForce Now. Neither has upended the gaming industry so far.

Still, this is good news for AMD. The company needs to grow its presence in the data center to compete with NVIDIA, and Stadia is a good start.

Stadia is planned for launch this year and allows you to stream games across a variety of devices with very little friction. It could be a very big deal for gaming going forward. The platform aims to bring together playing, spectating, and developing games onto a single platform. As an example, you could view Assassin's Creed Odyssey on YouTube and then begin playing it through streaming in ""as little as five seconds."" Things like game updates and patches and system requirements are effectively a non-issue, because the game is running on Google's servers, rather than your local device. Google VP Phil Harrison promised the technology will work across desktops, laptops, TV, tablets, and phones. In a demonstration, the same demo was seen working across a Chromebook, smartphone, tablet, and TV, the latter through a Chromecast Ultra HDMI streamer. At launch it will stream in 4K at 60 FPS with surround sound and HDR support, and in the future Google is planning to support 8K resolution and frame-rates upwards of 120 FPS. Harrison also promised that the platform will embrace cross-platform play. You'll be able to use existing controllers on laptops and PCs, and Google will offer its own Stadia controller. The Google Stadia controller links to whichever device you're playing on, and it sports a dedicated Google Assistant button for referencing walkthrough videos if you get stuck. Gamespot .

183727689906,3/26/2019,http://bigbudget.tumblr.com/post/183727689906,"Apple has announced Apple Arcade, a new gaming subscription service for iOS, macOS, and tvOS. While details are currently thin on the ground, once Apple Arcade launches, it will let paying subscribers play over 100 titles across their Apple devices.

Mobile gaming is big business, and Apple has clearly noted how many people are willing to pay to play games on its devices. But why let developers make all of the money? Apple’s answer is Apple Arcade, a subscription service filled with exclusive titles.

Apple Arcade Kills Ads and In-App Purchases

Apple is billing Apple Arcade as “the world’s first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room”. Because unlike existing services such as PlayStation Now and Xbox Game Pass, Apple Arcade will work across multiple platforms.

Apple Arcade will be filled with new games from well-known names and companies. All of which will be exclusive to Apple Arcade. Subscribers will be able to download the games from the App Store, and play across their devices without ads or in-app purchases.



As if that wasn’t enough, all Apple Arcade games will be available to play offline, and many will offer support for controllers. You can also pick up where you left off in a game when switching between your iPhone or iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.

Apple’s Phil Schiller said, “The App Store is the world’s biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room.”

Apple Arcade Offers New and Exclusive Games

Apple Arcade will be launching in 150 countries in fall 2019. It will be available on iOS, macOS, and tvOS, and accessed via the App Store. Apple is currently working with developers on “100 new and exclusive games”. However, there’s no word yet on the price.

In case you missed it, Apple Arcade is just one of three new subscription services Apple has launched. The other two are Apple News+, which buys you access to hundreds of newspapers and magazines, and Apple TV+, which will be filled with original programming.

Hasn't this all been done before Yes but not well, Google is megacorp of the internet, if anyone can do this it's Google. Sony's PSNow service is descended from early attempts like Gaikai and OnLive but it's not that great a service, I've tested out PSNow quite a bit and found 60fps games work best but a lot of console titles are 30fps and feel really off even if the latency isn't an issue. Also visual quality is quite poor with whatever Sony is using for compression. Google is targeting 60fps and will likely deliver decent image quality, the WiFi controller is a clever addition too. The ability to market individual games across Android Play store and Youtube is very powerful. The downsides * More power for Google a company that has too much as it is. * Google controls everything over the service and can shut down any game it doesn't like, freezing anyone out from it. * This service demands a high speed connection,anyone with data caps should probably avoid it.",,Kato-2,United Kingdom,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,M,,,,Google unveils Stadia game streaming service,,,

They pay for bandwidth and rent machines from Amazon. Google owns the hardware directly and has been building it's own CDN for years now in a similar manner that Netflix took with it's CDN/OCA's. I see them going with a model closer to Playstation Now (which I don't pay near $100 a month for or hell, even for a year) rather then the model Parsec had to take. And even in that comparison, Google has leverage in it's own network infrastructure. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Stadia is going to be the new ""hot thing"" as there are some significant disadvantages to cloud gaming. Many of which you covered already, but I legitimately don't think price is going to be the significant issue. Since we got offtopic to move back to the OP, I don't think you have to worry about Steam going this route anytime in the near future.

I am trying to find it on PSN, but if I try to search through ""fighting games"", it is not there. If I try to search through the entire database on games starting with D...no DOD game comes up, WTF???? Seriously what the hell is that? It's completely ludicrous. So I try to do the next logical thing, the first step I took in this endeavor actually; searching by full name. I type in ""Dead..."" and a bunch of games starting with ""Dead"" in their title come up, so I continue ""Dead or..."" and ""The Virtual Orchestra"" and ""Everything"" and a bunch of other games come up with neither the words ""Dead"" nor the function ""or""...so that's neat. Anyway I continue typing ""Dead or Alive 5"" and I get ca. 9000+ results...which makes a lot of sense. I continue ""Dead or Alive 5 Last Round"", I get about 2000+ results, all seemingly pertaining to DoD5 LR or Ultimate for PS3. However, they are all costume/BGM type DLC's, and not the actual game or any version of the game...just DLC. So I scroll down and down and down into the veritable DOD DLC abyss until PSN shuts down because it cannot take the pressure of having 200-300+ DLC entries loaded while I keep diving deeper for what I am actually looking for. Do you guys get where I am coming from? This is legitimately insane. I cannot find the game anywhere...except for ebay.com. PSN officially sucks, and this is not the first time I have thought so. My God. Can anybody please explain to me what in the actual F is going on? I would like to know if anybody else can find it, the actual game because I have no god damned clue as to who I am anymore. And does the game really have 2000+ DLC's? And what's with those insane price tags? I know there are a lot of optional characters and costumes and BGM...but seriously if I bought all of that the game would ultimately have cost me like $1000++, which is sick, but I would probably end up buying some of it, however I cannot because the game itself, the core game is impossible to find. And it looks like DOD5 Ultimate for PS3 is locked behind PSNow, which is also disgusting. That's my rant.

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== EA is a joke... why would people pay a subscription for titles that require or expect even more cash in the game to be spent? The goal is to get you coming and going. Generate a regular revenue stream through the service while still trying to fleece people with in game purchases as well.",,BGAlum,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA Access could reportedly be on the way to PlayStation 4,,,

183469562734,3/15/2019,http://aresworld-universe.tumblr.com/post/183469562734,"Imagine a world where you don’t need expensive gaming hardware to play the next big release – a world where all you have to do is open the Chrome browser, pick out a game you want to play and instantly have it start without any need for a lengthy download or surprisingly large patch. 

That’s the idea of Google’s Project Stream cloud gaming service. 

Rather than needing high-end hardware, Project Stream allows you to use whatever computer you have around to play video games. Google handles all the heavy lifting on its own servers, which can process the latest version of the game at high resolutions and frame rates, encode it into a stream, and deliver the stream to you over the internet.

We got our first taste of the service during an extended beta that ran back in 2018, and now we’re set to see its evolution at GDC 2019 on March 19. Whether it remains in the browser or makes its way to a dedicated remains to be seen – but, based on what we played last year, Project Stream serves as an impressive showcase of what the future of cloud gaming could look like.

[Update: After a patent for a Google gaming controller went viral over the weekend, Google has opened up a teaser site for an unveiling event on March 19. Head over there now to sign up for alerts and more information about the service – or read up on the Nintendo Switch controller support fuelling speculation.]

How Project Stream works

It’s not clear how the final product will work, whether Google will maintain the Project Stream name, or even whether Google will continue the project after this beta. But, for the moment, as long as you’re connected to the internet with a fast and stable connection and you’re using a recent desktop version of the Chrome browser, you’ve got the setup needed to use Project Stream. 

Playing a video game on Project Stream is as simple as opening a new tab in Chrome and going to the Projectstream.google.com page.  

Google will prompt you to run a connection test that checks your internet bandwidth, the latency between your computer and the servers, and any data loss. Google requires a streaming rate of 15Mbps, latency below 40ms, and data loss below 5%. With these requirements met, you’ll be ready to dive into a game.

The beta of Project Stream is offering Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, which is nothing short of a demanding title. When you launch the game in your Chrome tab, it will go fullscreen, and run exactly as if it has been launched on a proper gaming computer (except without a deep graphics settings menu). You can play with a keyboard and mouse or connect a game controller and play that way.



All of your inputs on the computer get sent over to Google’s servers, processed in the game, and everything happening gets streamed right back to you. This is why that latency is so important, because you can’t have a good game experience if everything you do in the game shows up a second later.

The limits of Project Stream haven’t been detailed, but Google has shown off the service running at 1080p and 60fps, pretty much the bar for quality PC gaming. 

All of your inputs on the computer get sent over to Google’s servers, processed in the game, and everything happening gets streamed right back to you.

So, in effect, you’re opening a new tab that pipes all your inputs to a high-end gaming PC that streams back the visuals and audio to your computer screen. This system is simpler than some others, which set you up with a virtual desktop that then remotely runs Steam, Origin, Battle.net, or what have you.

In the case of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on Project Stream, you are still required to log into a Ubisoft account to play, but beta testers aren’t required to own the game.

It’s unclear at this point whether Google will require players to buy games and pay for the streaming service in separate transactions, or whether access to select games will be bundled into the service.

What games will be available on Project Stream?

Through the Project Stream beta, the only available game was Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. While this didn’t give us much idea of what games Google will offer in the future, it did give us a good idea of what games Google could be capable of offering. 

For a 1080p 30fps game experience at High settings in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Ubisoft recommends a system with the following specs:

 * OS: Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only)
 * Processor: AMD FX-8350 @ 4.0 GHz, Ryzen 5 - 1400, Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.5 GHz
 * Video: AMD Radeon R9 290 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 (4GB VRAM or more with Shader Model 5.0) or better
 * Memory: 8GB RAM
 * Video Preset: High
 * Storage: 46GB available hard drive space
 * DirectX: DirectX June 2010 Redistributable
 * Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card with latest drivers
For 4K at 30fps and high settings, the recommended specs bump up to include 16GB of RAM, a more powerful AMD Ryzen 1700X or Intel Core i7 7700 processor, and a beefier AMD Vega 64 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. With Project Stream shooting for 1080p at 60fps, the type of system it’s offering would fall somewhere between Ubisoft’s recommended specs.

The truth is a computer that can handle Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 1080p 60fps is going to be capable of playing a whole lot of games at these settings. Other major titles could easily see support on the service.

Games with a major online focus may have dicier prospects on Project Stream. Since competitive online games are often fast-paced and require split-second reaction times, the extra latency introduced by streaming will likely be an issue for serious competitors. That said, we don’t see these games being unplayable on the service.

A recent Chromium update also added support for Nintendo Switch controllers to Google’s browser, so it looks like we could be getting more than just streams of PC releases.



What’s Project Stream like to use?

At its best, Project Stream is good. At its worst, well, Google won’t let you play below a certain threshold of quality, and you wouldn’t want to anyway.

We tested Project Stream on varying setups. We played on an unstable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection, a fast and nearby 5GHz Wi-Fi connection, and on an ethernet connection held steady and offered high bandwidth. 

The highly dated Chromebook hardware didn’t hold it back from playing.

We also played on a 5-year-old Chromebook, a 2-year-old Razer Blade, and a modern desktop gaming rig that would be happy to run Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 1080p/60FPS on its own hardware. We even started one computer up while another was running the stream, and Google simply transferred control over to the second computer, with no stop in the stream.

Across the board, we’d describe the experience as at least playable. The highly dated Chromebook hardware didn’t hold it back from playing. The biggest issues come from a bad connection: if the connection speed drops, so does the game quality, with lower resolutions, latency, and far more noticeable compression. 

That said, in our experience, the visual degradation came before the latency, so we were able to continue battling enemies smoothly even if they started to look like ghostly swarms of pixels.

Overall, the graphics are fairly good throughout, especially when playing on a high-bandwidth connection using ethernet cables. Colors, shadows, and anti-aliasing look fine, and the frame-rate seems to vary between 30 and 60fps.



The low frame-rate was one of the two issues we noticed. The other was compression. Most of the time, it’s not super jarring, but when there’s a lot of detail in a scene and a lot of movement, the compression turns it all into a bit of slop. Character faces become a blur and hard edges (noticeably the character’s hair) go soft. 

It would seem to be a sign of the lower bitrate enabling this type of streaming, but the truth is that most of the time it’s unnoticeable, and would be even harder to spot if you weren’t looking for it (we were looking for it). Panning the camera and running through dense wooded areas in the game (and combining the two) were the only times we were turned off by the dips in visual quality.

The experience isn’t mind-blowing, at least until you remember that it’s using so little of your computers processing power that you’ve literally got a full-system virus scan going in the background and nothing changed. The visuals are comparable to what you’d get on a console, except with compression artifacts here and there. And, with a stable connection, it compares rather favorably to in-home streaming on a Steam Link.

While the price and service model Google adopts will go a long way in determining whether Project Stream is worthwhile, we can say right now that it works, and it looks good doing it. But, will Microsoft’s xCloud do it better?

I'm done wasting money on upgrading to new hardware to play the latest games if xCloud is as fast as Microsoft touts it's going to be with low latency and 5-10mb/s from their demos they ran. And after trying Sony’s crappy PlayStation Now streaming service with high latency, I’m not holding my breath for Sony to fix their horrible networks. I'm waiting for something new already, so hell with PS5 and Xbox Two. At least this is how I'm seeing it now hoping xCloud will be what it is playing the latest games and not stuck with this exclusive hardware BS of consoles.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,thadeeliv,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

It certainly had its fair share of problems at launch, but I feel like service today it is in a much better spot than it has ever been. I’m interested to see how it evolves over the coming months and years as its competitors join in the market.

183591601465,3/20/2019,http://engadget-in-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183591601465,"There’s a good chance we’ll remember Google’s Stadia announcement as a landmark moment in gaming. In one fell swoop, Google laid out its plans for an ambitious game streaming service that goes far beyond anything we’ve ever seen before. Stadia promises unparalleled graphical power, near-instant access and the ability to play the latest titles on almost any screen. As Google’s announcement went on, the future came into focus – a world where the frustration of modern consoles didn’t exist, and games flowed freely as water.

Obviously, plenty of questions still remain. We don’t know what Stadia will cost, or how well it’ll perform with millions of players slamming Google’s servers (the “Project Stream” beta was solid, at least). But after plenty of false starts in game streaming, Stadia feels like the bold swing that could make it truly take off. That might seem surprising, coming from a company that hasn’t has much experience with games. But historically many of the biggest shifts in the industry came from newcomers: Sony proved CDs were a viable upgrade to cartridges with the PlayStation; and Microsoft showed the importance of a robust online service with Xbox Live. Each of those companies tapped into their expertise to shift the gaming landscape, so it makes sense that Google would be the one to nail streaming. It requires a deep understanding of the internet and experience in delivering complex services to a wide variety of devices.

For years, streaming games over the internet has seemed like a pipe dream. OnLive made a huge splash a decade ago, only to burn out a few years later (Sony picked up its patent scraps). GaiKai was a direct competitor, which Sony snapped up and used its technology to build PlayStation Now and Remote Play. More recently, we’ve seen the likes of NVIDIA take a stab with GeForce Now – a solid service, but one that’s perpetually been in beta. There are also smaller companies, like Blade and Parsec, that are trying to make their mark. Microsoft, meanwhile, says it’s working on its own game streaming solution, Project xCloud, which we’re expecting more details about at E3.

While all of these services basically do the same thing (let you play titles running on remote servers over the internet), Stadia’s scope is on an entirely different level. Google says it’ll be powered by servers running custom CPUs and AMD GPUs capable of 10.7 teraflops, on par with NVIDIA’s GTX 1080 Ti. In comparison, the Xbox One X, the most powerful console today, has six teraflops. The company claims Stadia will support up to 4K HDR at 60 frames per second, something that only gaming PCs can achieve today. It’s also eyeing 8K 120+ FPS down the line, specs which no game supports today. To deal with more demanding games, Stadia will be able to use multiple servers and GPUs seamlessly. And it will also rely on server-class SSDs, which means your games and levels will load faster than any console. Basically, you won’t have to worry about specs anymore.

Of course, raw power doesn’t mean much if your gameplay is laggy because the servers are far away, but Google says it’ll have 7,500 server locations around the world. We haven’t seen server stats from earlier streaming services, but even OnLive at the height of its popularity couldn’t deploy data centers as easily Google. That’s also a sign that smaller companies like Blade and Parsec will have a hard time competing.

Google is also making its service a much more web-connected experience than consoles. Press a button on the new Stadia controller, and you’ll quickly start streaming your experience on YouTube gaming. Another button lets you access Google Assistant, which can automatically point you to YouTube videos to help you get through a tough level. Google says Stadia will also lead to lag-free multiplayer matches, since all of the networking complexity happens on its cloud. And there’s another surprising advantage: the service could also help us relive the days when we spent hours playing Goldeneye on crowded couches.. Many modern titles are too demanding to support co-operative multiplayer on a single TV, but that’s not problem for Stadia’s cloud processing.

The Stadia controller is unique in another respect: It connects to the internet over Wi-Fi, giving it direct communication with the server. That’s a smart way to reduce input lag, a common problem with every game streaming service so far. Previously, you’d press a button on a controller and it would go through a local device, make its way to a server, and you’d see the result when it appears on your screen.

Stadia appears to address most of the problems inherent with game streaming, while also offering significant advantages over today’s consoles. With its large server footprint and powerful hardware, Google says you’ll be able to start a game in under five seconds. You won’t have to worry about downloading, installing and updating anything. (I can’t count the number of times when I’ve had 30 minutes to play something, only to be thwarted by a huge update.) Its expandable graphics means it could scale to whatever quality you need. And of course, there’s no giant box to deal with – all you need is an internet connection and a device that runs Chrome. As Google demonstrated at GDC, you’ll be able to continue a single play session across multiple devices easily.

Perhaps most importantly, Google seems to be throwing everything it has behind Stadia, something we haven’t seen with a game streaming service since PlayOn. They’ve even hired industry veteran Jade Raymond to head up their first-party studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment. Hopefully, Stadia will encourage competitors like NVIDIA and Microsoft to step up with their own offerings. While there’s still plenty left up in the air, Stadia is the boldest play we’ve seen yet for the next generation of gaming.",,engadget-in-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Google's Stadia is the moonshot game streaming needs,Post,,

The industry's biggest players have made that decision and stepped up the enormous investment in technology and infrastructure required to make it into a reality. Sony's PlayStation Now has been slowly evolving in the background with fairly little fanfare; now Microsoft's xCloud has taken an important step forward with a live demo, supposedly a lead-in to public trials later this year. The other shoe whose dropping many pundits are eagerly anticipating belongs to Google, and that will hit the floor at GDC next week. The company has hinted at a gaming announcement more significant than anything it's done in the space so far -- hardware may be on the table but it's widely expected that a streaming service will be the main dish, with anything physical being in the form of controllers or streaming boxes to support the service. As the notion of a ""Netflix for Games"" service takes root, all of the major players are positioning themselves to make sure they get their slice of the pie.

Why the Future of Gaming Might Mean the End of Consoles





This article comes from Den of Geek UK. 

Just over a month ago, Sony’s PlayStation boss Shawn Layden suggested that the future of gaming could be “kind of a post-console world where you can have quality gaming experiences across a variety of technologies.” 

“Sure, PS4 and PS4 Pro provide what, of course, we think is the best gaming experience,” he added, “but the other consoles out there, be it [Nintendo] Switch, Xbox One X, or tablets, or phones – there are great experiences across all these. What we need to do is recognize all that. We’re not little gaming ghettos that are not federated or aligned at all. We’re all part of the same gaming community, we just come at it through different doorways. I think the future will be an extension of that metaphor. Your platform is not your hideaway. It’s just your doorway to all these other gamer folk.” 

In the month since Layden made that statement, a lot of evidence has emerged that seems to back up his claims that the lines might be blurring between PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox. Let’s have a look at the clues, then, and ponder what this post-console world could look like for the gamers and companies involved… 

More sharing between companies



Game companies are becoming more open to sharing their content than they were in the past. Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s Xbox boss, has provided a perfect example of this sharing-friendly new way of thinking. 

“We want to bring [Xbox] Game Pass to any device that somebody wants to play on,” Spencer told Geekwire in an interview, referring to the streaming service where gamers can pay a monthly fee to access an impressive library of Xbox 360 and Xbox One games. 

The service was originally only available on Xbox One, but rumors suggest that it could soon launch on Nintendo Switch. If Spencer really wants the service to appear on “any device that somebody wants to play on,” it seems safe to assume that the possibility of bringing the service to PlayStation consoles, mobile devices, and PC has at least been discussed at Microsoft. In fact, through the Play Anywhere initiative, there are already a select number of Xbox Game Pass games that you can play on Windows 10 PCs. 

Microsoft has also revealed that Xbox Live support is coming to mobile devices and there are rumors that the service might also appear on the Nintendo Switch, giving players access to achievements, their friends list, and Gamerscore on devices beyond the Xbox One. Developers will also be able to implement Xbox Live support into their games.  

The company has also just launched an update to its Wireless Display app that allows users to stream their PCs through an Xbox One. While this isn’t exactly a partnership between Xbox and PC platforms like Steam, this update has opened the door to streaming Steam games on Xbox One. What is a surprising partnership is Microsoft putting the PC port of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam. That’s a major step for Microsoft, which is hoping its flagship franchise to PC for the first time in more than a decade.  

Meanwhile, Sony’s own streaming service – PlayStation Now – already allows users to stream a library of PS2, PS3, and PS4 games on PC. The boundaries between the games you own and where you can play them seem to be gradually crumbling in a way that would have been difficult to imagine a few years ago. 

The end of the exclusive?



Although you do still see games companies producing exclusive titles (see: Marvel’s Spider-Man, God of War, Crackdown 3, Pokémon Sword and Shield), real progress has been made by Nintendo and Microsoft to bring their first-party titles to other platforms. While the latter company’s cross-platform endeavors have mostly entailed bringing its Xbox exclusives to Windows, another one of its platforms, the Japanese game publisher has truly made the leap. 

The Big N has already brought Pokemon, Super Mario, Fire Emblem, and Animal Crossing to mobile devices, and a new Mario Kart mobile game is also on the way. Bringing Nintendo properties to mobile in new and interesting ways (see: Pokemon Go) has opened new doors for the company, as it attempts to reach a whole new casual audience. 

Going forward, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched to imagine a world where exclusive games don’t stay exclusive forever and a time when a vast amount of older titles will be made available on devices that they didn’t originally launch on.  



Streaming games instead of sitting down with your console



Streaming, it seems, is the next great frontier for games companies. Whether you’re logging into PlayStation Now or Xbox Game Pass on a non-console device, playing PC games through your Xbox One, or remotely controlling your console from your phone (which is also something you can do right now in a lot of cases), the magic of the internet and online streaming is allowing games to bridge to gap between the systems they were made for and the ones that people currently have on hand. 

At the moment, there are limits on the sort of game that you can stream without encountering massive lag or breaking the internet. Older titles and smaller titles can work really well when streamed, but massive AAA games don’t always translate through the internet in the same way. But you can be sure that brainboxes are working behind the scenes to remedy that.  

Microsoft is working on an ominous-sounding initiative entitled Project xCloud, for example, which has the aim of creating a cloud-based streaming platform that can process huge games such as Halo without the need for a physical console in the room. Nobody seems to mind that hefty home consoles could go the way of the dodo as a result. 

“That is not where you make money,” Microsoft’s Phil Spencer said, on the topic of console sales, in that same Geekwire interview. “The business inside of games is really selling games […] So if you open it up, the more often people can play, the more they’re enjoying the art form. It increases the size of the business.” 

If the nut of lag-free streaming for major new games can be cracked, we could hypothetically live in a world where you don’t need to be anywhere near a console (or perhaps you won’t even need to own one at all) in order to play a new title. If your internet connection was strong enough, you could just log into your games membership thingy on whatever device you have handy and start playing from where you left off. 

Of course, there will always be situations when you’d rather play a game offline, so here’s hoping that the rise of game streaming doesn’t make the ability to download games a thing of the past. We can definitely see the physical disc going that way, though. 

Gaming on the go



In the same way that having Netflix on numerous devices has revolutionized the way we watch TV – allowing us to dip in and out of a binge whenever we get a spare minute – the possibility of fully functional AAA streaming and a greater amount of content-sharing between companies could mean that the way we play games majorly evolves in the next few years. 

Imagine a world where you can play the same game on your home TV, your phone, your laptop, or your tablet. As long as you have a strong enough internet connection, you could hypothetically stream that game anywhere. The flexibility of the Nintendo Switch – which allows you to play at home or on the god – could one day apply to all gaming.  

Many companies seem to be interested in game streaming and content sharing, both of which suggest a world where you don’t need to be with your home console in order to play home-console-sized games. This will be music to the ears of people who struggle to find the hours to play at home but would love to fire up an exciting new title when they’re away. Also, if the boundaries properly come down between devices and companies, gaming could start to seem like a less complicated pastime for newcomers to get involved with. 

What’s interesting, though, is that Sony and Microsoft are both developing next-generation consoles, despite all their interest in these new frontiers. It’ll be interesting to see how the PS5 and the Xbox Two (or whatever they end up being called) factor into these big ideas about how gaming can evolve… Are these next consoles the last ones we’ll ever have to buy? We’ll just have to wait and see to find out, but it is an interesting future to imagine.",,daddy-dallas,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Why the Future of Gaming Might Mean the End of Consoles,Post,,

To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior?

183495456896,3/16/2019,http://slimgigs.tumblr.com/post/183495456896,"Google is making a big play in gaming next week, but we’re still unsure exactly what that entails. For years, the company has toyed with the idea of getting involved in what is now the biggest sector of the entertainment industry, worth an estimated $138 billion dollars as of last fall. And it would make competitive sense: Amazon owns Twitch, Facebook acquired Oculus, and Microsoft has Xbox. The only other major tech company without a serious gaming platform or investment of its own, not counting mobile app stores, is Apple, although even the iPhone maker is now rumored to be working on a game subscription service of its own.

Google has always had many of the pieces required to challenge the likes of Sony and Nintendo. The Android operating system is the most-used mobile software on smartphones around the world, while the Chrome browser and Chromecast streaming platform have given the company an easy way to run applications in real time and access television sets. It’s not hard to imagine an Android or browser-based gaming service that can let you play advanced software on a living room TV. 

But, until now, all we’ve seen are a few strong hints to what Google might be building. That changes on Tuesday of next week, when Google plans to hold its first-ever keynote at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. There’s been a lot of news over the past few months that gives us a good idea at what’s to come, but whatever Google does announce, it could have a big impact on an industry that is transforming how it builds, distributes, and sells games. Here’s a rundown what we know so far and what we think might be coming next week. 




It’s highly likely it involves cloud gaming 

In teasing its GDC keynote, Google said it would unveil its “vision for the future of gaming.” And, going off numerous previous reports and public showings from the company itself, it’s highly likely the announcement involves a full-fledged cloud gaming service. More than a year ago, The Information first reported about Google’s Project Yeti, the codename for an internal division responsible for building a next-generation streaming service similar to existing but limited options like Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now. 

Even before Sony and Nvidia’s services existed, cloud gaming had been a bit like the industry’s holy grail: a just-out-of-reach ideal that has preoccupied a number of startups like OnLive, Gaikai, and others, but that’s never quite been cracked because the infrastructure and economics weren’t quite figured out. 

The concept is relatively simple. What if, like Netflix and Spotify, you could not only digitally distribute games, but also stream them over the internet, so players wouldn’t need expensive hardware to play graphically-intensive titles? It’s difficult because games, unlike other forms of media, are both incredibly large in size and require real-time input from players. But it is doable, by wiring up the necessary hardware in a data center, running the game on a remote machine, and sending the video and receiving player commands over the internet. 

Regardless, it’s been impressive how many additional companies have revealed cloud gaming services in the past few years, turning what was once a niche experimental effort in an industry-wide race to figure out the future. Microsoft has gone public with its own game streaming platform, xCloud, that it plans to start testing later this year. EA, after acquiring the rental and cloud gaming service GameFly, is now working on a product of its own called Project Atlas. Even Verizon is getting into the game, with a test service up and running on Nvidia Shield set-top boxes. Earlier this week, Valve expanded its Steam Link service to turn it into a personal cloud gaming app. Both Amazon and Nintendo are looking into the technology, too.

There’s been a number of obvious signs that Google is indeed working on the technology. Most prominently, Google launched its public test of Project Stream, an experimental game streaming technology that worked directly in its Chrome browser. Through a partnership with Ubisoft, Google let you play the brand-new Assassin’s Creed Odyssey — without needing to purchase the game — on pretty much any machine, given you had a strong enough internet connection. 

It was remarkable experiment, not just because it actually worked quite well, but also because a game studio as large as Ubisoft agreed to let one of its biggest launches of the year be a test subject. The test is now over, but it Google set out to gather data from what it considered a “technical test to solve some of the biggest challenges of streaming,” data that could help inform whatever product it announces next week. 

There’s also been a lot of strategic hires in the past 18 months or so that hint toward a large, legitimate push into the gaming sector. Phil Harrison, a long-time executive of both Sony and Microsoft’s Xbox team, joined Google last year as a general manager and vice president, but working in an disclosed capacity. At the time, it was believed Harrison was going to help Google build out its virtual and augmented reality platforms as viable gaming businesses. But Harrison was also on the board of game streaming company Gaikai, a company acquired by Sony in 2012 and instrumental to the launch of its PlayStation Now service. So it’s likely Harrison is helping Google in its similar efforts. 

Later in the year, Google hired Jack Buser, who was a senior director at Sony’s game streaming unit and led the PlayStation platform’s social efforts before that. Shortly after, Google also hired Sony senior research engineer Richard Marks, who helped build the PlayStation VR headset and Move controller. 

I’m excited to finally be able to share that I have joined Google as VP!

— Jade Raymond (@ibjade) March 12, 2019 

And just last week, gaming industry veteran Jade Raymond also joined Google as a vice president, though we don’t what team or division she’ll be leading. The timing may not be coincidental. Raymond, who was executive producer and co-creator of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed and later joined Electronic Arts, could be heading up some type of creative division at Google, or one responsible for developer outreach given her connections at big studios and publishers. 






There’s a hardware component, and it may involve Chromecast

We don’t have too much to go on regarding what this service might look like, but we do know that there’s a strong likelihood there is custom Google hardware involved. Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware and its senior vice president of devices, tweeted out a link to the GDC keynote earlier this week: 

Osterloh oversees Pixel phones, Google Home devices, and the myriad other hardware products the search giant now produces in-house. Whether that means we’re getting a Pixel-branded cloud gaming console or something else entirely is unclear. But it’s interesting nonetheless to see Osterloh involved in some way. Kotaku’s Jason Schreier, who corroborated many of the initial details about Google’s upcoming service last summer, also reported that hardware will be one of three big components to the service, the other two being streaming and a massive in-house developer division that sounds very much like what Raymond could be involved in. 

If we had to speculate on what exactly a Google game-streaming platform look like, we don’t have to look too hard. That’s because it could very well already exist, at least in part, as Chromecast. Google’s streaming dongle is already capable of letting you play Android games on your TV using screen mirroring from a compatible smartphone.

Now, that’s not to say that this new game streaming platform will just piggyback off Chromecast. But Chromecast does provide a model for how Google will go about delivering gaming experiences to a TV. For one, it’s a no-frills package that plugs in through one port and stays out of the way. And because cloud gaming, like media streaming, doesn’t require a ton of local processing power, the hardware can be lightweight and cheap. Given the amount of buzz Google is creating here though, it seems more likely it’ll drop all-new hardware specifically for gaming. 

There could be a game controller to go with it

You can’t have console-quality gaming (if that is indeed what Google is going for) without some type of peripheral. For Google, that means building your own controller. According to a patent revealed late last week, that might be exactly what the company has done, with images showing off a Google-branded gamepad that like a cross between a PlayStation controller and the ill-fated Ouya’s gamepad from a half-decade ago. 






This, even if Google doesn’t produce an actual console, might be why Osterloh’s hardware division is involved. For one, if Microsoft and Sony are building competing services, Google might not want its customers using other companies’ controllers. 

And it’s a no-brainer that a service of this type would need to be first-and-foremost a controller-centric experience. As it stands right now, any kind of cloud gaming service is probably going to have at least some issues with connectivity. The bar for console game performance is much lower than on PC, where competitive games require the best connections possible and even milliseconds of latency matter to hardcore players. 

In other words, this probably isn’t going to launch as a mouse-and-keyboard experience, at least not at first. So while we might not get Fortnite, Apex Legends, or Dota 2 on Google’s platform, there’s a good chance this service could very well be a place to play big-budget, single-player games like Assassin’s Creed. 






Google could team up with Ubisoft and id Software for launch

If you needed more evidence that Google may bill its service as a destination for big single-player experiences, look at its list of early partners that will be in attendance and hosting sessions alongside the company at GDC. Google specifically calls out legendary shooter franchise Doom and its creator, Id Software, as one of its developer day session participants. 

Additionally, Google says Ubisoft is another one of its partners. Uncharted director Amy Hennig, who recently left EA, will also be on a Google-sponsored panel with a representative from Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics and game designer Raph Koster. Now, we don’t know what this level of involvement translates to; these companies could just be trotted out to shower Google with technical praise and show off a demo or two. 

But, if Assassin’s Creed, Doom, and Tomb Raider are in fact early titles you’ll be able to play on Google’s service, it does create the impression that Google wants this to be more of a console-grade competitor for single-player games, and not just an Android game streaming service. Plus, those are titles that won’t require you need perfect latency and ultra-low ping to play because you’re not interacting with other online. 

It’s too early and we know too little to say for sure what else Google’s gaming announcement might involve. But for a company that has spent years eyeing the gaming space, it looks like now is a prime time to jump in. Every major publisher and console maker wants to be the first to crack cloud gaming and get in on the ground floor of what could be the biggest shift in how games are developed and sold since the iPhone. 

What’s even more exciting is that cloud gaming opens up",,slimgigs,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Everything we think we know about Google’s mystery gaming announcement – The Verge,Post,,

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,laserblaster,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

You can adjust but it will never be as good as playing it on a local machine, though it would be fine for things like turn based games. Latency is much more punishing in this case because your actions don't near immediately get executed, there's both a delay between what is happening in game being delivered to you and your inputs being delivered to the server, and even buffering 5 frames at 60 fps is going to add nearly 100ms to whatever delay is already present from encoding the video and the latency between client and server. I played all of the last of us on psnow because I don't own a playstation console, while it was certainly playable the delay took a lot of adjusting to get used to and it still wasn't great, I definitely wouldn't want to play like that all the time.",,pencilbagger,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Sure it hasn't set the world on fire but on the other hand they've stuck with it so the service obviously works well enough to have some people using it. Not to mention that as I said, some European ISPs even offer this as a service to customers. If you are a Telecom Italia customer you can do game streaming right now, today. The game selection isn't world-class or anything but one of the games you can stream is Arkham City, which strikes me as a good choice because the combat system is pretty generous so even a fair amount of lag is probably easy to get used to. The idea demonstrably works well enough that several companies have products you can buy at the moment.

I've been pc/nintendo for a while now. Unfortunately you just can't get nintendo games on the pc. Well you can't get Sony games on PC either, its seems the only console manufacturer that actually puts out most of their games on PC is Microsoft. That is not true. Except for the latest games, many of Sony's older exclusives(including some from this gen) are available on PSNow which you can access on PC or via emulators. The Quantic games exclusives including Detroit Become Human are also about to be offered on the Epic website on PC. Eventually all the newer exclusives will also be made available on PSNow on PC. MS also owns the Windows OS platform on PC so basically they are offering their games on their own platform on PC and not just on Xbox One. They have been publishing PC games(MS Flight Simulator) long before even the Windows OS existed. Yeah Sony will offer their games on PC after they feel those specific games are no longer driving console sales which is pretty smart. I’m sure by the time PS5 comes out and they no longer care about selling PS4s they will put all the PS4 exclusives on PSNow. If you don’t mind waiting 4-5 years to play a game then there’s no point in buying consoles... I have thousands of games on steam. It will take a long time for me to get to the major games in my backlog much less the few games that Sony keeps exclusive. I can wait. There are plenty of multi-platforms(majority of games) to keep me busy, including hundreds of PC exclusives(from RTS to grand strategy to MOBA and flight simulator games) that are currently not available on consoles. Besides with the advent of live streaming, I think that Sony will eventually need to release their exclusives early. Otherwise they eventually will lose out on the billions of non console gamers on mobile, PC, smart phones, tablets, etc. that Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon are maneuvering to try gain a market share in.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.

Did Google build a gaming console? Believe it or not, it actually might have happened.


The behemoth search-engine-turned-world-conqueror released an extremely cryptic teaser on Tuesday ahead of the upcoming Game Developers Conference next week. The video shows a series of densely rendered, 3D locations-many of them reminiscent of classic video game settings, like a racing car garage and an aircraft hangar-with the caption, “Gather around as we unveil Google’s vision for the future of gaming.” 

This isn’t the first time Google has been a presence at GDC. The company made appearances in the past to unveil products and tools, such as the industry-leading AR/VR technology it announced last year. But this year may be different. Following massive developments in its Project Stream beta test, it seems Google is primed to leap into the gaming world in a big way. And when a company like Google says it’s about to rock the boat, we better brace for maximum impact. Here’s everything we know about Google’s mysterious “future of gaming” plans so far.

Gather around as we unveil Google’s vision for the future of gaming at #GDC19. Join us live 3/19 at 10 a.m. PT → https://t.co/rb6fN26PDi pic.twitter.com/Vd242KZAWO
- Google (@Google) March 12, 2019
Is Google making a console?

It’s hard to say for sure if Google will unveil hardware at GDC19. Though, as reported by Ars Technica, there are some pretty big giveaways. Rick Osterloh, the senior vice president of hardware at Google, shared the teaser video on his personal Twitter account, seemingly confirming his involvement with the big announcement. And not only that, but, as Ars Technica found, the Google Store is hosting a page for the GDC livestream. If it’s not selling a device of some sort, then why reserve a spot for something on its digital storefront?

Has Google made a console before?

Though Google has never seriously attempted to get into the console race against PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, this would not be the first time it released gaming-ready hardware. Of course, devices like the Google Pixel and any Android phone are all completely capable of running video games, but most of us tend to forget about the short-lived Google Nexus Player. Released in 2014, the Nexus Player was essentially an Apple TV that could run Google’s vast library of Android games with an operating system called “Android TV” and a gaming controller. Though the Nexus Player worked, its fate was similar to other “microconsoles” such as the Mad Catz M.O.J.O or the short-lived Ouya: It failed to attract the attention of the serious console gaming community.

What about that Google controller patent?

A number of tech sites recently shared an image of what looks like a patent filed by Google in January for a gaming controller. PC Gamer says that the patent is actually focused on a “notification system” for a controller. The concept showcases an interface for friend invites, changes in leaderboard status, and app-related functions.

But, lest we forget, companies file patents constantly. For instance, one time Nintendo patented a phone that let you play Super Mario DX. Obviously, nothing ever came of it.






What is Project Stream?

In October of 2018, Google unveiled a limited beta test for its bonkers new streaming tech known as Project Stream. The mind-blowing beta allowed lucky participants to play Ubisoft’s recent Triple-A title, Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey inside their Google Chrome browsers. It’s a wonder this technology wasn’t bigger news at the time. Essentially, if you had access to a computer with a fairly robust internet connection (25 megabits per second, to be exact), you could run Odyssey at pretty much full quality. That’s insane, especially when considering that only 10 years ago, most of the internet was still playing Flash Games on Candystand.com. 

The craziest part? It worked. Beta testers reported that the game ran smoothly within their browsers, and could be played seamlessly with a keyboard and mouse, or controller. The tech is quite complex, but Google pulled it off by taking processing heavy-lifting away from the laptop and putting it into its own server-farms. Through streaming, Google was able to process these high-powered visuals and deliver the game to players via the cloud. Though tech like this already exists, like Sony’s Playstation Now service, it’s bewildering to see it happen inside the same internet browser we all use to check our emails and watch cat videos.

When do we find out the truth about these Google console rumors?

GDC19 starts on Monday, March 18 at 1 p.m. EDT. Google’s big announcement happens the following day, Tuesday, March 19 at 1 p.m. EDT. You can watch the livestream here via Youtube.

OnLive and Gaikai becoming PlayStation Now, the future for Cloud gaming seems little bit uncertain in a sense. My thoughts as a console gamer who will always prefer a physical product is that this market must surely see that these intentions to all have their own service must over saturate the market. Sony has PSNow, Google is launching Stadia and Microsoft is launching xCloud. There are rumours also that Apple, Amazon, GameStop and Wallmart are looking at their own game streaming services also. Which begs the question, in the heat of everyone trying to get involved, will this market become over saturated? The thing is, games sell consoles and platforms. Exclusive ones more-so. So would all these companies acquire or form development companies to make games for their services? Or will they all just end up courting EA, Ubisoft, Capcom, Namco etc. into providing games for their service? Cause I think if that was simply the case, it's really going to come down to quality of service and pricing to determine the dominant service. While everyone has their own opinions and feelings when it comes to gaming and the future of gaming media, I do wonder if this market might hurt itself like mobile games have by having so many services that make it hard to stand out and be unique in a field of similar services,",,FF:Enhanced_Reality,United Kingdom,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Numbers one and two are somewhat negligible because any system can accomplish these for you. Sports games are available on all platforms.

I still don't really like the idea of game streaming and in a world where companies seem to think streaming is the answer to everything, I will need a lot of convincing that someone can stream a game flawlessly, while other people in the house stream tv, music or whatever. This needs to work immediately or it will be ridiculed and forgotten about as just another attempt at something others have tried to do and also failed. But it will be interesting to see how this is priced, what will be available and how Sony, MS and Nintendo will respond. I think unlike those other endeavours you mentioned, this is probably the very first and true ""Game Streaming Service"" backed up by very deep pockets and tech know how to make the vision more feasible than others. I remember when Sony purchased and rebranded to their PlayStation Now and i feel like Sony will watch with interest to see what Google is doing and how to technologically compete with them and leverage the PlayStation brand for that. I think there are definite concerns that need to be addressed and tbh, i don't think PS5 etc. have anything to seriously worry about but the concern is that if Stadia does during the PS5 gen start getting that foothold and constantly progressing and overcoming the hurdles thrown out there, then during the PS6 gen there really will be a question on what traditional games consoles and gaming looks like at that point. What form will it take. I love traditional hardware and i see the role of technology from streaming as being there to further enhance the experience beyond what's possible on the box. Think 4K and basic textures connected to a streaming platform and then enhanced to another level beyond what just the box provides through cloud based Ray Tracing, enhanced textures etc. The future offers exciting prospects but not without concerns.

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller.

No more buying PC upgrades, no more buying new consoles...no more spending thousands of dollars in the future for that. I’ll just grab my Xbox One Elite controller and play the newest games just using the smart tv.

Could very much be the beginning of competing in the post console world Sony mentioned, which they probably knew what would be coming and unfortunately they just don’t have the big infrastructures and better network systems Google and Microsoft has and have been building.

Just what if thoughts of future console gaming changes we don’t expect coming...just trying to see what happens if all this goes well with Stadia...I definitely will have a hard time justifying getting the new PS5 if I can just play majority of the games on hardware I already have and it’ll more than likely look better as well with scaleable and stackable hardware of Google’s Stadia.",,jeffyg3,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,,,,,,,,

Google jumps into gaming with Google Stadia streaming service



Google

SAN FRANCISCO—At the Game Developers Conference, Google announced its biggest play yet in the gaming space: a streaming game service named Google Stadia, designed to run on everything from PCs and Android phones to Google’s own Chromecast devices.

Google Stadia will run a selection of existing PC games on Google’s centralized servers, taking in controller inputs and sending back video and audio using Google’s network of low latency data centers.

Google’s announcement follows weeks of teases and hints of a major announcement centered on some sort of streaming gaming solution. It also follows the public beta test of Google’s Project Stream, which let players try Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in a browser window. Google CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned that this test hinted to “the worst-kept secret in the industry” and reached “19 regions, 58 zones, and 200 countries.”

“Think about the way the web works,” Pichai told the GDC crowd. “You can easily share a link and it works seamlessly. We want games to feel that way too. Instantly enjoyable with access for everyone.”

The idea of streaming games in general has been enjoying something of a resurgence since the failure of streaming service OnLive earlier in the decade. Sony’s PlayStation Now, Nvidia’s GeForce Now, and other similar services also run games on centralized servers and sned the resulting video and audio over the Internet.

Stadia is planned for launch this year and allows you to stream games across a variety of devices with very little friction. It could be a very big deal for gaming going forward. The platform aims to bring together playing, spectating, and developing games onto a single platform. As an example, you could view Assassin's Creed Odyssey on YouTube and then begin playing it through streaming in ""as little as five seconds."" Things like game updates and patches and system requirements are effectively a non-issue, because the game is running on Google's servers, rather than your local device. Google VP Phil Harrison promised the technology will work across desktops, laptops, TV, tablets, and phones. In a demonstration, the same demo was seen working across a Chromebook, smartphone, tablet, and TV, the latter through a Chromecast Ultra HDMI streamer. At launch it will stream in 4K at 60 FPS with surround sound and HDR support, and in the future Google is planning to support 8K resolution and frame-rates upwards of 120 FPS. Harrison also promised that the platform will embrace cross-platform play. You'll be able to use existing controllers on laptops and PCs, and Google will offer its own Stadia controller. The Google Stadia controller links to whichever device you're playing on, and it sports a dedicated Google Assistant button for referencing walkthrough videos if you get stuck. Gamespot . Another Gamespot article says that it doesn't work very well, even on a 20Mbps connection. ====================::==================== No interest cause Google. PSNow works fine for less twitchy games. I didn't like it for FPS and I really enjoy visual clarity which at times portions of the screen would be a bit blocky on occasion. I just don't want that at all.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,richard-hollabackgirl-nixon,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console.",,Vichy360,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA Access could reportedly be on the way to PlayStation 4,,,

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade."" Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft's xCloud, Apple's service is not cloud-based.

But what do you expect/predict they'll do when it comes to streaming next gen(for Nintendo uproarious laughter is a valid response)? Google might have some sort of box but that's up in the air, could just be a service, like what xCloud might be, maybe? Amazon are probably working on something streaming based: because they've weren't adding enough fuel to GameStop's funeral pyre. Nvidia are still working away on something are far as I can tell. But what are your predictions, wild dreams and bare minimum expectations for our terrifying disc-less future where we have ever less control over what we actaully own and have rights to as consumers * looks for brown paper bag for hyperventilating into * Personally I think Mircosoft, Amazon and Google will go all in on streaming competing for the game everything anywhere market. Nintendo will continue to do Nintendo shit and make enough money to fuel a small country purely off of Pokemon-hardware-bundle sales. And Sony will offer a streaming service but i'll be less robust than the other options being focused on streaming to a console or TV while still selling a box(mid-tier PC) for premium gaming experiences. Basically MS, Amazon and Google all want to become the Netflix/Hulu/etc. for games, Sony wants to be the entire box office film industry turning a profit (just no Super Normal Profits) on AAA/Blockbusters and indie experiences best had as we currently do and Nintendo will keep selling Labos with DIY covers out of the back of a sedan at a flee market. ====================::==================== basicallyolly marked this as the best answer I mean, Playstation are in the hat in a small way with PSNow. They must have plans to make that more prominent whilst trying to sell us one more box. Google have the money and raw server power but Sony have a legacy and decades of titles they can point towards. It's bizarre, though. If this catches on, the web infrastructure has to move with it. Google themselves have shown have difficult that can be with their youtube algorithms acting poorly as moderation for their service. As a consumer, this is exciting. The idea that the money I could spend on a PC upgrade can go to a subscription instead would be a nice alternative. Assuming it runs at a level I'm okay with. From a developer standpoint, what does this do to costs? Designing to a set spec like they do today might at least help put a cap on development spend. If there is no ceiling, what does this do to an already fragile development space? Do we get developers aiming for unreachable goals and then having to make it back by sales numbers they can't hit?

Google’s GDC 2019 streaming games service announcement: Watch here



When you think of ways to play big-name video games, you probably think of Microsoft’s Xbox, Sony’s PlayStation or Nintendo’s Switch. 

If Google has its way, you’ll soon be considering its Project Stream service too. 

The tech giant is expected to announce a new streaming game service at a press event during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. Google already showed off the service running Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Odyssey during a public test late last year. And on Monday, the company showed off a new squiggle (or “s”?), which appears to be the likely logo for the streaming service.  

Google teased its announcement with a video game museum.


 James Martin/CNET


The service allows gamers to play standard PC games within Google’s Chrome browser. The games are powered by Google’s high-performance computers, which then stream the images to the web browser in a similar way Netflix streams videos.  

Google isn’t the only company doing this. Sony’s offered its PlayStation Now game streaming service since 2014, and chipmaker Nvidia offers one called GeForce Now. Microsoft is also readying an Xbox-related game streaming service, called Project xCloud, expected in the next couple of years. 

In the meantime, Google drummed up interest in its streaming event when it posted a YouTube countdown page, inviting visitors  to “Discover a new way to play.” The company also is asking people to sign up to receive more information after its announcement. 

Here are the details: 

 When? 

Tuesday, March 19: 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET 

 Where? 

We’ll have the livestream right here, so you can follow along in real time. 

The event itself is happening in San Francisco, and the CNET team will be there.

What can we expect? 

Rumors are Google will introduce both its streaming service and potentially a controller to go with it. Also, expect the company to talk about game partnerships with companies like Ubisoft, which it partnered with during its public trial. 

CNET’s Lori Grunin contributed to this report.

The Google Stadia if all goes well will overtake the PS4 and Xbox in overall users by the 10th console generation. By that time Xbox and Sony would have released their 9th gen consoles and have been hit with a significant dip in overall sales. Both Sony and Microsoft would then completely shift all their attention towards their streaming services mainly PlayStation Now ( or whatever it's called in the future) and Xbox Game Pass ( or whatever it's called by then) but by that point it would already be too late In the following the beginning of gen 10 we would see Google's sStadia ( or whatever they call it in the future) become the dominant way to play games (I'm excluding PC and Nintendo users here because A. Nintendo at the time of writing this does not hold as much of the market as Sony and Microsoft do and B. the PC market most likely won't be affected too much by Google Stadia but will face a big change in the coming years (more on that soon)) over PlayStation and Xbox in The western hemisphere. I believe that Sony will shift all its focus onto the Eastern and developing markets and Microsoft will discontinue the console versions of Xbox and instead opt to directly compete with Google for the casual gamer market.,,polygonalnoises,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I assume it's a way of trying to get iOS out of the ""freemium"" trap it is in. However part of me still hopes that Apple plans a major push with a new Apple TV. Yeah, I'm not sure who would subscribe to this gaming service. No Apple hardware justifies paying a monthly fee for games, IMO. But the fact they compared the power of the A12X to an Xbox One may be a sign of things to come. If Apple were serious about games, they would release a dedicated TV model because the current design really cannot accommodate any AAA game. They need to bundle a pair of controllers and give it a descent amount of storage. That'd be at least 1TB, and given the price of SSD's of that size, a fusion drive would be in order, which would have consequences on the size of the box. Or they may offer an optional ""gaming kit"" that would include controllers and an external USB-C drive (SSD or fusion). You can't really make a small media box and pretend it's a game console. The current TV shows it doesn't work. Given the current games the 4K AppleTv is adequate if they have a streaming solution like Google’s New Stadia or Sony’s PlayStation Now service. But the controller is wholly inadequate, even if they somehow make it work with an iPhone or iPad. They need dedicated controllers. I've long thought that instead of different storage capacities – who needs 64 GB in an Apple TV? – they should sell a base model with the Siri remote and then a higher-tier model with an included game controller. Or, at the very least, offer an option of adding on a controller when you buy an Apple TV. Across the entire mini-site for the Apple TV, they barely even mention controllers at all. All they say is: Quote: Game controllers, speakers, and headphones are just a few of the accessories that will make your Apple TV gaming and entertainment experience even better. Quote: And when you add accessories like game controllers and headphones, you can take your experience to the next level. If they want to seriously push gaming, they need to either include a controller or offer it as an option, and at least have a section of the website showing Apple TV versions of popular iPhone games or something. Right now, it feels like ""well, there's an App Store, so you can play games if you want, if you want to bother buying a separate controller."" It's sort of like because it's technically possible, they support it, but that's the extent of it.",,daGUY,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

And it will grow more, because it isn't disrupted by generations and has to start all over. So, why do I think this? First of all, this was a presentation clearly intended for game developers (no surprise at the Game Developers Conference). And from the perspective of a game developer there was a lot to love. This was not a presentation for gamers - I expect this will happen later. So from a gamers view some things still seem unclear. What was there for a game developer to love? Well, the presentation clearly was intended to show that everyone can pick up gaming pretty simple. Google is lying a bit if they say you don't need something special - you need Chrome. But as pretty much everyone already has it, this hurdle is not very big. So they are showing the game developers a potentially big userbase with no need to sell them something first before they can joining Stadia. Hundreds of millions of people already have a working installation to joining Stadia and play. Secondly they showed that bringing people into playing a game is extremely easy. As easy as an youtube streamer has a simple link and people liking the video can play the same game instantly. This is extremely helpful for smaller developers to bring people to play their game. Google even showed that the youtubers probably can connect closer to the community offering this, so the game developers can be content this feature will be used. Google also convinced them that they have a defined platform so that the developers don't have to add options for different hardware configurations, while this platform is also powerful enough to be not restricting at the moment. I am sure Google will update this standard platform once a year or so, but developers can develop for a defined platform similar to a console, while having few power constraints like on PC. Google also showed that they have the most common middleware like Unreal engine and Unity already lined up for their platform. They also showed how the platform can support game development (the demo showing how different artstyles are applied to a polygon model) and multiplayer. This means more exciting options in games with less development time. This all says to me, that right there at GDC Google will be able to win over a lot of smaller developers for the platform, so that they can show a more impressive lineup then they launch. But Google wasn't sleeping either. In the short video they showed Trials, Just Dance and Assassins Creed, so obviously Ubisoft is on board. The showing of Doom Eternal was registering Bethesda support, but that presentation was actually more to assure the input lag wouldn't be too bad. They also said they have first party development, without going into detail. This more or less shows me, that Google is aware they need games to push the platform and were active in that direction. But why do I think they will succeed? Now, people here are focused on image quality, compression, data plans and input lag. But in reality losses in image quality, compression and data plans isn't holding back Netflix. To the point Disney and Warner decided to start a competition. So while many users in this forum care about this stuff, many people outside this forum will not care or even notice. Input lag could ruin your experience. That's why Google showed Doom Eternal. This is less about the game per se, but more about: look, this game that is really fast-paced works on Stadia and id software is convinced enough of it to go with the platform. So I think Google has reduced the problem enough to make it viable for a majority. Still, avid gamers will complain about the lag. But I am very convinced Stadia will bring a lot of people into gaming, which are currently on the fence or play sporadically. And the potential in this group is huge. Google might have a blue ocean here (not for long, I will come to this). So basically what I take from this presentation is the following: Google knows what they are doing, they touched enough of the points so that I know they thought of it. Stadia could bring many people into gaming which are currently reluctant. The potential is huge, as pretty much everyone has a device with Chrome. They have lined up support from middleware and gaming companies and this presentation was made to bring in more game developers for securing a great lineup. The convinience of this system is better than current console platforms. Why hasn't gaming catched on so far and what does Google differently? Well, the convenience is the main point here. The presentation drove home the point that everyone on pretty much every device can play with Stadia. They need no special client, no special hardware, simply a browser. So far I don't see it that much. I do think though that this offer will not stay unmatched. I can think Microsoft is already thinking in this direction. Also Amazon has the capabilities to offer their own service. But Google has for now started and has the first mover advantage. I see many people in this forum will say Stadia will fail, with the same reasons they explain why Netflix never can work and Bluray is better. The reasons are completely true, but will not matter for the majority of people. And I am pretty much convinced Google has secured the points that matter. 3DS-FC: 4511-1768-7903 (Mii-Name: Mnementh), Nintendo-Network-ID: Mnementh, Switch: SW-7706-3819-9381 (Mnementh) my greatest games: 2017 , 2018 Predictions: Switch / Switch / Switch / MHWorld / GOW > BOTW / Switch vs. XB1 in the US View Post Around the Network The_Liquid_Laser Currently Offline View Profile View Posts Games Collection 5,813 1776 posts since 10/11/17 Recent Badges: Leaving Limbo 100 posts on the gamrConnect forums.

They aren't going to be alone in this game. Either way, I see Stadia being more like Amazon Video than Netflix. A large company, but ultimately with less content and userbase than a smaller, older player in the game which came later to the same innovative, onlie market.

Currently Playing: Far Cry 2 (PC) shikamaru317 10 hours ago I see several roadblocks they will need to overcome: -Lack of high speed internet access in rural areas. Looking like this will take at least 5-10 years to overcome this roadblock, as ISP's are being slow to roll out white space internet and super wi-fi to provide high speed to rural areas -Many ISP's, including the largest in the US, Comcast, have data caps. Comcast has a 1 TB a month cap, and it is being reported that Stadia will use 20 GB per hour, which means you would eat through your entire 1 TB allotment in just 50 hours of gaming. The only thing that is likely to overcome this roadblock is government oversight, the government stepping in to force the ISP's to get rid of data caps, because they have no intention of getting rid of them on their own. -Many ISP's are known to throttle connection speeds for users who do alot of streaming on Netflix and the like, they will very likely do the same for Stadia, which will effect the image quality of the stream. Once again, government oversight is the only thing likely to overcome this barrier, as the ISP's have no intention of getting rid of streaming throttles.

As mentioned here: https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/g...e-spotify-on-playstation-music-on-playstatio/ (I'm asking - I don't know the answer) The platforms cut doesn't make them a monopolist. But for Game/Apps cut has been pretty much standard at 30% from multiple digital storefronts/platforms for some time(likely including all the Consoles), and Apple didn't start it. Steam takes ~30%. Though policies vary more on subscriptions. It's just lately that you are getting more pushback from devs on the standard 30% cut that just about every successful digital storefront takes on Apps/Games. People calling digital storefronts/platforms a monopoly are mistaken. A monopolist is generally considered the sole producer of a product for which there are no close substitutes. Android phones would obviously be considered a close substitute for iPhones. Just like Xbox would be considered a close substitute for PlayStation. Now if you have 97% of the market like Microsoft had, then you can start throwing around the monopolist tag, but when you have 20%, is nothing more than disingenuous whining.",,Bytor65,Canada,Ontario,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

It’s more likely for them to put out their own platform that accomplishes the same thing and competes although the field is growing by the year.

183662159216,3/23/2019,http://slimgigs.tumblr.com/post/183662159216,"One of the big announcements that Apple could make during its reveal event on Monday is a new video game service. According to Bloomberg, Apple is creating a “premium games subscription” service for the App Store. Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft’s xCloud, Apple’s service is not cloud-based.

Instead, it will focus on iPhones and iPads and bundle together paid games from different developers that consumers can access for a monthly fee,” Bloomberg reported.

One source said Apple will pay developers based on how much time users spend playing their title. The report goes on to claim that the service would only feature paid games, not free-to-play titles. The report also says the service may not be announced on Monday, but instead during its developer conference in June. That timing would be intriguing, as it’s just before E3.

According to analyst Serkan Toto, this kind of package offering is already available in Japan. He also points out that, if free-to-play games are indeed excluded, then Nintendo’s upcoming Mario Kart Tour wouldn’t be eligible. As you may recall, Apple partnered with Nintendo in a big way to promote and release the free-to-play Mario game Super Mario Run.

Problem is: if the article is to be believed, F2P content is excluded.
For Mario Kart Tour, both Nintendo and DeNA confirmed (not only one time) it will not be a paid game.
Let’s see.

 — Dr. Serkan Toto (Kantan Games Inc.) (@serkantoto) March 23, 2019

Go to Bloomberg to get the full story.

An earlier report suggested the March 25 Apple news conference will include the formal reveal of Apple’s plans for its own Netflix-style TV streaming service. All should become clear soon.

Let’s block ads! (Why?)

183702556018,3/25/2019,http://adamwarnerblog.tumblr.com/post/183702556018,"At this year’s Game Developer Conference in San Francisco last week, Google finally pulled the curtain back on one of the worst kept secrets in gaming: Google Stadia, its games streaming service. This article does a capable job of explaining what the Stadia is, but in a nutshell: Stadia is a cloud-based games streaming service that allows players to interact with video games instantly, without downloading anything, on their tablets, laptops, televisions, and mobile phones so long as their internet connection is sufficiently fast. Some specific hardware requirements, such as the fact that Stadia will not work on non-Pixel Android phones at launch, have dampened the lofty aspirations of the service, though.

Stadia isn’t the first ambitious cloud-based games streaming service to come to market: OnLive somewhat infamously was sold for less than $5MM after raising more than $50MM in financing and reaching a peak valuation of nearly $2BN. Gaikai fared better with a $380MM sale to Sony in 2012 and now allegedly powers the “Playstation Now” service, and GameFly acquired Playcast in 2015 to deliver what it called a “Netflix for Games” service. 

That term is important, as it has become something of a popular call to arms lately as a number of different companies, from Microsoft to Amazon to Apple to Electronic Arts and a subsidiary of Rovio, have announced products that could be deemed a “Netflix of Gaming”. And in fact, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s CEO, may have tipped his hand for such an endeavor from Netflix itself when he stated that the company “compete(s) with (and lose(s) to) Fortnite more than HBO. When YouTube went down globally for a few minutes in October, (Netflix’s) viewing and signups spiked for that time.”

Almost nothing is known about how Stadia will source content, what it will cost to use, what requirements will be placed on developers in order to have their games appear on the platform, etc. Former Ubisoft executive Jade Raymond recently joined Google to head an internal first-party studio to make games for Stadia, but it’s unknown how large that studio will be or how many games it will publish per year. Google will surely expect to lean heavily on third-party developers for content on the Stadia at launch and for the foreseeable future. As Netflix would certify, being the Netflix of something is expensive: the company is expected to spend $15BN on content in 2019.

And indeed, as this article asserts, the Stadia may be more of a YouTube strategy than a games streaming strategy — or, at least, the Stadia may serve the purpose of further aggrandizing YouTube as games streaming goes mainstream. 50BN hours of gameplay footage were watched on YouTube in 2018, and 200MM people watch gameplay footage each day on YouTube: YouTube is an important part of the gaming ecosystem, and Stadia unifies the viewing experience and the first-hand playing experience in a way that could create a powerful virtuous circle between first-person and third-person gaming engagement. Players will be able to drop pins into gameplay footage on YouTube and then immediately open the game at that moment and start playing. Likewise, players will be able to seamlessly switch between devices, retaining their in situ game state.

It is that last capability that could perhaps be the most monumental promise of Stadia: if every game is playable on a mobile device (all computation is done in the cloud, so end-user hardware profile is irrelevant), then every game is a mobile game. And the Stadia effectively distintermediates the app stores: with Stadia, there is no download requirement in playing a game, and the click-to-stream mechanism effectively extends game discovery to the entire surface area of the web. If game distribution escapes the app stores, then the entire mobile advertising ecosystem could become upended, with a critical pain point — the click-to-install conversion dynamic — being circumvented and otherwise poorly-converting ad inventory like mobile web banners, interstitials, and, conveniently for Google, YouTube inventory becoming suddenly very interesting to mobile advertisers. 

This could be a very interesting development. The mobile app ecosystem has been trending toward intermediation as the biggest mobile properties start to look more and more like app stores themselves; Stadia could change that by abstracting away the idea of an app store, at least as games are concerned. Of course, a vast amount of territory exists between now and Stadia being a hugely successful platform that has materially, indelibly changed the landscape of the mobile app ecosystem. Stadia is a complex, ambitious undertaking, so of course it could fall; it’s frankly annoying that so many media commentators elect to vocalize that very obvious fact.

But if the Stadia is successful, it will have a massive impact on the way that smartphone users interact with games. That possibility is intriguing.

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Depending on what games you play this could be a good deal.

Steam Link Anywhere is ""my device"" streams to ""another one of my devices."" Meaning I have access to all the files, I can do modifications to my files and stream them. Google's Project Stadia is cloud computing alike to Nvidia's GeForce Now, where neither the hardware is yours, but the game files are on the cloud and you can't touch them at all. Microsoft's cloud computing is similar to PlayStation Now, where it's the console that's on cloud allowing streaming from them to any device. (i.e. you can play console-only games that are on Xbox One on PC using that.) \--- Another thing I have respect for Valve with is Proton. While there's Wine and other solutions, it's cool to see a company as big as Valve support Linux gaming as much as they're doing.

Peloton is being sued for using music without permission in its video fitness classes Several members of the National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) have collectively filed a lawsuit against fitness startup Peloton today, seeking over $150 million in damages. The complaint, filed by Downtown Music Publishing, Ultra Music, and eight other publishing groups, says that Peloton has been using their musical works for years in its…

Summary

 * The complaint says that Peloton does have some licenses in place with other labels and publishers 
 * 000 musical works owned or administered by Plaintiffs over a period of years in the videos that it makes available to its hundreds of thousands of customers without a synchronization (or “sync”) license 
 * Some of the works the complaint says Peloton is using without proper licensing include “Shallow” by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper 
Uber Eats rolls out confusing new fees — here’s what they mean

Uber Eats rolls out confusing new fees — here’s what they mean Uber Eats rolled out its new fees structure this week, and most people are confused about what the new fees mean. Instead of a booking fee for each order, Uber is now splitting up its fee into a delivery and service fee, and adding a small order fee of $2 when your order total is less than $10. Here’s what it actually means. From the homepage of…

Summary

 * “We’ve seen a number of changes to the fee structure on Uber Eats over the past year which tells me they’re experimenting and trying to figure out the best way to get profitable on this service 
 * It denies that customers’ unhappiness last year with the quiet fee shift had anything to do with its decision to be more transparent this time around

NASA spacecraft discovers its target asteroid is spewing material and is much more rugged than expected

NASA spacecraft discovers its target asteroid is spewing material and is much more rugged than expected NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft made an astonishing discovery about the asteroid it has been orbiting since December: the rock is actively spewing material out into space. The asteroid, named Bennu, has ejected materials up to 11 times since the spacecraft has been there. But no one is sure what exactly is causing these bursts. The revelation is ju…

Summary

 *  the OSIRIS-REx team interpreted that there were a lot of smooth areas of fine grains on the surface of the asteroid — like large patches of sand — and very few boulders 
 * But Lauretta and his team have realized that they’re going to need more accuracy than that because there aren’t any smooth areas that large on Bennu’s surface 
 *  the scientists have found that some of these particles are injected into space while other particles actually rain down on the asteroid

Google Stadia uses a custom AMD chip to offer 10.7 teraflops of cloud gaming power

Google Stadia uses a custom AMD chip to offer 10.7 teraflops of cloud gaming power The beauty of a cloud gaming service is two-fold: 1) you can theoretically play any game, anywhere you’ve got a good enough internet connection to stream it over the net, and 2) even if you’re playing it on a wimpy smartphone, you can harness the power of a beefy server located in a data center. But what kind of server matters a whole heck of a …

Summary

 *  given how many players may be using those servers at a given time — and it turns out that Google’s just-announced Stadia cloud gaming service may have struck a balance between power and price by partnering with AMD for a new custom piece of silicon 
 *  game developers could design their games to use many distributed GPUs for more impressive graphics than any single beefy gaming PC would be capable of on its own — but then there’s the economics to think about 
 * One of the big problems with early cloud gaming services like OnLive and PlayStation Now has been those economics — if each player needs access to a dedicated computer (or more than one!) living in that server farm

183747742209,3/27/2019,http://freeoceanofamespcgames.tumblr.com/post/183747742209,"Google’s insistence on making Stadia exclusively cloud-based is intriguing to say the least. While the benefits it presents in terms of accessibility and convenience are clear for all to see, questions still persist about the viability of such an idea, and whether there’s sufficient infrastructure in place for Stadia to be able to do what Google wants it to do.

Should it prove to be successful though, could it become a paradigm shift in the industry, one that forces other competitors in the market to re-think their strategies and how they go about their businesses as well? According to industry analyst Michael Pachter, that’s very much a possibility.

Recently we spoke to Pachter, and asked him if Stadia could have any sort of an impact on what Microsoft and Sony are looking to do their their own respective next-gen systems, and according to Pachter, if Stadia should prove to be successful, the two of them could try to emulate its success with xCloud and PlayStation Now.

“I think Microsoft will emulate Stadia if it’s successful, and Sony will try to do the same thing with its PlayStation Now technology, with each likely ultimately deciding to have their own store fronts for streaming,” he said. “This is similar to Amazon competing with iTunes.”

Another question – among many others – that people have been asking most often about Stadia is about its price. When asked about the same, Pachter spoke about various possibilities, from it being a rental business to adopting a subscription model, which, in his view, would be “doomed to fail”.

“If it’s [like] iTunes, games will be $59.99 unless the publishers offer an exclusive window to Microsoft and Sony first,” he said. “If that occurs, games will likely be cheaper. If it’s a subscription, it’s doomed to fail, but they’ll probably try to do it at $19.99 or cheaper per month. If it’s a rental business, it will probably be $1 per hour or so. All pure speculation.”

Sadia’s price, pricing model, and a lot more are going to be revealed later in the year, what with its launch scheduled for late 2019 in the UK, US, Canada, and Europe. Stay tuned to GamingBolt for more coverage on all things Stadia.

183609978667,3/21/2019,http://immedtech.tumblr.com/post/183609978667,"Phil Harrison won’t budge. As a vice president and general manager at Google, he’s spent the past 15 minutes explaining why Stadia, the company’s freshly announced game-streaming service, will actually work on the existing internet infrastructure across North America and Europe. He’s focused on the investments Google has made over the past 20 years in cloud networks, talking up the company’s 7,500 server nodes, custom CPUs and partnerships with major internet service providers.

I’m hesitant to believe him. I lived through the hype of OnLive a decade ago; we’ve heard these promises before, only to be sorely disappointed. Of course, 10 years on, Google is promising even more – seamlessly streaming games at 4K and 60fps with HDR, integrating “play now” options into YouTube, and even loading a specific section of a game via a hyperlink, on any platform, in just five seconds.

“It’s actually closer to three seconds than five seconds,” Harrison told me the day after revealing Stadia on the Google stage at GDC. “But we thought, you know what, five seconds is actually, probably a good enough promise.”



That’s how much confidence Google executives have in Stadia. It’s due to launch later this year (with an unknown payment model), and there’s momentum behind the entire initiative from within and outside of Google.

Harrison is a 25-year veteran of the video game industry who held leading roles at both Sony and Microsoft, and Google picked him up in early 2018; Jade Raymond is the former head of Ubisoft Montreal and executive producer of the first Assassin’s Creed games, and Google recently hired her to lead its Stadia Games and Entertainment arm. The top game-engine companies, Unreal and Unity, are partnering with Google on Stadia, alongside dozens of other studios.

At launch, Google says Stadia will be able to stream any participating game to any device – including Chromecasts, smartphones, tablets, laptops and PCs – at up to 4K and 60fps, plus it’ll enable a handful of social and YouTube tricks.

“Our platform is capable of delivering all of the quality, all of the capability that we discussed, over conventional fixed, wired internet into your home,” Harrison said.



The problem I have with Harrison’s repeated assurance is that it relies on things Google has control over, like server hardware and distribution, and a special relationship that Google has with major ISPs. It doesn’t directly address the perpetual problem with game streaming: A lot of people have crappy internet.

No matter how powerful Google’s cloud infrastructure is, in-home and mobile connection speeds are a potential bottleneck that developers can’t R&D away. Harrison answered this critique as follows:

“Google’s been making investments in the fundamental fabric of the internet, the networking within our data centers, the way our data centers are connected, for 20 years. We’ve been a hardware company in the data center for longer than we’ve been a hardware company in Google Home or phones. That gives us some performance advantages in terms of the way the data reaches the ISP and how that data gets to you in your home. That allows us to deliver a very, very high-quality experience.”

Internet distribution has certainly expanded since OnLive and Gaikai tried to tackle low-latency streaming. Statista estimates 109.8 million homes in the US had a fixed broadband subscription in 2017, compared with 84.5 million in 2010. Internet speeds have steadily increased over the years as well, with the US clocking an average download rate of 96.25Mbps in late 2018, according to Ookla. (Stadia recommends a minimum of 25Mbps). Plus, Google’s big Project Stream beta in October went shockingly well. All of this is good for Google.

Engadget

And yet. 96Mbps may be the average internet speed across the US, but it certainly isn’t guaranteed anywhere. The fastest and most reliable internet-delivery system, fiber-optic, is not even available in 70 percent of the country, according to the FCC. Organizations from Microsoft to federal agencies and churches are working to fill in the gaps in rural internet access worldwide, but it’s a tricky problem for any one group to pin down. That includes Google, whose own efforts to establish a national fiber network have more or less dissolved, leaving a trail of useless silvery cables in cities across the country.

Google’s relationship with ISPs is clearly strong. It has a direct-peering relationship with companies like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Sprint, meaning these ISPs are plugged into Google servers, giving Google a clear line of data. Of course, BroadbandNow estimates there are more than 2,000 ISPs in the US, many of them small networks serving rural areas, and Google doesn’t have the same relationship with all of them. In these cases, its data has to bounce its around just like everyone else’s.

“It’s the depth of the pairing relationships that we have with ISPs to bring Google data to the internet today,” Harrison said. “We’re able to build on top of that to build a very high-performing game experience streamed to players. Whereas other streaming services that have come before have had to go through that multi-hop scenario, we know what it takes to get to that high quality.”



There’s no doubt in my mind that Stadia, once it launches, will work. It will load games and they will be playable. However, OnLive technically worked for a lot of users, too. Hell, PlayStation Now exists today and it also functions, but it’s definitely not disrupting the established video game ecosystem.

What matters is how well Stadia will work – and, perhaps more importantly, how well players will expect it to work. If (rather, when) it takes 15 seconds for a link to load a video, or if a game stutters just enough to be annoying the entire way through, or if it cuts out at random times according to the whims of a wily internet connection, Stadia will likely be viewed as a failure, regardless of how far Google’s technology has truly come.

Google is promising incredible things. Aside from 4K, HDR and 60fps, and game loading times as short as three seconds (all from a link, no less), Google is already talking about one day streaming games in 8K and 120fps. Stadia’s technology is scalable and Google is building it to last. But, first, it has to start.

“We also know that we won’t reach everywhere in the world, day one,” Harrison said. “We’re not claiming that we will reach everywhere in the world. The internet connectivity continues to grow, continues to reach more and more people at higher and higher speeds every year. There are some technologies just a little bit over the horizon which we think will be impactful.”

We've shown that we're not against paying a subscription, as seen in the MMO market as well as services like Playstation Now and Origin Access. The problem with implementing something like Xbox Live Gold on the PC market is that 1) game developers don't have an incentive to participate in such a program 2) because there aren't currently any games participating in such a program, there is no incentive for gamers to pay into one. Problem 2 is really just an effect of 1, so let's focus on that. If Microsoft or some other company were to buy exclusivity on a wide number of highly anticipated online games then I think that PC gamers would begrudgingly pay for a subscription. Even if they only kept buying exclusivity for a few years, convincing PC gamers to pay a subscription for online play normalizes the behavior and other companies would likely begin experimenting with the monetization scheme as well.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,broon-the-bane,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

183574176989,3/19/2019,http://timetopstories.tumblr.com/post/183574176989,"Google has officially announced a major new effort in the video game world — and it might just change the future of the roughly $135 billion industry.

Speaking at the annual Games Development Conference (GDC) in San Francisco on Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pinchai unveiled Stadia, a long-rumored cloud-based games streaming service. Unlike with a traditional video game console or computer, which processes a game locally as it’s being played, Stadia games are processed in the cloud, with the action beamed instantaneously to players over the Internet. Google promises a lag-free experience, as long as you have a fast enough Internet connection.


“We are starting our next big challenge: building a game platform for everyone,” Pinchai said. “I think we can change the game by bringing together the power and creativity of the entire community, people who love to play games, people who love to watch games, and people who love to build games.”

Launching sometime later this year, Stadia gamers play on devices they already own, with controllers they already own (though Google also announced its own Stadia controller). “There is no box,” Google Vice President Phil Harrison, a former Sony and Microsoft executive, said. “The data center is your platform.”

Google and partners made it clear that, with Stadia, Google is doing more than simply testing the deep waters of the video game industry. Rather, Stadia is a full-bore effort to fully compete in the industry in four big ways. With Stadia, Google is openly competing as a platform against the industry’s largest players: Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Thanks to close integration with Google’s YouTube, Stadia will also compete against massive streaming services like Twitch. It will go up against enormous games distribution juggernauts like Steam and the upstart Epic Games Store. Finally, the announcement of a new first party game studio potentially puts them in competition with other large publishers like EA and Activision Blizzard. And even if it fails, Stadia will most likely change the video game industry forever.

Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and now Google

Stadia’s biggest impact will depend on how the largest console makers — Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo — will react to Stadia’s presence. The streaming service comes at a pivotal time in gaming. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are thought to be in their waning months as rumors and confirmations have swirled for the past year about the consoles’ official successors.

One facet that Google harped on over and over again for Stadia was its flexibility as a platform. It promised that it could grow with the changing times. When Google initiated Project Stream, which offered a limited number of players access to Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey through its Chrome browser on the day of the game’s launch, it said that it streamed the game at a resolution of up to 1080p and up to 60 frames per second. During Tuesday’s presentation, Google Vice President Majd Bakar said that Stadia, at launch, will support up to a 4K resolution, eventually with capabilities to output up to 8K and 120 frames a second.

Google said the disconnected nature of Stadia allows it to upgrade over time at the server level, rather than users needing to upgrade their own box. “We have built our platform to scale up with the infrastructure,” Bakar said.

Additionally, since the games will live on Google infrastructure, rather than individual home consoles, Harrison said that there wouldn’t be a need for downloads, updates or patches with the games on Stadia. “We wanted to reduce the friction between getting excited about a game and playing a game,” he said. “With Stadia, this waiting game will be a thing of the past.”

Sony’s CEO Kenichiro Yoshida and Xbox boss Phil Spencer have said that both companies are working on hardware for the future, which many believe will be released next year. The possible features of both boxes remain largely unknown, but if they lack the possibility of experiences like Stadia, Google may have already leapfrogged the competition before the next console generation cycle even begins. (Of course, it remains unclear how many top-tier games will be available on Stadia, and gamers tend to go where the good games are.)

Sony and Microsoft each have released platforms that directly stream games to consumers from their respective consoles — Sony rolled out PlayStation Now in 2014 and Microsoft announced Project xCloud last October. It’s clear both companies have long seen the writing on the wall of the future of consoles, but it’s unclear how far out they have built an infrastructure that could support a console-less future. Google’s existing data infrastructure and expertise could give the company a big advantage here.

“If you think about it, there are a lot of barriers for users to play high-end games,” Pinchai said. “Beautiful graphics really need high-end consoles or PCs. And games don’t have instant access.”

Targeting Twitch

Also in Google’s crosshairs: streaming services like Twitch. Google and partners showed off extensive integration between Stadia and YouTube. In one example, a viewer could be watching a stream of a multiplayer game, and join a live queue to play in the very same game as the streamer. 

The Stadia controller, which pairs with whatever device is streaming Stadia over Wi-Fi, also is tied in directly into YouTube, featuring a dedicated button that sends whatever you’re playing to your YouTube profile. 

Today’s presenters mentioned those who “love to watch games” as often as those who loved to play. It’s clear that Google has an eye out for the massive streaming market that has exploded in recent years.

Storming Steam’s Castle

The words “Stadia store” were only mentioned once by Harrison, without further elaboration, but it hinted that there would soon be a completely separate place from the traditional game marketplaces where players could buy their games.

Although Stadia games seem to be completely separate from the usual understanding of “PC games,” the fact that they will be playable on desktops and laptops appears likely to make this mysterious Stadia store a competitor to Steam.

Over the past several years, Steam has become a juggernaut for PC gamers and where the majority of games are purchased. That monopolistic hold over the medium was shaken late last year when Fortnite developer Epic Games announced the Epic Games Store, putting the most popular game in the world on it.

Stadia’s entry promises to turn the once-monolithic PC games market even more on its head. Google’s hefty presence has the possibility of upending how players think about PC games and where they are acquired.

Google the Games Developer

Finally, Tuesday’s announcement puts Google in competition with other game development and publishing studios. Harrison unveiled Stadia Games and Entertainment, describing it as “Google’s own first-party studio.”

Though the details were light, besides announcing its new head Jade Raymond, multiple game concepts designed in-house were shown. 

It seemed as though the studio would vie for partnerships with other development studios, but create plenty of its own games as well. That could turn Google into an AAA games studio in competition with the likes of Activision and EA. 

Win or lose, change is coming

Google’s presentation left an enormous number of questions unanswered, many of which Harrison promised to address this summer. Among the unknowns: Stadia will clearly require users to have speedy Internet connections, but access to high-speed broadband is unequal across the U.S. Google hasn’t announced a price for the service, either. And other companies (though none with the clout of Google) have tried and largely failed to offer a similar service.

Then there’s the matter of which games Stadia will offer. It’s a new platform, and developers haven’t had much time to create games for it yet. Id’s Doom Eternal and publisher/developer Ubisoft were mentioned during Google’s event, but gaming services can live or die on their launch titles. Still, Google’s decision to announce Stadia at the Game Developers Conference — to an audience largely made up of industry insiders and developers — was no doubt a strategic move to build excitement among the very people who will build the games that could potentially lift the platform to success. 

“Today, our industry captivates over 2 billion players from all around the world,” Harrison said. “At the center of that community, its beating heart, are the game developers. The people in this room who create the most incredible game experiences that delight players with engrossing stories, characters and worlds through a dazzling display of technology, artistry and magic.”

Even if Google’s Stadia isn’t an immediate hit, it could change gaming forever. By promising a game-streaming future, free from download times and the need for lots of local processing power, Google has set the bar even higher for what future gamers will expect. The promise of “instant access” is a hope for many gamers, and it’s exactly what Google says is coming. The largest players in the game industry were surely watching today. If they weren’t already hard at work on the diversity, flexibility and performance that Google has promised, they certainly are now.

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Was there any actual claim about partial or distributed GPU loads? I very much got the impression that for your average game, a single rendered viewpoint gets a single blade to itself. That's why there is a tflop cap for a rendered scene, and why they had to resort to gimmicks like splitscreen or multiple cameras to get beyond that cap on a single screen. One GPU per player is expensive but not clearly so when you compare to the console space. I mean Sony has managed to sell 90 million PS4s that spend most of their time collecting dust. Whats a million or so that will see much more use to start a server farm? The answer to your question is Sony sold them. As in, they received a profit from the hardware (or at least broke even) on top of licensing and other things. And those 90 million GPUs are distributed worldwide, their operation paid for again by the end user via utilities. Google is proposing subsidizing the hardware cost (I assume, they haven't released pricing or cost of entry), which is not insignificant. Neither is the cost of having a million 100+ watt GPUs running (given the idea that a million+ concurrent users is not an absurd goal for this service.) Someone's gotta foot that 100 megawatt electric bill. Shared GPU loads would be a huge boon, but as of now they're impossible given current virtual architecture. Not only did they sell PS4s, they have the standard cut of all digitally downloaded software, which gives them a HUGE revenue stream locked into their consoles. They are basically selling boxes that print money, as long as people buy them. Google is going to take some cut as well so I don't see how that part is any different. There's 90 million PS4s out there but the vast majority aren't turned on at the same time. Hell after seven years the majority are probably sitting in a closet at this point. Google can easily support the same modern, active playerbase as the PS4 with a fraction of the GPUs over lifetime simply because not everyone is using them at once. They don't even need to get into load balancing/sharing which their presentation demonstrated zero evidence for and many points agianst. I mean this stuff isn't even groundbreaking. The problem with onlive! wasn't that they didn't have the severs, it was no-one wanting the service. PSnow is just blades of PS4s and its also making a lot more money on the shareholder reports than you'd think based on zero talk about it online. Microsoft is setting up xCloud the same way. Latency, pricing, and consumer interest will be tricky, but just setting up enough hardware to give each active play session its own GPU isn't by compare. PSNow and xCloud are not analogous to Stadia. They're close, but they're not the same in execution. jungleroomx on March 26",,jungleroomx,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,[Google Stadia] Stream all your games anywhere! - Page 16,,,

Google’s Stadia promises ‘instant access’ to Netflix-like streaming games



When you think of ways to play big-name video games, you probably think of Microsoft’s Xbox, Sony’s PlayStation or Nintendo’s Switch. 

If Google has its way, you’ll soon be considering its Stadia service too. 

The tech giant announced its new streaming game service at a press event during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. The new service, called Stadia, is designed as a way for people to play and watch gaming together, Google said. The company said it plans to bring together players, broadcasters on YouTube and game developers to create a new experience.

“Our ambition is far beyond a single game,” said Google’s Phil Harrison. Instead, the company sees the opportunity to give players “instant access” to a game by clicking a link. “The power of instant access is magical, and it’s already transformed the music and movie industries.”

Google teased its announcement with a video game museum.


 James Martin/CNET


The service allows gamers to play standard PC games within anything that can browse the web, including a TV, a phone, a tablet and of course a PC. The games are powered by Google’s high-performance computers, which then stream the images to the web browser in a similar way Netflix streams videos. And they’re streamed at up to 4k high-definition video, at 60-frames per second, meaning animations will move smoothly. 

Gamers play using a controller Google designed, which connects through WiFi to Stadia’s systems.

“It’s seamless,” Harrison said. 

Google isn’t the only company doing this. Sony’s offered its PlayStation Now game streaming service since 2014, and chipmaker Nvidia offers one called GeForce Now. Microsoft is also readying an Xbox-related game streaming service, called Project xCloud, expected in the next couple of years. 

But Google says it can take them on. Stadia is more powerful than Microsoft’s Xbox One X and Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro combined, Google said. And it’s partnered with game development software makers like Epic Games, Unity, Cryengine and others.

Here are the details: 

 When? 

Tuesday, March 19: 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET 

 Where? 

We’ll have the livestream right here, so you can follow along in real time. 

The event itself is happening in San Francisco, and the CNET team will be there.

What can we expect? 

Rumors are Google will introduce both its streaming service and potentially a controller to go with it. Also, expect the company to talk about game partnerships with companies like Ubisoft, which it partnered with during its public trial.

I have recently bought the VR and I am totally amazed with its potential, just a few topics and questions. 1. I am a big CoD fan and love the game play, do you think developers will be focusing on VR game play in the future to make the game play even more realistic? 2. Movies, I have watched a few films with the system on, but as Microsoft have some films in 360 mode, do you think Sony will use the VR to more potential? 3. App development, as every mobile phone has a camera, could an app be developed so that we can look at our 3d photo's and movies in VR? If some of this questions have already been answered then I can only apologise and as mentioned I am new to the PS4 and the VR.

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade."" Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft's xCloud, Apple's service is not cloud-based. The company also unveiled its new Apple TV+ service and a variety of exclusive original shows. https://archive.fo/7ANhX Looks like it's mostly indieshit with expected SJW bullshit or basically just a glorified app store+ but at least it's not streaming only yet . ====================::==================== >dystopia lego moba I can't tell where my feet will land the game btow another shadow of the colossus soyboy makes his way to a coffee shop the game",,Anonymous,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Apple to launch own gaming service,,,

Thanks for the source. Graphics and power at this point have diminishing returns. I'd be pretty much okay with consoles forever having PS4 levels of quality because it's borderline perfect to me at this point. As for ""landing on the same console"", the hypotetical new trilogy began on PS4 this time, so it'd have to end on PS4 according to your reasoning. I'd be okay with a new 2020 R&C game. Consider that the R&C games also have a cartoonish artstyle with some high definition details and whatnot, which means they won't benefit as much from the next gen's additional power. PSNow isn't in every country, and in the countries it's available in it doesn't work for everybody. There's a huge market currently not being served by that platform. Another point: PSNow outputs at 720p max, and there's input lag sometimes (and I got a hell of a good Internet connection, so it's not that). Add to that the issue of not owning your game with PSNow since it's a subscription. As for resources, Sony's got tons of them and I bet Bluepoint would be pretty damn quick in making a Future collection, saving Sony both time and money. PSNow, in short, still isn't a viable alternative to a physical disc containing all 3 Future games (or the 3 games+ITN).",,Valtekken,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

183511518177,3/17/2019,http://earnbitcoinwork.tumblr.com/post/183511518177,"GPU-based cryptocurrency miners have taken a beating throughout this bear market — just ask NVIDIA. However, users with spare GPUs may soon be able to put their ineffective mining hardware to another profitable use: renting rendering power to those looking to experience quality PC gaming on an underpowered computer. 

As reported by TechCrunch, Vectordash is looking to allow people with underpowered rigs not meant for gaming — such as Apple computers — to experience quality PC gaming with the help of individuals willing to rent their spare power for cloud rendering. This means that, in theory, even those with a Macbook Air could game at 4K resolution and 60 frames-per-second, given their internet bandwidth is capable of handling that amount of data.

If this sounds too good to be true, it’s not. Cloud rendering itself is nothing particularly new, so this idea is far from half-baked. Sony launched a cloud rendering service in PlayStation Now years ago — though it never really took off. Nevertheless, the company proved that cloud rendering is a viable option for gaming going forward.

Vectordash’s service will apparently run users $28 per month for cloud rendering capabilities. On the other side of the deal, GPU renters stand to make about $0.60 per day — which isn’t life-changing money for anyone who has the dough to throw at high-powered GPUs. However, the ability to put less-than-profitable meant-for-mining GPUs to work for another reason may help those who have been beaten down by both a bear market and dramatically more powerful ASIC mining rigs.



The key for Vectordash, of course, is offering payments for renters that are competitively priced with cryptocurrency mining returns — which shouldn’t be too difficult, given that GPU mining returns are currently negligible.

What do you think about Vectordash and cloud rendering PC games? Do you have GPUs you bought for cryptocurrency mining that you no longer use? Let us know in the comments below!

183616684978,3/21/2019,http://prosyscomtech.tumblr.com/post/183616684978,"How Google Stadia could be a success



Stadia is Google’s new gaming service that promises latency free 4K quality streaming of AAA games to any device that can run the Chrome browser. The new product offers some interesting gimmicks, such as easy sharing to YouTube and integrated Google Assistant. Can Google make space for itself in the lucrative but entrenched gaming market? It has a chance, if it makes the right moves.

The price must be right

Google has been tight-lipped about Stadia’s business model but, after the initial cost of buying the controller, is likely to go one of two ways:

 * A subscription model in which users don’t buy games but instead pay monthly accesses a full library of titles, i.e. that Netflix of games everyone’s talking about these days. 
 * Google’s own game store a la Steam, Epic Store, Origin, etc, through which users can buy individual games. 
Of the two, a subscription model will likely be more attractive to users, even it means Google will have to invest more into licensing a tempting enough roster. The ability to just pick up and play a game you like, or one that was just shared on YouTube in a ‘save state’, without being interrupted by having to make a purchase is what makes sense for Google’s convenience is king pitch.

The pricing of a subscription model will probably be somewhere between $15-$20 a month, to stay competitive with PlayStation Now ($20/month), Xbox Game Pass ($10/month), Shadow’s high-end streaming service ($30/month) and indeed, Netflix itself, which has identified video games as one of their main rivals for consumers’ attention.

A $15 or $20 monthly fee saves a bunch compared to buying a home console or gaming PC along with several $60 games a year. Of course, it needs to have the games you want to play.

Convenience also needs content

Google became the giant it is today through offering effective, well-integrated, convenient services like Chrome, Gmail, maps and so on for free. I’ve no doubt that the company can make a service that’s user-friendly and smooths out many of the hardware hurdles between game purchasing, loading, sharing, and streaming. Getting and playing a game in one tap after seeing its trailer on YouTube? Sounds great, but that won’t mean anything unless it has the right games on it.

So far we’ve only got Doom Eternal confirmed for Google Stadia, a title that’s also going to be on every other major platform. And while I’m always happy to see somewhere else you can play Doom, it’s not the killer app it used to be, so Google will need more than this to carry its platform. Will we get more titles like Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, which Google used to test Project Stream?

Stadia-exclusive titles will be produced by Stadia Games and Entertainment, a new in-house studio headed by industry veteran Jade Raymond (Electronic Arts, Ubisoft). Google says more than 100 studios already have dev kits for Stadia, and more than 1,000 creatives and engineers are already working on Stadia-compatible titles.

A killer exclusive title that everyone will talk about (and presumably, share all over YouTube) would have been the best way for Stadia to kick off. And sadly, it didn’t. But Google does have both the clout and the cash to come up with something good, and it looks like it has the talent on board too. Will Stadia get a God of War or Mario Kart style megahit to be its flagship franchise? If it can come out swinging with one at launch, that could make all the difference.

Connection speed will be key

Is streaming the future of gaming? Emphasis on future, because right now, 5G fantasies aside, many people in the present day do not have a good or stable enough Internet connection for this to be feasible. Google has outlined that Stadia will require “approximately” 25Mbps download speeds to deliver 4K streaming at 60fps.

If your Internet isn’t up to scratch, and there’s a good chance it won’t be, depending on where you live, then the resulting latency may be unbearable in fast-paced competitive titles, though slower games such as turn-based strategy titles won’t suffer much. This is going to be a deal-breaker for many though…either your connection is good and Stadia could be a viable option, or it just won’t be. There’s also the issue of how operators will treat game streaming platforms now that net neutrality regulations aren’t an issue. No one will want to pay extra to their operator just to use Stadia.

There’s a market for this but…

I’ll admit right away, I’m not in it. As a PC gamer who’s invested heavily in hardware and enjoys modding and also playing older games, the idea of a Netflix style service where games could be yanked out of my library at Google’s whims, or can’t benefit from mods or be played offline doesn’t appeal. But I do know people who this could be just right for, in theory.",,prosyscomtech,Singapore,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

But what do you expect/predict they'll do when it comes to streaming next gen(for Nintendo uproarious laughter is a valid response)? Google might have some sort of box but that's up in the air, could just be a service, like what xCloud might be, maybe? Amazon are probably working on something streaming based: because they've weren't adding enough fuel to GameStop's funeral pyre. Nvidia are still working away on something are far as I can tell. But what are your predictions, wild dreams and bare minimum expectations for our terrifying disc-less future where we have ever less control over what we actaully own and have rights to as consumers * looks for brown paper bag for hyperventilating into * Personally I think Mircosoft, Amazon and Google will go all in on streaming competing for the game everything anywhere market. Nintendo will continue to do Nintendo shit and make enough money to fuel a small country purely off of Pokemon-hardware-bundle sales. And Sony will offer a streaming service but i'll be less robust than the other options being focused on streaming to a console or TV while still selling a box(mid-tier PC) for premium gaming experiences. Basically MS, Amazon and Google all want to become the Netflix/Hulu/etc. for games, Sony wants to be the entire box office film industry turning a profit (just no Super Normal Profits) on AAA/Blockbusters and indie experiences best had as we currently do and Nintendo will keep selling Labos with DIY covers out of the back of a sedan at a flee market. ====================::==================== I think in general if other mediums are a sign, the way to play games will be broader but most ways will still exist. You can still buy movies and albums on discs, or download them. Despite the fact that both have very robust streaming options. As for who will win, I think the only thing that matters there is who can offer the best value for a monthly fee. If one of them manages to find that sweet spot between having relatively new games on their service without the service costing an arm and a leg. Whoever that may be is hard to predict. If the streaming services for the big consoles are just a complimentary way of playing some old games or less popular not-so-old games then I doubt it will push the needle much for anyone. Having only tried PSnow, it's fascinating on some level but the available games doesn't make me feel like it's even remotely a must-have. I might keep it around post trial period if only as a way of having access to odd games I would otherwise never buy. But that also in some ways feel like I am throwing money at Sony for a service that would in practice feel like I am paying for demos since I am not going to be invested enough in any game to actually spend quality time with them. That may also very well be my overall worry with a streaming future, that all games will feel less valuble and you end up jumping around and never sticking with any one game since you're getting that Netflix too-many-options stress and never commit to anything.",,Pezen,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Who Will Win The Streaming Wars?,,,

No disagreements there. Keyword, of course, being option. I just hate it whenever somebody mentions streaming, and all the tech journalist outfits start harping about how this time its for realz the end of consoles/pcs. I mean, we own so little of our entertainment as it is, so anything that reduces ownership even further is, imo, not something to look forward to. I think EA has the right idea. Subscription service, but let me DL/install the games to my machine. Perfect for those yearly titles or something where you know you really only want to play through the campaign and leave it. Steam: Sir Boors PSN: Sir_Boors It's a great time to be a nerd. ====================::==================== Quote: : ↑ Mar 23rd, 2019 3:23 pm Ya i don't see this ever fully converting people who are into owning hardware and that group will always exist if not remain the majority. I do think this can and will be successful in winning over people who are mildly interested in gaming but don't care about it enough to invest hundreds into the latest console or PC gaming hardware. I'm not sure what makes people think this will suddenly kill game ownership or reduce all games to cheap subscriptions. Publishers aren't going to suddenly give up making $80 per game to offer them for next to nothing in a subscription service. I think Stadia for the most part will just be an easier way to access games that will still be in that $60-80 per title range. See this is where I have some serious doubt. It costs a lot of money to set up and run a cloud service like this, at least in my eyes I don't think google (or anyone else that comes along) is going to be content with letting users use their service for a one time fee. This is why I have so many questions on how they are going to sell this, you can practically rule out physical media as an option here and I also think most games will be layered under some sort of subscription. Be it a subscription to use the service + traditional point of sale purchases or tiers of subscriptions that cover different types of games or maybe a rental type service where you pay a fee to use the game for 1 month. Having said that the movie industry has mostly transitioned to services that allow for one time purchases giving you the option to streaming wherever and whenever after the initial point of sale so it's not like its going to be completely unprecedented either if they go that route. Having said that I honestly think if this takes off its going to usher in some major changes in the way we buy and consume videogames. If games all start to fall under a blanket subscription model and game ownership is taken away from us to allow for services like this I think that honestly truly suck and hopefully there is an option to have it both ways, on the flipside with re-sales all but eliminated and the standard 60$ AAA game tag eliminated maybe developers can go back to the days where they just crafted amazing 8-10 hour story games without all the excessive filler that most AAA games have nowadays to pad the game length to give the perception of value. I do think Google is going to have an incredible tough time to gain footing here, if Microsoft and Sony launch a comparable service that leverages your existing game library and subscription services I don't see any reason why anyone would jump over to Google. That's not even an ""if"" at this point as Microsoft is set to release Xcloud later this year and Sony already has PSNow they would just need to open it up and improve upon it.",,SpicYMchaggis,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Google launches Stadia gaming service - Page 2,,,

Have off-site computers do much more intense physics calculations and stuff. Also ironically, render scenes for multiple players in couch co-op that a single console can't handle. Kind of ridiculous but I guess it makes sense. Me personally I'm not so excited, but I do foresee/anticipate/slightly dread that this is the future in the next 5-10 years. If streaming music and video are any indication, folks will always go to the lowest price point and if they can skip the hardware entirely, that's a big savings. But it's a real loss for physical media. And a real gamble that you'll be able to play the same games even a few years after they're launched. Not to mention what's gotta be a crazy amount of energy and upkeep to keep those systems rollin'. But I'm sure Microsoft will announce their own competitor at e3; and Sony's probably not far behind what with their PSNow stuff already. I did try the beta Project Stream with Assassin's Creed Odyssey. I wasn't terribly impressed. Image quality was OK on smaller laptop screens but looked like garbage on a bigger TV due to hella intense artifacting. The latency was tolerable for a game like Asscreed which already feels like walking in mud to me. I would NOT want to play a Mega Man or Spelunky on it. Anyway, the masses will probably tolerate it for their already-sluggish AAA games and the ability to say they're ""playing in 4k!"" even if it looks like trash. That's my cynical take. LOL. On the upside, we'll probably see some inventive new takes on genres that have been feeling a little stale and hey, if the price of entry if that low I'll probably try it out myself if something really appealing comes along. Hopefully the tech will improve enough over the next year or two that it actually feels like a local device.",,Toupee,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade."" Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft's xCloud, Apple's service is not cloud-based. The company also unveiled its new Apple TV+ service and a variety of exclusive original shows. https://archive.fo/7ANhX Looks like it's mostly indieshit with expected SJW bullshit or basically just a glorified app store+ but at least it's not streaming only yet . ====================::==================== LEGO | RED Games >The blocks will fly in this multiplayer brawler set in the LEGO universe.

GPU Miners May Soon Have Another Way to Make Money



GPU-based cryptocurrency miners have taken a beating throughout this bear market — just ask NVIDIA. However, users with spare GPUs may soon be able to put their ineffective mining hardware to another profitable use: renting rendering power to those looking to experience quality PC gaming on an underpowered computer. 

As reported by TechCrunch, Vectordash is looking to allow people with underpowered rigs not meant for gaming — such as Apple computers — to experience quality PC gaming with the help of individuals willing to rent their spare power for cloud rendering. This means that, in theory, even those with a Macbook Air could game at 4K resolution and 60 frames-per-second, given their internet bandwidth is capable of handling that amount of data.

If this sounds too good to be true, it’s not. Cloud rendering itself is nothing particularly new, so this idea is far from half-baked. Sony launched a cloud rendering service in PlayStation Now years ago — though it never really took off. Nevertheless, the company proved that cloud rendering is a viable option for gaming going forward.

Vectordash’s service will apparently run users $28 per month for cloud rendering capabilities. On the other side of the deal, GPU renters stand to make about $0.60 per day — which isn’t life-changing money for anyone who has the dough to throw at high-powered GPUs. However, the ability to put less-than-profitable meant-for-mining GPUs to work for another reason may help those who have been beaten down by both a bear market and dramatically more powerful ASIC mining rigs.



The key for Vectordash, of course, is offering payments for renters that are competitively priced with cryptocurrency mining returns — which shouldn’t be too difficult, given that GPU mining returns are currently negligible.

What do you think about Vectordash and cloud rendering PC games? Do you have GPUs you bought for cryptocurrency mining that you no longer use? Let us know in the comments below!

183511929260,3/17/2019,http://junyu-reads.tumblr.com/post/183511929260,"Google is making a big play in gaming next week, but we’re still unsure exactly what that entails. For years, the company has toyed with the idea of getting involved in what is now the biggest sector of the entertainment industry, worth an estimated $138 billion dollars as of last fall. And it would make competitive sense: Amazon owns Twitch, Facebook acquired Oculus, and Microsoft has Xbox. The only other major tech company without a serious gaming platform or investment of its own, not counting mobile app stores, is Apple, although even the iPhone maker is now rumored to be working on a game subscription service of its own.

Google has always had many of the pieces required to challenge the likes of Sony and Nintendo. The Android operating system is the most-used mobile software on smartphones around the world, while the Chrome browser and Chromecast streaming platform have given the company an easy way to run applications in real time and access television sets. It’s not hard to imagine an Android or browser-based gaming service that can let you play advanced software on a living room TV. 

But, until now, all we’ve seen are a few strong hints to what Google might be building. That changes on Tuesday of next week, when Google plans to hold its first-ever keynote at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. There’s been a lot of news over the past few months that gives us a good idea at what’s to come, but whatever Google does announce, it could have a big impact on an industry that is transforming how it builds, distributes, and sells games. Here’s a rundown what we know so far and what we think might be coming next week.

It’s highly likely it involves cloud gaming 

In teasing its GDC keynote, Google said it would unveil its “vision for the future of gaming.” And, going off numerous previous reports and public showings from the company itself, it’s highly likely the announcement involves a full-fledged cloud gaming service. More than a year ago, The Information first reported about Google’s Project Yeti, the codename for an internal division responsible for building a next-generation streaming service similar to existing but limited options like Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now. 

Even before Sony and Nvidia’s services existed, cloud gaming had been a bit like the industry’s holy grail: a just-out-of-reach ideal that has preoccupied a number of startups like OnLive, Gaikai, and others, but that’s never been cracked because the infrastructure and economics haven’t been properly worked out. 
Cloud gaming has been the industry’s holy grail for years 
The concept is relatively simple. What if, like Netflix and Spotify, you could not only digitally distribute games, but also stream them over the internet, so players wouldn’t need expensive hardware to play graphically-intensive titles? It’s difficult because games, unlike other forms of media, are both incredibly large in size and require real-time input from players. But it is doable, by wiring up the necessary hardware in a data center, running the game on a remote machine, and sending the video and receiving player commands over the internet. 

Regardless, it’s been impressive how many additional companies have revealed cloud gaming services in the past few years, turning what was once a niche experimental effort in an industry-wide race to figure out the future. Microsoft has gone public with its own game streaming platform, xCloud, that it plans to start testing later this year. EA, after acquiring the rental and cloud gaming service GameFly, is now working on a product of its own called Project Atlas. Even Verizon is getting into the game, with a test service up and running on Nvidia Shield set-top boxes. Earlier this week, Valve expanded its Steam Link service to turn it into a personal cloud gaming app. Both Amazon and Nintendo are looking into the technology, too.

There’s been a number of obvious signs that Google is indeed working on cloud gaming. Most prominently, Google launched its public test of Project Stream, an experimental game streaming technology that worked directly in its Chrome browser. Through a partnership with Ubisoft, Google let you play the brand-new Assassin’s Creed Odyssey — without needing to purchase the game — on pretty much any machine, given you had a strong enough internet connection. 
Google’s Project Stream test is an obvious sign of what’s to come 
It was a remarkable experiment, not just because it actually worked quite well, but also because a game studio as large as Ubisoft agreed to let one of its biggest launches of the year be a test subject. The test is now over, but Google set out to gather data from what it considered a “technical test to solve some of the biggest challenges of streaming,” data that could help inform whatever product it announces next week. 

There’s also been a lot of strategic hires in the past 18 months or so that hint toward a large, legitimate push into the gaming sector. Phil Harrison, a long-time executive of both Sony and Microsoft’s Xbox team, joined Google last year as a general manager and vice president, but working in an disclosed capacity. At the time, it was believed Harrison was going to help Google build out its virtual and augmented reality platforms as viable gaming businesses. But Harrison was also on the board of game streaming company Gaikai, a company acquired by Sony in 2012 and instrumental to the launch of its PlayStation Now service. So it’s likely Harrison is helping Google in its similar efforts. 

Later in the year, Google hired Jack Buser, who was a senior director at Sony’s game streaming unit and led the PlayStation platform’s social efforts before that. Shortly after, Google also hired Sony senior research engineer Richard Marks, who helped build the PlayStation VR headset and Move controller. 

I’m excited to finally be able to share that I have joined Google as VP!

And just last week, gaming industry veteran Jade Raymond also joined Google as a vice president, though we don’t what team or division she’ll be leading. The timing may not be coincidental. Raymond, who was executive producer and co-creator of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed and later joined Electronic Arts, could be heading up some type of creative division at Google, or one responsible for developer outreach given her connections at big studios and publishers.

There’s a hardware component, and it may involve Chromecast

We don’t have too much to go on regarding what this service might look like, but we do know that there’s a strong likelihood there is custom Google hardware involved. Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware and its senior vice president of devices, tweeted out a link to the GDC keynote earlier this week: 

Can’t wait for GDC 3 19 19! https://t.co/Ybjg31Yh2G
— Rick Osterloh (@rosterloh) March 12, 2019 
Osterloh oversees Pixel phones, Google Home devices, and the myriad other hardware products the search giant now produces in-house. Whether that means we’re getting a Pixel-branded cloud gaming console or something else entirely is unclear. But it’s interesting nonetheless to see Osterloh involved in some way. Kotaku’s Jason Schreier, who corroborated many of the initial details about Google’s upcoming service last summer, also reported that hardware will be one of three big components to the service, the other two being streaming and a massive in-house developer division that sounds very much like what Raymond could be involved in. 

If we had to speculate on what exactly a Google game-streaming platform look like, we don’t have to look too hard. That’s because it could very well already exist, at least in part, as Chromecast. Google’s streaming dongle is already capable of letting you play Android games on your TV using screen mirroring from a compatible smartphone.

Now, that’s not to say that this new game streaming platform will just piggyback off Chromecast. But Chromecast does provide a model for how Google might go about delivering gaming experiences to a TV. For one, it’s a no-frills package that plugs in through one port and stays out of the way. And because cloud gaming, like media streaming, doesn’t require a ton of local processing power, the hardware can be lightweight and cheap. Given the amount of buzz Google is creating here though, it seems more likely it’ll drop all-new hardware specifically for gaming. 

There could be a game controller to go with it

You can’t have console-quality gaming (if that is indeed what Google is going for) without some type of peripheral. For Google, that means building your own controller. According to a patent revealed late last week, that might be exactly what the company has done, with images showing off a Google-branded gamepad that like a cross between a PlayStation controller and the ill-fated Ouya’s gamepad from a half-decade ago. 
Image: Google 
This, even if Google doesn’t produce an actual console, might be why Osterloh’s hardware division is involved. For one, if Microsoft and Sony are building competing services, Google might not want its customers using other companies’ controllers. 

And it’s a no-brainer that a service of this type would need to be first-and-foremost a controller-centric experience. As it stands right now, any kind of cloud gaming service is probably going to have at least some issues with connectivity. The bar for console game performance is much lower than on PC, where competitive games require the best connections possible and even milliseconds of latency matter to hardcore players. 

In other words, this probably isn’t going to launch as a mouse-and-keyboard experience, at least not at first. So while we might not get Fortnite, Apex Legends, or Dota 2 on Google’s platform, there’s a good chance this service could very well be a place to play big-budget, single-player games like Assassin’s Creed. 
Image: Project Stream / Ubisoft 
Google could team up with Ubisoft and id Software for launch

If you needed more evidence that Google may bill its service as a destination for big single-player experiences, look at its list of early partners that will be in attendance and hosting sessions alongside the company at GDC. Google specifically calls out legendary shooter franchise Doom and its creator, Id Software, as one of its developer day session participants.

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » I haven't tried a game streaming service, so I'm kind of curious about the latency and speed of light issues that people were talking about. Is it something that makes tons of games simply unplayable for anyone who's ever gone into a settings menu, or does the latency just mean that you maybe don't get a good experience with the twitchiest games, like competitive shooters and fighting games? Armchair seemed to suggest that this would mostly only be useful for turn based games, but people indicated they were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey well enough, and it seems like PSNow has been doing it since 2014. Are streamed games just garbage to play over PSNow, or is it not as bad as all that? I played AC:O on Stream and it worked really well. I was using 100mbps wired Fios. I went in there specifically to test the latency and I'd say it matched my expectations of what a best-case scenario looks like for the tech. i.e. if you watch the screen closely as you press a button on the controller you'll definitely see it, and it's not my preference to sacrifice any input latency, but I could easily play the game that way and get used to it. A lamen player who isn't technical enough to be looking for latency probably would not notice it. That's on a controller though, using mouselook I really didn't like it. Even a casual player might notice the difference there compared to moving a mouse cursor on their computer. As I said before, KBAM is just objectively more precise than controllers can be. It's not a value judgement or a preference call when I say ""objectively more precise."" Think directional movements. With a keyboard, it's all or nothing. On or off. Controllers have far more granularity in left stick control than WASD, and it's there that you can get away with slightly slower control response because people just don't switch finger positions, they're moving a stick over a plane which can take time. Right stick controls are way less precise than a mouse. A mouse has a huge surface area it can move and nearly infinite different speeds, utilizing your entire arm for the movement, whereas sticks are just kind of a general thing that makes use of acceleration. Combine the two and input lag is fundamentally going to be more noticeable. Sure, I do agree that KB+M is incompatible with streaming except for the most casual of players. It would work okay for cursor-driven games with a client-rendered cursor, like RTSes, but that's about it. That said, KB+M is a dying breed - the only players who prefer that over a controller are the ones buying gaming PCs. So that doesn't worry me for the success of these services. Gaming PCs are resurging in recent years thanks to Twitch. It's not a dying breed, KBAM is on the rise if anything. It's what all the pros are using. Mechanical keyboards and excellent gaming mice are also coming out faster than I can keep track. Even the consoles are getting in on it. KB+M is quite the opposite of dying, not least as you can use it for document work or whatever when you ain't gaming. KB+M support on consoles is kind of an oddity, I would not say it's a rising trend. More of a thing for people who want to use their console on their desk as if it were a PC. Also anecdotally I think controller usage on PC has been on the rise for years compared to KB+M; increasingly more people are just switching to controllers full time because it's more comfortable and they can play in the living room. Shooters are becoming increasingly friendly towards controllers these days as they aim for crossplay like Fortnite. So you can expect to see more online shooters giving consideration for fairness by tweaking the auto-aim etc. Anyway I digress - yeah, PC gamers use KB+M for shooters more often than not. My point though is that those people aren't Stadia's audience - they have gaming PCs already, they have no use for streaming. Maybe in the future they could choose to switch to streaming rather than upgrade their PC, but if they do then they'll probably have to switch to using a controller.",,Zek,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,[Google Stadia] Stream all your games anywhere! 16,,,

Many people reporting on this also stated that companies like Nintendo are trying to go down this route in the future. And what was my reaction? I've hated the idea from the very beginning. Maybe it's something we will have to get used to, but I loathe the idea of not having my games nor my system in my possession. The fact that a data center is doing everything for me and I only own my controller and maybe a ""digital copy"" (i.e. a pass/subscription) to my gaming experience really bothers me. I mean, I'm the type of gamer who loves to have physical copies of my games, much like I have physical copies of my books. I want to be able to form a library as a collector and as someone who primarily games by myself. I also want to own my own hardware and hate the idea of needing to be connected to the internet when I'm gaming. Now, I can understand the positives of going cloud -- it increases the number of people who can conceivably play your games, removes the need to create hardware for every individual person, and removes the need for physical media. In other words, everything becomes cheaper to make and you have a larger consumer base (or so it seems). But will this really be the revolution of gaming for everyone? Netflix is doing well, sure, but watching movies and playing games are two totally different experiences. There is a massive difference between watching something and interacting with it, being immersed into it, and being a subculture. Can cloud based systems of the future really cater to the gaming world? Or is this yet another experiment that will fail miserably, because it really doesn't understand how gamers think, interact, and understand the world of their hobby? Let's discuss. ====================::==================== Who says Nintendo is going this route?

I can't see a game like doom eternal being in a subscription, unless big bucks are changing hands. Will you own the game? Will you rent it? I suspect streaming could get big in Japan, but America and Europe will be much harder to make an impact in. And what of vr if consoles are on the way out? We haven't even got wireless vr, let alone streaming. ====================::==================== That's what psnow is tbf. @aaron9992000",,WinnieP michelle_tabor,Netherlands,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,Stadia,,,

Stadia is planned for launch this year and allows you to stream games across a variety of devices with very little friction. It could be a very big deal for gaming going forward. The platform aims to bring together playing, spectating, and developing games onto a single platform. As an example, you could view Assassin's Creed Odyssey on YouTube and then begin playing it through streaming in ""as little as five seconds."" Things like game updates and patches and system requirements are effectively a non-issue, because the game is running on Google's servers, rather than your local device. Google VP Phil Harrison promised the technology will work across desktops, laptops, TV, tablets, and phones. In a demonstration, the same demo was seen working across a Chromebook, smartphone, tablet, and TV, the latter through a Chromecast Ultra HDMI streamer. At launch it will stream in 4K at 60 FPS with surround sound and HDR support, and in the future Google is planning to support 8K resolution and frame-rates upwards of 120 FPS. Harrison also promised that the platform will embrace cross-platform play. You'll be able to use existing controllers on laptops and PCs, and Google will offer its own Stadia controller. The Google Stadia controller links to whichever device you're playing on, and it sports a dedicated Google Assistant button for referencing walkthrough videos if you get stuck. Gamespot . Another Gamespot article says that it doesn't work very well, even on a 20Mbps connection. ====================::==================== Quote: : No thanks. Aside from it not performing well, it's Google; they'll abandon it after a few years for a new project. Yea, the idea that you can stream 4K games at 60 fps is kinda absurd. If that was possible, Microsoft and Sony would already be doing it because it opens up their entire library of older games for subscription services. Sony already has PlayStation Now (Which I don't know much about). When you hear that DOOM didn't really work and Assassin's Creed was only OK, it's like why bother? You can just buy the game and play it locally if you want. They think that these streaming ""services"" will be the next big thing, but honestly if they are going to go that route, why not just let you pay for the service and download the full game to your hard drive? Then it will play perfectly and they can still get the monthly fee out of you.",,Evil Avatar,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,Google Announces Streaming Game Platform Stadia,,,

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior?

Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » I haven't tried a game streaming service, so I'm kind of curious about the latency and speed of light issues that people were talking about. Is it something that makes tons of games simply unplayable for anyone who's ever gone into a settings menu, or does the latency just mean that you maybe don't get a good experience with the twitchiest games, like competitive shooters and fighting games? Armchair seemed to suggest that this would mostly only be useful for turn based games, but people indicated they were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey well enough, and it seems like PSNow has been doing it since 2014. Are streamed games just garbage to play over PSNow, or is it not as bad as all that? I played AC:O on Stream and it worked really well. I was using 100mbps wired Fios. I went in there specifically to test the latency and I'd say it matched my expectations of what a best-case scenario looks like for the tech. i.e. if you watch the screen closely as you press a button on the controller you'll definitely see it, and it's not my preference to sacrifice any input latency, but I could easily play the game that way and get used to it. A lamen player who isn't technical enough to be looking for latency probably would not notice it. That's on a controller though, using mouselook I really didn't like it. Even a casual player might notice the difference there compared to moving a mouse cursor on their computer. As I said before, KBAM is just objectively more precise than controllers can be. It's not a value judgement or a preference call when I say ""objectively more precise."" Think directional movements. With a keyboard, it's all or nothing. On or off. Controllers have far more granularity in left stick control than WASD, and it's there that you can get away with slightly slower control response because people just don't switch finger positions, they're moving a stick over a plane which can take time. Right stick controls are way less precise than a mouse. A mouse has a huge surface area it can move and nearly infinite different speeds, utilizing your entire arm for the movement, whereas sticks are just kind of a general thing that makes use of acceleration. Combine the two and input lag is fundamentally going to be more noticeable. Sure, I do agree that KB+M is incompatible with streaming except for the most casual of players. It would work okay for cursor-driven games with a client-rendered cursor, like RTSes, but that's about it. That said, KB+M is a dying breed - the only players who prefer that over a controller are the ones buying gaming PCs. So that doesn't worry me for the success of these services. Gaming PCs are resurging in recent years thanks to Twitch. It's not a dying breed, KBAM is on the rise if anything. It's what all the pros are using. Mechanical keyboards and excellent gaming mice are also coming out faster than I can keep track. Even the consoles are getting in on it.

183571722814,3/19/2019,http://asadiwebnet.tumblr.com/post/183571722814,"Google can earn a lot of money from video games, the best example being the profit from Google Play. However, the very creation of games and platforms associated with it - here the technological giant moves like an elephant in a porcelain store. Google Stadia is theoretically a great solution that will break into reality like water on rocks. 

 OnLive, PlayStation Now, Remote Play, Jump, GeForce NOW - what links all initiatives related to streaming games? Mainly that none of them was successful, what the producers counted on. Even giants like Sony and Nvidia did not offer the service at the appropriate level. Not because they could not. They could not do it. The biggest problem of streaming is not a company or server room. The user is the bottleneck of the service. Customer. Player. 

 Google Stadia is to provide a streaming FHD / 4k image at 60 frames per second. 

 Alphabet can use for this purpose the best server rooms, the most powerful units and the highest bandwidth. But what about these NAJ, if the player receives the picture via his own, not always ideal network infrastructure. Sure, people with a fiber optic led to the apartment will play in relatively comfortable conditions (for the impressions from natural, native 1080p, however, do not count). But what about all those that Vectra and UPC did not reach? 



 The network infrastructure of each country is a mixture of fiber optics, copper cables, radio waves and white spots. In the very center of Warsaw there are still places where you can not count on a faster connection than 10 Mbps. Some families are doomed to radio or LTE. In terms of access to the network, Poland is still one of the leaders. Where the cable infrastructure was laid earlier, today it is in an archaic state. Whoever tried to order a technician from the Internet in Rome knows exactly what I am writing about. 

 Google Stadia depends on what local providers of telecommunications services have to offer. The best server seems to be useless when there is a network with a considerable delay or insufficient transmission at home. This is a problem that no technology company has ever dealt with. Many great compression methods have been created for the streamed image, but none of them are confusingly similar to the native FHD standard. What to write about 4K. Small screens of smartphones and tablets slightly lose these streaming imperfections, but Google wants to run the Smart TV stage after all! 

 Google Stadia is the preview of the new gaming platform … without games. 

 To convince someone to buy a product or service, you need to have something original. Something your own. Something that competitors can not boast about. Sony knows that by creating exclusive games for PlayStation. Nintendo knows it, nurturing its own brands. Netflix knows it and knows HBO GO, producing their own movies and series. It also knows Spotify, fighting for temporary release discs. Google Stadia is proof that Alphabet still does not understand. 



 During the GDC 2019 conference, we learned that Google had just set up the first studio to produce video games. Not bad. It’s just that Sony has a dozen or so of them. Microsoft likewise. Considering that the average video game production cycle lasts 3 to 5 years, the first exclusive game for Google will debut … somewhere in 2021? In spite of this Stadia debuts already in 2019. If the Alphabet does not secure the premiere of several titles for temporary exclusivity thanks to sacks with money (or rather will not secure), it will look pale. 

 I really understand that exclusive games will not be the main strength of the new solution. I know that it is about universality and accessibility. A beautiful thing. Jump into the virtual world where your beloved streamer is located is the opportunity on which Google wants to build the popularity and uniqueness of the Stadia. The problem is that most streamers … broadcast on a competitive Twitch. YouTube Gaming, what would not be talking about this section, did not achieve such success as Twitch and it will not appeal again. 

 Sure, on YT also creates the mass of popular person. However, their materials usually produce complexes from A to Z. Deprived of live interaction. No possibility to play together with an online idol. As a result, Google Stadia loses much of its magic and attractiveness. You can write here - okay, but you’ll see a trailer for a new, hot YouTube hit and tick, you’re moving in 5 seconds to the game . - The problem is that: 

 *  trailers usually appear before the premiere of the game, so I will not launch any program because it has not been released yet. 
 *  publishers will probably first sell games traditionally, and only later will grant Google licenses. If so, I will go to the store because I do not want to wait. 
 Google Stadia is a beautiful vision. Just like Google+, Allo, Inbox and Glass OS. 

 I accept betting on when the Alphabet will obey. 2021? 2022? Probably not earlier. First, the giant will fight a bit. It will lower the price of the subscription. Will distribute free trial periods. But what about the free trial for the person that YouTube automatically starts with 720p? What about a subscription promotion for a player who connects to the Internet via an unreliable radio network? Google Stadia is a service that can be the best in the world. However, even this will not make the link in my apartment magically better, and the streamed FHD will look like native 1080p.

To me that's a totally different situation from Google trying to gain audience by offering a service where you can get all brand new games from all major publishers many of which don't have a problem making $60 per physical and digital sale. If they're going to successfully attract games from those publishers to Stadia then a subscription model of any kind makes no sense to me. Publishers like Rockstar and Activision who break records make a billion dollars a year or whatever selling individual copies aren't going to ever put their games on a blanket subscription service. The only way those games show up on Stadia is by Google giving them the ability to match what they make on current platforms. Game Pass and EA Access are not streaming services though. You can download the games and play them as long as your subscription is active but its all being done locally. They were designed for the exact reason you described. The barrier for entry here is so low that it will attract people that can't or are unwilling to drop 200+$ on a console. In that sense its not really trying to compete with XB1 and PS4 but trying to find a market that hasn't been tapped yet. PSNow is the only comparison we have. It's been around for years and the only way to use that service is a costly subscription. You cannot buy games off this service. If it It costs money to the provider every time someone even opens a game, I don't envision a scenario where they eat that cost after the initial point of sale. I'm not saying google will require an expensive subscription that covers all games ala PSNOW but I think at a minimum it will require some sort of subscription to use the service. I can't think of a single instance outside of movies where something reliant on the cloud in this capacity isn't tied to some subscription model and I'd be surprised if Stadia isnt any different. I think when these services all get up and running pricing is going to be extremely messy. I imagine we'll see a bunch of tiered subscriptions that covers the gauntlet from a basic subscription that'll allow you to play a few games that google is showcasing in the service and maybe give you access to buy/own/rent the rest of the games in the catalog at your request to a costly deluxe subscription that will give you access to all the games on the service and a bunch of tiers in between.",,SpicYMchaggis,Canada,Alberta,Calgary,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

It also seemed to do even better when I played and beat Mega Man 9 and Darksiders Warmastered edition. I think the main problem with PSNow, once you have it set up right, is their servers, possible not being well optimized and not having enough space for people when you get a lot of people playing when it does have problems. Most likely Google will have this smoothed out. So basically, for better or worse, this stuff is going to come to fruition this year like they announced in a working form, and will probably have some pretty major impacts within a gen (the next five years or so). Even at 30 fps this stuff would have a major impact, since though 60 fps is good, it's overrated to an extent since even fighting games are able to be played decent enough using it.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Wait so if I paid £19.99 for my years subscription I could play FIFA for free?

183572868021,3/19/2019,http://slimgigs.tumblr.com/post/183572868021,"After weeks of teasing a Game Developers Conference presentation, Google has finally outlined its vision for the future of video games. During a GDC 2019 keynote, the company announced Stadia, a platform built on streaming games live through the cloud. It’s a very different kind of platform, not tied to a console box or PC, but it already has recognizable qualities like its own controller and first-party development studio. Read on for all the details about the controller, release window, and everything else we know so far.

Where Did This Come From?

The GDC keynote presentation began with Google CEO Sundar Pichai talking about how the company has been experimenting with streaming game technology for several years. He explained how the goal is to essentially create a streamlined experience where you can play on any device at any time, without any of the hassle. This is also when he announced the name of the platform.

Is It A Console?

Stadia is not a console–nor is it tied to any specific hardware. Unlike a traditional console, Stadia isn’t tied to a specialized box in your home or your hands. Instead, it streams the game data to any platform with an internet connection. That means you can play high-fidelity games through anything from a mobile phone to a Chromebook. You can play on your TV, too, through a Chromecast Ultra HDMI streamer.

The decentralized nature of Stadia is a major feature of the platform, and the one Google has built most of its new product features around. It’s set to launch in 2019, with more release details coming this summer.

Stadia Controller

On a PC you can play Stadia through existing supported controllers. Google is also releasing its own specialized Stadia controller, pictured below. The Stadia controller has a few extra features built to work with the platform: smart device detection, a share button, and a Google Assistant button.

Is There A Price? Does It Work Like Netflix?

Nope. At this point, Google has focused primarily on showcasing what Stadia is capable of–both the fact that it works and the types of features that it enables. It has not at all broached the subject of how much it will cost. Maybe even more importantly, we don’t know if you’ll buy games directly, buy limited-time access to games, subscribe to a Netflix-style subscription, or some combination of these.

In an interview with GameSpot, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot suggested that all of these pricing options are on the table. “I think we will have a multitude of ways,” he said. “Either you buy full price and you play; or you will be able to also register, possibly, to play either one hour or two hours a day. There will be plenty of ways.”

What Can It Do?

Stadia is built around the natural advantages of being a streaming platform. For example, Google showed seamless switching between various devices, similar to Nintendo Switch’s different play modes. This also means that games can be played at high fidelity regardless of the device. At launch it will stream in 4K at 60 FPS with surround sound and HDR support, and in the future Google is planning to support 8K resolution and frame-rates upwards of 120 FPS.

Since the actual rendering is being done through a server farm, developers are encouraged to take advantage of the extra processing power. One tech demo showed real-time destructible environments. Another showed a multiplayer game that fed several video feeds into a single player’s stream.

Two consumer-facing features, State Share and Crowd Play, are aimed at encouraging interaction between friends, or between streamers and audiences. State Share lets you create moments for friends or stream viewers to play from exactly the same point in a game. Crowd Play lets streamers form a queue of viewers who can jump in and play a multiplayer game with them.

What Are The Games?

Though the presentation was ostensibly for a dedicated gaming platform, Google has not yet announced very many games. Id Software’s Marty Stratton appeared on stage to promise Doom Eternal will come to Stadia, and Q Games Dylan Cuthbert suggested he’s working on a game built around the State Share feature. Tequila Works’ Luz Sancho appeared on stage, but did not commit to a specific game project.

Former EA and Ubisoft studio head Jade Raymond is also heading up the newly formed Stadia Games and Entertainment division, which will create first-party games. The studio will also work with third-party developers to help use the technology.

Ubisoft is also likely on-board, having helped test the Project Stream platform last year that served as a test bed for Stadia.

Why Is Cloud Gaming A Big Deal?

Cloud gaming isn’t new by any means; PlayStation Now, for instance, has been around for a while. But we’re finally reaching the point at which it stands to become a more significant component of how games are distributed. That doesn’t necessarily mean cloud gaming will replace consoles and dedicated hardware, as it could be a matter of complementing those things. To get you up to speed, we’ve put together an explainer on why cloud gaming is the future.

Who’s The Competition?

As noted above, PlayStation Now already exists, and Microsoft just recently showcased its xCloud streaming technology, with Forza Horizon 4 being played on a phone. Microsoft also announced plans to begin public testing this year. To help you keep track of all this, we’ve assembled a list of the top companies in the cloud gaming space. There are more than you likely realize.

183600284295,3/20/2019,http://eduardobutton.tumblr.com/post/183600284295,"We’re in the era of convenience, which is why we’re seeing megacorps like Google coming up with their own gaming solution that is ostensibly more convenient and easier to use. Unanswered questions leave some doubt that increased convenience doesn’t come with its own share of inconveniences. I talked about how Google Stadia looks flashy, but might have some glaring issues in practice. I’m not here to talk about the streaming future again. One of the biggest barriers I see for Google Stadia is brand loyalty, as companies like Sony have players firmly invested in their ecosystem.

As we move into next-gen, the one thing I want more than anything is backwards compatibility… kind of. What I really want is Sony to move to a system where my PSN account moves with me wherever I go. If I buy Sekiro on my PS4, I don’t want to lose that purchase just because I move forward to a PS5, and I don’t necessarily want to have to keep all my old consoles in order to play old games. I guess what I am looking for is a combination of Google’s all-streaming future and the dedicated console boxes we’ve become used to.

I’m not sure I’ve completely bought into Google’s idea of an ethereal gaming network tied only to my account. I need that safety and security of a home base—a central hub to call home and allow me capabilities offline. I want the PlayStation 5. But I also want the boundaries of the console to break, allowing my PSN account to move with me to other places. I want to be able to interact with my gaming even when I don’t have the PS5 on.

But Microsoft is Doing it!

In somewhat unprecedented news today, it was revealed that Cuphead, the previous Xbox/PC exclusive, is coming to the Nintendo Switch. Now, Microsoft’s been playing nice with Nintendo. They want to key into that “consoles as a service” future that we all know is coming. What’s brilliant about their scheme is that Cuphead on Switch will actually unlock Xbox Achievements. You’ll be able to sign into your Xbox Live account from a Nintendo device.

When I think about my gaming history, so much of it has been stored on my PSN ID, from my first trophy more than 10 years ago to just streaming Sekiro earlier today. I can’t easily throw away a decade of history and dedication to a platform just for a chance at ethereal convenience, but I’d love it if that ethereal convenience could be added onto my current profile. If I’ve got the PS5 console as a fallback and an anchor, I’ll gladly embrace a digital and cloud-based future. I’d love to boot up games (or even partner apps) on my phone to work on grinding or other little things while away. It’d be awesome to be able to play a game I own on my PSN account through a browser on my laptop if I am away from home. And then at the end of a long day or even longer week, it would feel good to just come home, lay back on the couch, and boot up the PS5 to see all of that progress and activity linked to one place.

I want my PSN account to live both in the cloud and directly on my console. If we want to talk about the era of convenience, then let’s start talking about redundancies and backups. Rather than taking the enormous leap that Google wants to take to the future of the gaming space, I want to evolve the current landscape to support both what I’ve become used to as well as the benefits of that cloud and digital future. That’s the best way to instill comfort in change, and Microsoft proved that trying to make too drastic of a leap would be met with a strong resistance. You don’t drop the frog into boiling water. You slowly turn up the heat.

Sony’s Smart, and They’re Planning Something

No PSX 2018. No Sony at E3 2019. Sony’s got something up their sleeve, and the fewer places they appear, the less likelihood there is that there plans will leak or their message will be misconstrued, whenever they are ready to deliver it. Remember how Sony responded to the Xbox One reveal? Their own E3 showing later that same year was full of direct jabs at what Microsoft was doing, all while giving the player more of what they wanted. That didn’t mean that Sony wasn’t innovating. It just meant that Sony’s messaging was far more focused on the player than on massive leaps and innovation.



Sony’s been keeping up in the cloud/streaming space. They were one of the first consoles to offer community and sharing functionality (now standard across almost every current gen platform). They bought up Gaikai almost seven years ago and have been running PlayStation Now as a veritable Netflix for games for years. Google’s idea isn’t new, it’s just bombastic and flashy. Sony’s got something better though: a preexisting gaming ecosystem.

When Sony is ready to deliver their message, I hope we see responses as smartly crafted as the “how to share games” meme with Shuhei Yoshida and Adam Boyes. They need to hammer home why something like Google Stadia just might not be worth leaving PlayStation for, while also offering up innovation of their own. I hope that innovation is a continued investment in PSN accounts and our gaming histories. I hope that my digital library gets to stay with me as I move forward on platforms. I hope that they’ll give me new ways to interact and engage with my gaming experience beyond the console. I just want to take my PSN account with me everywhere I go—into the future and onto other platforms. To me, that would be the ultimate convenience.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.

Lag makes any games that require twitch reactions unplayable, artifacting is notable in busy/fast scenes. having to sometimes queue to start a game is frustrating and being booted off if you're inactive for a short period of time is annoying. The biggest problem of all is that if my internet goes out the service is literally impossible to use. None of these are issues if I just play a game on my physical PS3/4 and unfortunately the solution to a lot of these problems lies in a countries internet infrastructure which is out of Sony's hands.",,Sevalle013,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I live in Australia, so unfortunately Stadia will not be available at launch here. For context, we still do not have access to PlayStation Now, which does not bode well for getting Stadia anytime soon. Without having any expertise, I believe this is a combination of our slow internet for the majority of the country combined with our geographic location putting us further away from data centres. Potentially, dedicated Stadia data centres will need to be built here (I assume dedicated gaming data centres don't exist here yet), which is a significant investment for a relatively small market compared to US/Europe. Even for countries where it will launch this year, I am sure internet speeds vary dramatically from location to another. This will limit people's ability to use Stadia, despite the fact it is technically launched in their country. I guess the conversation I want to have is that Google has pitched Stadia as connecting gaming communities like never before, but there may be massive technological barriers that individuals all around the world can not overcome. Do you think Google as a company can overcome these issues with their own solutions, or will cloud gaming be exclusive to what I would say is the minority of the international market who have access to high speed internet?",,stig4020,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Rami Ismail @tha_rami *everything in the industry is more-and-more focused on providing maximum benefit and exposure for infinite online experiences* ""Why doesn't anyone make singleplayer games with no F2P and a start and end anymore"" Listen, here's why - generalized: - People expect low prices for one-time expenses - Streamers play one-time experiences only as long as there's content - People in 2019 play less games for longer time - Storefronts decide popularity by playtime - Updates are huge marketing ops Add all that together, and it's easy to see why a developer might go 'well, let's go Games As A Service', why marketing might go 'well, let's go GAAS', why financial might go 'well, let's go GAAS', and why shareholders might go 'well, let's go GAAS'. Anyways, in case you're wondering why I've always rejected the idea that ""more hours = better game"", this is what ""more hours"" looks like as an industry goal. I hope we can build sustainable models for both that don't require being effectively first party or Rockstar/CDPR. There's a ton more this ripples into or from (including studios closing, layoffs, marketing & PR, stock expectations, early access, patching, narrative structures, etc. etc) but I'll leave those for some other day. A lot is shifting, and not everyone had stable footing to start. Anyway, I love some GAAS (Hi, Destiny, Anthem, etc) & I love some GAA...P? Games as a Product? I don't know.

Just saying they are, is all. ionward � � � � � � @pybro when people ask that rarely is it an actual question; we know they do it for what boils down to money. we’re not idiots. asking why is mostly just venting frustration. Pino @ Belvcon @pinotorious It's not just profit though, making single player games at the quality levels people tend to expect are extremely expensive endeavors, and it's difficult to recoup that cost without some other revenue stream. It's my favorite kind of game, but it's hard to justify. A Long, Disappointed Sigh @megamandrn001 Is it though? Undertale became a national sensation based entirely on the strength of its characters and story, done by one dude. Stardew Valley as well. Doing single player games with massive budgets that do little new and have awful writing are a hard sell, yes. Pino @ Belvcon @pinotorious Twitter isn't a great place to discuss this, but two outlier games does not a business plan make. A Long, Disappointed Sigh @megamandrn001 The indie scene isn't because it's a loose confederation of dreamers and hobbyists. The scene rose specifically because the industry at large refused to meet a demand. It refused to innovate and lessen budgets. Pino @ Belvcon @pinotorious There are too many things going against a shortish solo experience. Youtube, Let's Plays, twitch streams, piracy, reselling. It's very hard to make money with that stuff in AAA these days. So games like the Uncharted franchise are a hard sale these days? There are different expectations with console-only games as they drive sales of said console and those subscriptions. For example, in this case Naughty Dog is owned by Sony, so whether they make a profit on the game itself or not, they're gonna profit in other ways. Uncharted 4 for example was PS4's 3rd bestselling game ever, but even that is just 8.7M units. Did it turn a profit? Sure, but not a huge one on the game itself. God of War for all it's accolades sold just 5M copies. Did it turn a profit after development and marketing costs? Probably not. Maybe it broke even. But again, you can get away with those numbers on a console-only game as they make up for that in PS4 sales, PSPlus & PSNow subscriptions. So in the case of companies like EA (who are multiplatform), their profits are tied to the game itself.",,hrungr,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Does a GaaS HAVE to have Multiplayer?,,,

183567808939,3/19/2019,http://aresworld-universe.tumblr.com/post/183567808939,"Imagine a world where you don’t need expensive gaming hardware to play the next big release – a world where all you have to do is open the Chrome browser, pick out a game you want to play and instantly have it start without any need for a lengthy download or surprisingly large patch. 

That’s the idea of Google’s cloud gaming service, Stadia. From Chrome tab to 4K, 60fps game, in five seconds. No installation. That’s what’s being promised here, and it could be a game-changer.

Rather than needing high-end hardware, Stadia (which was prototyped under the Project Stream moniker) allows you to use whatever computer you have around to play video games. Google handles all the heavy lifting on its own servers, which can process the latest version of the game at high resolutions and frame rates, encode it into a stream, and deliver the stream to you over the internet.

We got our first taste of the service during an extended beta that ran back in 2018, and now it’s been fully revealed at GDC 2019. 

There’s still much to learn as Google’s Stadia rolls out, but based on what we played last year, the renamed Project Stream serves as an impressive showcase of what the future of cloud gaming could look like.



How Google Stadia works

As long as you’re connected to the internet with a fast and stable connection and you’re using a recent desktop version of the Chrome browser, you’ve got the setup needed to use Stadia. 

Playing a video game on Stadia is as simple as opening a new tab in Chrome and going to the service’s homepage.  

Google will prompt you to run a connection test that checks your internet bandwidth, the latency between your computer and the servers, and any data loss. Google requires a streaming rate of 15Mbps, latency below 40ms, and data loss below 5%. With these requirements met, you’ll be ready to dive into a game.

The beta of Project Stream offered Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, which is nothing short of a demanding title. When you launched the game in your Chrome tab, it would go fullscreen, and run exactly as if it has been launched on a proper gaming computer (except without a deep graphics settings menu). You can play with a keyboard and mouse or connect a game controller and play that way.



All of your inputs on the computer get sent over to Google’s servers, processed in the game, and everything happening gets streamed right back to you. This is why that latency is so important, because you can’t have a good game experience if everything you do in the game shows up a second later.

The limits of Stadia are still being detailed, but Google has stated that Stadia will eventually be able to scale up to 8K / 60fps frame rates, with 4K play as the norm. That’s way above the standard bar for quality PC gaming. 

All of your inputs on the computer get sent over to Google’s servers, processed in the game, and everything happening gets streamed right back to you.

So, in effect, you’re opening a new tab that pipes all your inputs to a high-end gaming PC that streams back the visuals and audio to your computer screen. This system is simpler than some others, which set you up with a virtual desktop that then remotely runs Steam, Origin, Battle.net, or what have you.

In the case of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on Stadia, you are still required to log into a Ubisoft account to play, but beta testers aren’t required to own the game.



Stadia will also work with Google Chromecast – you’ll be able to stream its games straight to any TV using Google’s streaming dongle, not to mention phones and computers. 

You’ll be able to use keyboard and mouse or a gamepad to play Stadia, and Google’s Stadia gamepad, a brand new piece of hardware, seems particularly smart. First off, the issue of latency – the gamepad itself connects directly to Google’s cloud, which take a few of the steps out the data transfer chain, reducing the lag between your inputs being registered by the game. It also has a dedicated Google Assistant button, which Google claims will be loaded up with information on the title you’re playing, offering tips when needed.

It’ll also support cross-platform multiplayer – so long as the other major game players want to take part, of course.

It’s unclear at this point whether Google will require players to buy games and pay for the streaming service in separate transactions, or whether access to select games will be bundled into the service.

What games will be available on Stadia?

Through the Project Stream beta, the only available game was Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. While this didn’t give us much idea of what games Google will offer in the future, it did give us a good idea of what games Google’s Stadia could be capable of offering. 

For a 1080p 30fps game experience at High settings in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Ubisoft recommends a system with the following specs:

 * OS: Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only)
 * Processor: AMD FX-8350 @ 4.0 GHz, Ryzen 5 - 1400, Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.5 GHz
 * Video: AMD Radeon R9 290 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 (4GB VRAM or more with Shader Model 5.0) or better
 * Memory: 8GB RAM
 * Video Preset: High
 * Storage: 46GB available hard drive space
 * DirectX: DirectX June 2010 Redistributable
 * Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card with latest drivers
For 4K at 30fps and high settings, the recommended specs bump up to include 16GB of RAM, a more powerful AMD Ryzen 1700X or Intel Core i7 7700 processor, and a beefier AMD Vega 64 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. With Stadia streaming in video, this limitation could be eradicated, bringing AAA gaming to even entry level laptops.

If the service can handle Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 1080p 60fps, Stadia is going to be capable of playing a whole lot of games at these settings. Other major titles could easily see support on the service.

Games with a major online focus may have dicier prospects on Stadia. Since competitive online games are often fast-paced and require split-second reaction times, the extra latency introduced by streaming will likely be an issue for serious competitors. But Stadia looks better placed to beat this issue than other similar services, with infrastructure that no-one else has in terms of fibre optic cabling, and a Wi-Fi controller that connects directly to Google’s cloud.

A recent Chromium update also added support for Nintendo Switch controllers to Google’s browser, so it looks like we could be getting more than just streams of PC releases.



What was Project Stream like to use?

At its best, Project Stream was good. At its worst, well, Google won’t let you play below a certain threshold of quality, and you wouldn’t want to anyway.

We tested Project Stream on varying setups. We played on an unstable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection, a fast and nearby 5GHz Wi-Fi connection, and on an ethernet connection held steady and offered high bandwidth. Keep in mind this was without the dedicated hardware Google has now introduced.

The highly dated Chromebook hardware didn’t hold it back from playing.

We also played on a 5-year-old Chromebook, a 2-year-old Razer Blade, and a modern desktop gaming rig that would be happy to run Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 1080p/60FPS on its own hardware. We even started one computer up while another was running the stream, and Google simply transferred control over to the second computer, with no stop in the stream.

Across the board, we’d describe the experience as at least playable. The highly dated Chromebook hardware didn’t hold it back from playing. The biggest issues come from a bad connection: if the connection speed drops, so does the game quality, with lower resolutions, latency, and far more noticeable compression. 

That said, in our experience, the visual degradation came before the latency, so we were able to continue battling enemies smoothly even if they started to look like ghostly swarms of pixels.

Overall, the graphics were fairly good throughout, especially when playing on a high-bandwidth connection using ethernet cables. Colors, shadows, and anti-aliasing look fine, and the frame-rate seems to vary between 30 and 60fps.



The low frame-rate was one of the two issues we noticed. The other was compression. Most of the time, it’s not super jarring, but when there’s a lot of detail in a scene and a lot of movement, the compression turns it all into a bit of slop. Character faces become a blur and hard edges (noticeably the character’s hair) go soft. Will Stadia have fixed these issues by launch?

It would seem to be a sign of the lower bitrate enabling this type of streaming, but the truth is that most of the time it’s unnoticeable, and would be even harder to spot if you weren’t looking for it (we were looking for it). Panning the camera and running through dense wooded areas in the game (and combining the two) were the only times we were turned off by the dips in visual quality.

The experience isn’t mind-blowing, at least until you remember that it’s using so little of your computers processing power that you’ve literally got a full-system virus scan going in the background and nothing changed. The visuals are comparable to what you’d get on a console, except with compression artifacts here and there. And, with a stable connection, it compares rather favorably to in-home streaming on a Steam Link.

While the price and service model Google adopts will go a long way in determining whether Stadia is worthwhile, we can say right now that its prototype works, and it looks good doing it. But, will Microsoft’s xCloud do it better?

If the controller inputs are streamed over WiFi to the Stadia servers, then it sends the video with your inputs to a display, does this negate some of the input/display lag? This could be a good thing for VR if they can also stream inputs from VR headsets and controllers. I'm hoping someone with more knowledge can shed some light on this. ====================::==================== @mikewhy : I went over to my brothers for vacation after he got a new TV, played some Destiny on it and everything felt off in comparison to my home setup. I later see a movie playing on it and can easily see he had the ""soap opera"" mode on, i switched it to game mode the next time i played some Destiny and played perfectly fine after that. He also plays games so im not sure how he didn't notice the input lag, other then ""well that's how its always been so that's how it must play"" I used PlayStation Now when it was in beta, it was ""good enough"" and perfectly fine for the most part, but there was still a little lag and compression when compared to playing directly off my PS3. If i didn't already own a PS3 and a large portion of the streaming library i would consider paying a monthly/yearly fee even with some of those cons. But Stadia is different in that its hardware is not locked, which comes with some benefits over just streaming fixed console hardware over the internet. And as far as VR i probably wouldn't try that over internet. the input lag being one problem, and the 60fps Stadia is promoting when 80+ is the recommended for not getting motion sickness in VR is the other. End of the day as some have said its still streaming over the internet, so lag spikes and input latency are going to be a thing, its more of is it ""good enough"" like what the crew said during the stream?

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,lunartailsteffi,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller.

The monthly service fee would be divided amongst the games in the service based on how much time is spent in each game. The service would likely focus on paid games rather than the popular free-to-play genre. Bloomberg isn't certain the service will debut Monday but Apple has certainly cleared the way for a focus on new services for the event. Earlier this week, Apple quietly debuted new AirPods , iMacs , and iPads . Article Link: Apple 'Netflix for Games' Subscription Service May Be Shown Monday Click to expand... Yet another subscription.. Yeah yeah.. no one's forcing us to subscribe.. I get that. I just find the amount of subscriptions 'regular' people have is insane. I asked around in my circle and everyone said anything from 5-8 monthly digital subscriptions. Ridiculous. How many do you guys have? ====================::==================== You stream game executables to save install space. You try to save install space because of bandwidth limits on initial downloads, and limited local storage capacity. You stream game visual to run the executable on different hardware. The first is really stupid and is a solved by expendable local storage. Even console makers figured that out. Even Nintendo knows, and has included SD-Card expansion since the Wii. The second is a bit more understandable. Especially if you don't want to release propertary Emulation code, which is what PlayStation Now mainly does. Or if that emulator takes more power than the local hardware could support. So what is Apple's plan with a Game Streaming? Are they looking to do #1 or #2? If #1 they are admitting they have a storage and installation of problem with large (high quality asset, possiblity VR) games. If #2 they are admitting their phones can't handle the processing load of higher end games, which wouldn't be surprising but since Apple still doesn't gaming as serious business.",,Dorje Sylas,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Apple 'Netflix for Games' Subscription Service May Be Shown Monday 9,,,

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Quote: : » In the beginning of the gen, sony talks trash about it. now since got some success on xbox, yea lets take it to Sony: Our users don't want to pay for that crap, it's not even close to worth the $ FIFA players: EA wants more cash?

Cause if not my Internet isn't good enough to do steaming over the internet. Although PSNow worked ok surpisingly. But usually I have issues streaming game play over the internet. This app is for local area network only, from your PC to your router to your Xbox One console. If you are referring to Project XCloud, Microsoft's gaming live streaming project, trials will start later this year and allow streaming of games from MS to PC, consoles, android, smart phones, and other devices. With MS's Azure Network, quality live streaming of games worldwide assuming you have good internet coverage, shouldn't be a problem for them. Same with experienced cloud providers Amazon and Google. Sony doesn't have that advantage, so they would need to buy cloud coverage from other companies or invest a lot of money to build the infrastructure needed to provide that same kind of coverage.

Google Stadia puts Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC gaming on notice





Google CEO Sundar Pichai announces Stadia.


 James Martin/CNET


For years, we played video games in arcades. Then we huddled in front of specialized consoles hooked up to our living room televisions. The most dedicated of us built our own expensive PCs for the best experience.

Google is hoping to push another big change in gaming.

On Tuesday, Google announced Stadia, a service that lets you play games by way of a wide variety of devices and an internet connection, similar to how you watch shows and movies on Netflix.

 Google Stadia is a play-anywhere streaming game platform… 

1:56


The selling point for Stadia is convenience: You don’t need a chunky game console or expensive PC. Just a TV, set-top box, browser, phone or low-end PC that can surf the web using Google’s Chrome browser. You can use your own keyboard, mouse and a controller you have lying around, or you can use a specialized controller from Google that connects to its service over Wi-Fi.



Google’s promise for Stadia.


 James Martin/CNET


“Our ambition is far beyond a single game,” said Google’s Phil Harrison. Instead, the company sees the opportunity to give players “instant access” to a game by clicking a link. “The power of instant access is magical, and it’s already transformed the music and movie industries.”

The project will launch in the US, Canada, the UK and Europe in 2019. Google didn’t say how much games will cost to play, though it plans to say more in the summer.

Google sees gaming as a new way to seep into your life — as if email, search, YouTube and its Android software aren’t enough — through the promise of massive convenience. Who needs to spend hundreds of dollars on Microsoft’s Xbox One, Sony’s PlayStation 4, Nintendo’s Switch or a PC when you can just play a game over the internet on a scrawny laptop?

Though Google isn’t the first company to offer game streaming, its entry into the space could make waves within the video game world. Google has lots of money, and it’s made its name by offering reliable services like Gmail, Google Maps and Google Photos for free or on the cheap.

With Google’s streaming service you’ll no longer have to go to a retailer like Amazon, Best Buy or GameStop to get the latest title. Nor will you have to potentially wait hours to download it from online stores like Valve’s Steam. Instead, Google says, all you’ll need is a fast internet connection and a controller, and you’re set.

“Google has a lot going for it,” wrote IHS analyst Piers Harding-Rolls. He noted that between all of Google’s various services, it has a strong brand with consumers. The question, he said, is whether that can translate to the game world.

“Cloud is the new platform dynamic for the games sector and will be where the future competitive landscape resides,” he added. Google just needs to offer the right games to make it work.

A decade coming

I played my first streamed game about a decade ago, through a service run by a now-defunct startup called OnLive. Back then, the company offered to sell me access to hit games like the sci-fi shooting title Borderlands, playable through a PC, Mac or a little set-top box and a controller.

Just like with Netflix, all I had to do was log in, choose what I wanted to play and start. Sometimes the visuals would garble, just like they did back then with movie streaming too. But it worked. It felt like the future.

I’ve been waiting for that future ever since.

OnLive shut down in 2015, but other contenders have popped up. Sony launched its PlayStation Now streaming game service in 2014, as a complement to its popular PlayStation 4 game console. Microsoft and Electronic Arts, meanwhile, have said they’re developing competing services as well, though they haven’t offered firm launch dates. Even Comcast, the TV and internet provider, has dabbled in game streaming, most recently considering a purchase of the Korean game company Nexon, rumors say. 

All these companies are betting that the streaming approach will eventually upend the way we play video games, much in the same way Netflix did our movie watching a decade ago. The question is when.

“What’s good is, in this industry you can play on mobile or PC, and now it’s starting to be the same game,” said Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, who’s been working with Google for six years on streaming game technology. “It’s one more possibility to experience the worlds we create, and it gives opportunities to creators to take full advantage of mobile.”

A new promise

Google pitched its service as a way to bring together different people in the game industry, including players, streamers and coders. 

The company said it’s developed ways for people to start playing a game after clicking a link in YouTube, for example. The ease of sharing and starting a game with just a link could change the way we think of playing, Google’s Harrison said in an interview.

“We just gave the development community a vision of the future of what it means when your data center is a platform, and you are no longer bound by the device you’re playing, and that you are now screen agnostic,” Harrison said. “That’s really exciting.”

Google has also partnered with game developers like Epic Games and Unity. As a result, Google’s high-performance servers will stream games at up to 4K ultrahigh-definition video at 60 frames per second, meaning animations should move smoothly. 

Already, Google said, Stadia is able to deliver games with more performance than Microsoft’s Xbox One X and Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro combined. And Google said it eventually expects to double that performance as game developers create even more complex games.

Google won’t rely just on other game makers though. The company said it’ll follow Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo in building its own specialized games for its service, through a studio called Stadia Games and Entertainment.

“We are on the brink of a huge revolution in gaming,” said Jade Raymond, head of Google’s game making group and an industry veteran.

For its part, Microsoft said in a statement that it’s “a great time to be a gamer,” and noted that it’s devoted to offering choice as well through its upcoming Project xCloud service. Sony and Nintendo didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In the meantime, Google said it plans to closely knit its game service with YouTube, offering new ways for people to compete and play with one another. That’s particularly exciting to Matthew Patrick, a popular YouTube gaming personality known as MatPat.

“It unites technology and entertainment in ways we’ve never seen before,” he said.

GPU-based cryptocurrency miners have taken a beating throughout this bear market — just ask NVIDIA. However, users with spare GPUs may soon be able to put their ineffective mining hardware to another profitable use: renting rendering power to those looking to experience quality PC gaming on an underpowered computer. 

As reported by TechCrunch, Vectordash is looking to allow people with underpowered rigs not meant for gaming — such as Apple computers — to experience quality PC gaming with the help of individuals willing to rent their spare power for cloud rendering. This means that, in theory, even those with a Macbook Air could game at 4K resolution and 60 frames-per-second, given their internet bandwidth is capable of handling that amount of data.

If this sounds too good to be true, it’s not. Cloud rendering itself is nothing particularly new, so this idea is far from half-baked. Sony launched a cloud rendering service in PlayStation Now years ago — though it never really took off. Nevertheless, the company proved that cloud rendering is a viable option for gaming going forward.

Vectordash’s service will apparently run users $28 per month for cloud rendering capabilities. On the other side of the deal, GPU renters stand to make about $0.60 per day — which isn’t life-changing money for anyone who has the dough to throw at high-powered GPUs. However, the ability to put less-than-profitable meant-for-mining GPUs to work for another reason may help those who have been beaten down by both a bear market and dramatically more powerful ASIC mining rigs.



The key for Vectordash, of course, is offering payments for renters that are competitively priced with cryptocurrency mining returns — which shouldn’t be too difficult, given that GPU mining returns are currently negligible.

What do you think about Vectordash and cloud rendering PC games? Do you have GPUs you bought for cryptocurrency mining that you no longer use? Let us know in the comments below!

183574196487,3/19/2019,http://master-roger-wei.tumblr.com/post/183574196487,"Google has officially announced a major new effort in the video game world — and it might just change the future of the roughly $135 billion industry.

Speaking at the annual Games Development Conference (GDC) in San Francisco on Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pinchai unveiled Stadia, a long-rumored cloud-based games streaming service. Unlike with a traditional video game console or computer, which processes a game locally as it’s being played, Stadia games are processed in the cloud, with the action beamed instantaneously to players over the Internet. Google promises a lag-free experience, as long as you have a fast enough Internet connection.


“We are starting our next big challenge: building a game platform for everyone,” Pinchai said. “I think we can change the game by bringing together the power and creativity of the entire community, people who love to play games, people who love to watch games, and people who love to build games.”

Launching sometime later this year, Stadia gamers play on devices they already own, with controllers they already own (though Google also announced its own Stadia controller). “There is no box,” Google Vice President Phil Harrison, a former Sony and Microsoft executive, said. “The data center is your platform.”

Google and partners made it clear that, with Stadia, Google is doing more than simply testing the deep waters of the video game industry. Rather, Stadia is a full-bore effort to fully compete in the industry in four big ways. With Stadia, Google is openly competing as a platform against the industry’s largest players: Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Thanks to close integration with Google’s YouTube, Stadia will also compete against massive streaming services like Twitch. It will go up against enormous games distribution juggernauts like Steam and the upstart Epic Games Store. Finally, the announcement of a new first party game studio potentially puts them in competition with other large publishers like EA and Activision Blizzard. And even if it fails, Stadia will most likely change the video game industry forever.

Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and now Google

Stadia’s biggest impact will depend on how the largest console makers — Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo — will react to Stadia’s presence. The streaming service comes at a pivotal time in gaming. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are thought to be in their waning months as rumors and confirmations have swirled for the past year about the consoles’ official successors.

One facet that Google harped on over and over again for Stadia was its flexibility as a platform. It promised that it could grow with the changing times. When Google initiated Project Stream, which offered a limited number of players access to Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey through its Chrome browser on the day of the game’s launch, it said that it streamed the game at a resolution of up to 1080p and up to 60 frames per second. During Tuesday’s presentation, Google Vice President Majd Bakar said that Stadia, at launch, will support up to a 4K resolution, eventually with capabilities to output up to 8K and 120 frames a second.

Google said the disconnected nature of Stadia allows it to upgrade over time at the server level, rather than users needing to upgrade their own box. “We have built our platform to scale up with the infrastructure,” Bakar said.

Additionally, since the games will live on Google infrastructure, rather than individual home consoles, Harrison said that there wouldn’t be a need for downloads, updates or patches with the games on Stadia. “We wanted to reduce the friction between getting excited about a game and playing a game,” he said. “With Stadia, this waiting game will be a thing of the past.”

Sony’s CEO Kenichiro Yoshida and Xbox boss Phil Spencer have said that both companies are working on hardware for the future, which many believe will be released next year. The possible features of both boxes remain largely unknown, but if they lack the possibility of experiences like Stadia, Google may have already leapfrogged the competition before the next console generation cycle even begins. (Of course, it remains unclear how many top-tier games will be available on Stadia, and gamers tend to go where the good games are.)

Sony and Microsoft each have released platforms that directly stream games to consumers from their respective consoles — Sony rolled out PlayStation Now in 2014 and Microsoft announced Project xCloud last October. It’s clear both companies have long seen the writing on the wall of the future of consoles, but it’s unclear how far out they have built an infrastructure that could support a console-less future. Google’s existing data infrastructure and expertise could give the company a big advantage here.

“If you think about it, there are a lot of barriers for users to play high-end games,” Pinchai said. “Beautiful graphics really need high-end consoles or PCs. And games don’t have instant access.”

Targeting Twitch

Also in Google’s crosshairs: streaming services like Twitch. Google and partners showed off extensive integration between Stadia and YouTube. In one example, a viewer could be watching a stream of a multiplayer game, and join a live queue to play in the very same game as the streamer. 

The Stadia controller, which pairs with whatever device is streaming Stadia over Wi-Fi, also is tied in directly into YouTube, featuring a dedicated button that sends whatever you’re playing to your YouTube profile. 

Today’s presenters mentioned those who “love to watch games” as often as those who loved to play. It’s clear that Google has an eye out for the massive streaming market that has exploded in recent years.

Storming Steam’s Castle

The words “Stadia store” were only mentioned once by Harrison, without further elaboration, but it hinted that there would soon be a completely separate place from the traditional game marketplaces where players could buy their games.

Although Stadia games seem to be completely separate from the usual understanding of “PC games,” the fact that they will be playable on desktops and laptops appears likely to make this mysterious Stadia store a competitor to Steam.

Over the past several years, Steam has become a juggernaut for PC gamers and where the majority of games are purchased. That monopolistic hold over the medium was shaken late last year when Fortnite developer Epic Games announced the Epic Games Store, putting the most popular game in the world on it.

Stadia’s entry promises to turn the once-monolithic PC games market even more on its head. Google’s hefty presence has the possibility of upending how players think about PC games and where they are acquired.

Google the Games Developer

Finally, Tuesday’s announcement puts Google in competition with other game development and publishing studios. Harrison unveiled Stadia Games and Entertainment, describing it as “Google’s own first-party studio.”

Though the details were light, besides announcing its new head Jade Raymond, multiple game concepts designed in-house were shown. 

It seemed as though the studio would vie for partnerships with other development studios, but create plenty of its own games as well. That could turn Google into an AAA games studio in competition with the likes of Activision and EA. 

Win or lose, change is coming

Google’s presentation left an enormous number of questions unanswered, many of which Harrison promised to address this summer. Among the unknowns: Stadia will clearly require users to have speedy Internet connections, but access to high-speed broadband is unequal across the U.S. Google hasn’t announced a price for the service, either. And other companies (though none with the clout of Google) have tried and largely failed to offer a similar service.

Then there’s the matter of which games Stadia will offer. It’s a new platform, and developers haven’t had much time to create games for it yet. Id’s Doom Eternal and publisher/developer Ubisoft were mentioned during Google’s event, but gaming services can live or die on their launch titles. Still, Google’s decision to announce Stadia at the Game Developers Conference — to an audience largely made up of industry insiders and developers — was no doubt a strategic move to build excitement among the very people who will build the games that could potentially lift the platform to success. 

“Today, our industry captivates over 2 billion players from all around the world,” Harrison said. “At the center of that community, its beating heart, are the game developers. The people in this room who create the most incredible game experiences that delight players with engrossing stories, characters and worlds through a dazzling display of technology, artistry and magic.”

Even if Google’s Stadia isn’t an immediate hit, it could change gaming forever. By promising a game-streaming future, free from download times and the need for lots of local processing power, Google has set the bar even higher for what future gamers will expect. The promise of “instant access” is a hope for many gamers, and it’s exactly what Google says is coming. The largest players in the game industry were surely watching today. If they weren’t already hard at work on the diversity, flexibility and performance that Google has promised, they certainly are now.",,master-roger-wei,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"New story in Technology from Time: Stadia, Google’s Big Push Into Video Games, Could Change Everything About How We Play",Post,,

I recently just found this website, and I have to say, it is amazing. I have been playing the PlayStation ever since I was 4 when I got a PS2, and have been a hardcore gamer ever since. One thing I really love about PlayStation now is earning trophies. Earning trophies make me feel really awesome about myself and I get respect from people both in real life and on the Internet when I tell of my accomplishments. This website's leaderboards is a great way to also compare myself against players like me everywhere, and I also love how cheaters are easily removed. However, there is a problem. Years ago, on Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, I unfortunately ran into a hacker. I was in a random lobby on the TranZit zombies map trying to find people to complete the Tower of Babble trophy, which required you to complete the easter egg/quest for the map. While my friend and I were in the cornfield trying to do the steps, we started having random trophies appear on our screen, which we figured were just a few glitches because I recognized them as campaign trophies. I soon realized what was happening the second I earned a trophy for the zombies map Mob of the Dead, which was a DLC map that I did not own at that time. By the time I realized what was happening, the damage was already done to me and my friend. Even after the game ended, we were still being awarded trophies for absolutely no reason. It did stop eventually, and when it did it left me a few trophies to earn in the campaign that I could still earn legitimately. Black Ops 2 is my rarest platinum, but because I know I unintentionally was hacked into making the platinum easier I did not include it in my trophy cabinet. I am an honest person when it comes to things like this and I would like to know how I can not be flagged as illegitimate because of events I had no control of. Is there any way that I can talk to the owner of the site or someone who helps out with maintaining the cheating system? I'm worried someone will see the dates for the hacked trophies and make the assumption that I am a cheater, which is not the case. I appreciate everyone that reads this long post and gives me helpful advice or even helps me solve the problem that I am currently facing. ====================::==================== And you getting a flag for BO2 doesn't matter one bit as long as it doesn't happen again in WaW and some third game I don't even know about yet. If it happens in WaW, just hide it before it's flagged. Same goes for any other game.",,MMDE,United States of America,,,Positive,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,I need help staying legitimate on the leaderboards!,,,

Microsoft has its xCloud stuff, already a presence in gaming compared to Google and an Internet infrastructure even better than Google (because of Azure their business oriented cloud). They will probably be the more serious competitor (and IMO the leader). They just lack the YouTube integration (which is a big thing for Stadia for sure) Sony has Playstation Now, an even more powerful brand in the gaming world (and respected first party studios). They can be a serious competitor. But can they follow on the technical side as well as Google and MS ? Amazon is the wild card, they have Twitch which for gaming is similar to YouTube, they are interested in gaming (Twitch but also its launcher, their first party studio and they sell physical games so if the industry switch to streaming they better be there for it). They also have AWS so technically, they have already the infrastructure for it. Then, you have the third party publishers, they'll probably team up with the big players as I don't know if they have the technical side to assure a correct competing service. Ubisoft and EA have expressed their belief that streaming is the future. I think Ubisoft may just play with everyone (like they do with Uplay or with the Project Stream demo) and EA might try to do their own service (or rely on MS since they have a better relation with them via EA Access since years).

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,uppityamy,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

I've been pc/nintendo for a while now. Unfortunately you just can't get nintendo games on the pc. Well you can't get Sony games on PC either, its seems the only console manufacturer that actually puts out most of their games on PC is Microsoft. That is not true. Except for the latest games, many of Sony's older exclusives(including some from this gen) are available on PSNow which you can access on PC or via emulators. The Quantic games exclusives including Detroit Become Human are also about to be offered on the Epic website on PC. Eventually all the newer exclusives will also be made available on PSNow on PC. MS also owns the Windows OS platform on PC so basically they are offering their games on their own platform on PC and not just on Xbox One. They have been publishing PC games(MS Flight Simulator) long before even the Windows OS existed. Yeah Sony will offer their games on PC after they feel those specific games are no longer driving console sales which is pretty smart. I’m sure by the time PS5 comes out and they no longer care about selling PS4s they will put all the PS4 exclusives on PSNow.

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade."" Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft's xCloud, Apple's service is not cloud-based. The company also unveiled its new Apple TV+ service and a variety of exclusive original shows. https://archive.fo/7ANhX Looks like it's mostly indieshit with expected SJW bullshit or basically just a glorified app store+ but at least it's not streaming only yet . ====================::==================== Klei Entertainment >Don’t.

A game streaming service isn't aimed at the core gaming community, it's aimed at people who: haven't had a console in years, or have never had one but would be willing to play games if they didn't have have to buy one. people who only buy 1 or 2 games a year, usually the big multiplayer shooter titles and/or sports games. Kids who's parents won't buy them a new console yet cause they already have a system. Are you sure? I mean that like saying no one is who goes to the cinemas regularly will care about Netflix, small screen, you have to wait for the mail to arrive etc. And look st it now, biggest entertainment company in the world. Not the same thing, tv/movies is a passive experience, games are an interactive one, the lag, even if it's only slight lag because of the number of data centers is going to be unacceptable to most gamers, look at how hard of a time psnow has had catching on. I'm not saying it doesn't have a chance of catching on, this could easily blow up like Netflix did, but if it does it's mostly going to be driven by more casual gamers, most core gamers are always going to prefer having the game coming from the console/PC under there tv rather than somewhere miles away.",,arstos,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

However I don’t think the Google Stadia will be around long for a few reasons. Every gamer I’ve talked to about it is saying they’ll be sticking to physical copies of games, I’ve also seen tons of tech channels and big gamers already saying the same thing. Personally I like my physical copies of games, it just feels right. If you look back, PlayStation tried this same idea and it flopped. PlayStation Now wasn’t it called? I’m not saying Google couldn’t get lucky, but the top dogs in the Industry haven’t even figured out how to perfect this yet, so Google coming into something they normally don’t do being the underdog making all these claims has me questioning a bit, as I’m sure a lot of others are as well. Google is used to being the people who show gaming (YouTube) but creating and managing a console is obviously way different. Most people simply don’t have the WiFi to stream 4K games either.

183740581479,3/27/2019,http://aaronaknightca.tumblr.com/post/183740581479,"Google


Yesterday Google announced its long-anticipated streaming game platform, Stadia. In the news post we called it an “invasion” of gaming: this combination platform and delivery service has the potential to compete with consoles, PCs, and mobile games, all at once.

Google’s ambition is huge, but it’s appropriate to the task. The game industry as we know it is stagnating in terms of innovation, but its biggest corporate players are well-entrenched and experienced. If Stadia is to compete with the likes of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, it needs to nail three crucial elements when it launches later in 2019.

Get the Games

The most important piece in the gaming platform puzzle is, naturally, the games. Consoles live and die on their game selection, and securing exclusive and desirable titles (either from third-party publishers or developers owned by the console manufacturer) is the best way to make sure you’re going to succeed.

With Stadia, Google is already on the right track. Its best move is undoubtedly becoming a publisher itself. Google hired Jade Raymond, formerly a game producer and studio head at mega-publishers EA and Ubisoft, to lead its own game studio. Stadia Games and Entertainment, a separate but linked company under Alphabet’s ever-widening umbrella, will be developing its own games for the Stadia platform as well as wooing independent developers to bring their games onboard.
Google’s Stadia studio, under Ubisoft and EA veteran Raymond, will woo developers. Google
Another good move: announcing Stadia at the yearly Game Developer Conference, instead of at the upcoming Google I/O show or E3. By introducing Stadia specifically to game developers and publishers, including quite a lot of time showing off the unique design flexibility  of its remote Linux- and Vulkan-powered hardware, surely ignited the imagination of a lot of game makers. Today, the day after the announcement, you can bet there are game directors and developers scrambling to meet with Google’s Stadia team at GDC, desperate to check out the platform and get games on at launch.

Stadia isn’t the first gaming platform to use a 100% remote streaming setup: the ill-fated OnLive eventually became Sony’s PlayStation Now, NVIDIA’s GeForce Now is currently in beta, and Shadow allows for a more techy, individualistic approach. Microsoft is almost certainly going to go into streaming in a big way with the next Xbox, and rumors suggest that Verizon and Amazon are looking into it as well.
Stadia already works with the industry’s most popular software tools. Google
But Stadia is the first streaming system to be built with streaming in mind from the ground up and upon the massive power of Google’s data centers and money. Demonstrating deep hooks in Chrome and YouTube (to capture the Twitch audience), powerful new ways to play split-screen and asynchronous multiplayer, and baked-in support for massively popular developer tools like Unreal Engine, Unity, CryEngine, and Havok are all smart moves for a new platform.

It means that not only will developers be able to port their existing projects to Stadia’s hardware easily, but they’ll also be able to create entirely new types of games that are only possible with access to Stadia’s web, streaming, and scalability functions.
DOOM Eternal is the only upcoming game confirmed to already be running on Stadia. Google
During the GDC presentation, Google demonstrated partner projects with Ubisoft, Bethesda, 2K, Square-Enix, Tangent Games, Tequila Works, and Q-Games, but at the time of writing only Id Software’s DOOM Eternal has been confirmed for release on Stadia. Of course, Google can still mess up its initial relationship by limiting developers with restrictive platform rules, or by simply asking them for too much of a cut of their profits. Which is a nice segue into…

The Price is Right

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,kitsune-tarix,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

Any serious speedrunner plays games designed for a CRT on a CRT, there is no substitute for them. For the average player, it doesn't make games unplayable by any stretch. But older games, especially really trying 3rd/4th gen games, are made harder with that little bit of input lag. IIRC most LCD screens have about 4 frames of input lag compared to a CRT. Doesn't sound like a lot, but it makes it tough to hit those pixel perfect jumps sometimes. If you have a 3DS you can see the difference big time as the 3DS has little to no input lag - playing an old NES game on a console vs. 3DS, I think even a lower skilled player can notice a small difference. But that's 3-4 frames of input lag. With PSNow you can MUCH higher input lag - some people have it as bad as 1-2 seconds which is unplayable IMO for anything beside turn based games.",,caninehere,United States of America,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Reddit,,,,,,,,

If it works as advertised—a big “if”—it could end the gaming hardware market as we know it. With Stadia, which is slated to launch later this year, Google is aiming for nothing less than entirely detaching video games from the hardware you own. Instead of downloading a game to your computer or putting a disc in your console, the game would be installed on a remote server that Google owns and operates. You won’t have to buy a new console or build a new PC to run the latest generation of games. Instead, Google can upgrade Stadia servers entirely behind the scenes. You’ll just wake up one day and find that you can play games with better graphics. This presumably means high-end gaming is about to get a lot cheaper—a top-of-the-line PlayStation 4 Pro costs about $400—though Google declined to share pricing details with OneZero . We don’t tend to think about it too much, but video games have an unusually intimate connection with the hardware they run on. Every few years, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and PC hardware manufacturers release new devices that add more power and features to the games you play. Microsoft made 4K gaming possible with the Xbox One X , NVIDIA launched graphics cards capable of ray tracing , and Nintendo had that weird expansion pack that made Donkey Kong 64 not crash. For as long as they’ve existed, video games and their hardware have been intrinsically linked. Think The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time , for instance, and you’ll picture the Nintendo 64 it ran on. But while this relationship is widely accepted in gaming, the same isn’t true for most other kinds of software. A professional video editor might need a better machine to squeeze more out of Adobe Premiere, but no one has to upgrade their phone every couple years to use Gmail or buy a new laptop to run the latest version of Microsoft Word. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty This kind of cloud gaming service has been tried many times before, from the failed OnLive to PlayStation Now and to the still-in-beta NVIDIA GeForce Now . But two key factors set Google’s attempt apart. First, you may already own a device capable of running Stadia. GeForce Now is the closest to this platform-agnostic dream, with support for both Mac and Windows computers, but Stadia goes a step further by including Chromebooks, phones, and even the modest Chromecast streaming device. If you have a gadget capable of running YouTube, Google says you can play the newest high-end games using Stadia. Second, the servers these games will run on are owned by Google. And Google is very good at building servers . Video games, especially the visually rich AAA games that most modern consoles can play, are among the most resource-hungry applications any computer can run . For an individual player, keeping up with the pace of hardware innovation can be a Sisyphean task—and an obscenely expensive one at that. For Google, upgrading massive systems with the latest hardware is done routinely. Consider the current gold standard of gaming: 4K resolution, running at 60 frames per second. If you have a 4K TV today, you have a few options available to play games that can get the most out of it. You can buy an Xbox One X or a PlayStation 4 Pro , or you could build a PC capable of playing 4K games. According to Google, Stadia will launch with support for playing games at 4K HDR at 60 fps right off the bat. For a new service launching in 2019, perhaps that’s to be expected. However, the company went a step further, announcing that it would scale up to 8K and 120 fps in the future. The company didn’t give a timeline for when this would happen, but since the first consumer-level 8K TVs were only just announced this year, few consumers are likely to be in any rush. This approach also removes the roadblock for more subtle innovations. For example, NVIDIA’s new ray-tracing graphics cards simulate the way light works in the real world, creating instant shadows and realistic reflections and simplifying a lot of the work game developers have to do to make a game look good. The benefit is so immediately obvious that it spawned its own meme . But ray tracing presents a problem for game developers: It only works on NVIDIA graphics cards that support the feature. The company is expanding the list of supported cards , but that still leaves a potential audience that’s limited to a subset of PC gamers who have a small selection of relatively high-end graphics cards. With such a minuscule audience, few outside of the biggest studios will invest resources into developing games for it. It’s just not worth it yet. Were that technology to be incorporated into Stadia servers, however, the potential audience would be massive. Instead of waiting for consumers to slowly migrate to new hardware, bigger and better games can be shipped as soon as Google’s data servers are upgraded. Companies like NVIDIA would also be more likely to sell their new high-end hardware directly to Google, rather than trying to incrementally sell $600-plus cards to average consumers. There are still a lot of potential stumbling blocks for Stadia. The biggest bottleneck is home internet speeds , which, in the United States, have not always had the bandwidth to support something as intense as 4K game streaming. There’s also the price: $20 a month for access to a library of games?—?as is the case for PlayStation Now ?—?might be reasonable, but if the company makes users pay separately for additional features like 4K streaming or ray tracing, it might end up a wash compared to just buying a console. What’s not in question is the earth-shattering effect Stadia will have on gaming hardware in the home if the service works as advertised. To use a soon-to-be-timely pop culture analogy, the industry has resembled the endlessly turning wheel of power in Westeros that Daenerys Targaryen describes in Games of Thrones : Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, NVIDIA, each taking their turn on top with successive and expensive upgrades. Consumers have accepted the need to buy new consoles or graphics cards every few years, because there has been no other way to play the latest games. In a world where you can play the newest Tomb Raider in perfect 4K HDR on something as simple as a Chromecast, however, the endlessly turning wheel of hardware upgrades won’t just stop—it will break altogether. onezero.medium.com",,Glenn Petersen,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,32079905,,,

[This](https://i.imgur.com/e3pJmhc.jpg) is the current availability of FIOS and fiber in general is just as uncommon across the US. If you think your experience is normal then you are wrong. I’ve tried direct and indirect connections even at home with different routers to no avail. Even wired on my PC I’d get hiccups with my PS4 Pro. And I’ve NEVER had a lagfree experience. Sometimes I’ve had it be bearable enough to play anything but twitch sensitive games. Games like FPS, frame accurate fighting games (Mortal Kombat, SF4, etc), anything requiring quick movements have been ranging from okay to downright horrible. The routers I’ve used were a Netgear Nighthawk, Apple AirPort Extreme, Arris Modem/Router TG862. I’ve tried several over WiFi and several over Ethernet. The best connection I’ve had with the least issues was GeForce Live via Ethernet on my PC. I’ve never had much luck with PlayStation Remote Play sadly. And PlayStation Now just never worked well for me at all. But all of this means nothing because I know what the hell Im doing, what makes game consoles profitable are the fact that you just plug them in and play. If you have to setup a world of crap to get it working so it mimics the game console controls it’s going to fall on deaf ears of the average consumer. Those people are going to have shitty wireless router/modem combos and as soon as they play their first game on their budget cell phone via WiFi they will complain they can’t shoot anyone on Call of Duty or tackle anyone in Madden and just give up.",,Heratiki,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Here’s what to expect [br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095344.png""][br][br][br][br]Google is making a big play in gaming next week, but we’re still unsure exactly what that entails. For years, the company has toyed with the idea of getting involved in what is now the biggest sector of the entertainment industry, worth an [a href=""https://lpesports.com/e-sports-news/the-video-games-industry-is-bigger-than-hollywood""]estimated $138 billion dollars as of last fall[/a]. And it would make competitive sense: Amazon owns Twitch, Facebook acquired Oculus, and Microsoft has Xbox. The only other major tech company without a serious gaming platform or investment of its own, not counting mobile app stores, is Apple, although even the iPhone maker is now [a href=""https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/apple-reportedly-plans-netflix-for-games-subscription-service/""]rumored to be working on a game subscription service of its own[/a].[br][br]Google has always had many of the pieces required to challenge the likes of Sony and Nintendo. The Android operating system is the most-used mobile software on smartphones around the world, while the Chrome browser and Chromecast streaming platform have given the company an easy way to run applications in real time and access television sets. It’s not hard to imagine an Android or browser-based gaming service that can let you play advanced software on a living room TV.[br][br]But, until now, all we’ve seen are a few strong hints to what Google might be building. That changes on Tuesday of next week, when Google plans to hold its [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262215/google-gdc-19-keynote-event-teaser-video-project-stream""]first-ever keynote at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco[/a]. There’s been a lot of news over the past few months that gives us a good idea at what’s to come, but whatever Google does announce, it could have a big impact on an industry that is transforming how it builds, distributes, and sells games. Here’s a rundown what we know so far and what we think might be coming next week.[br][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095355.png""][br][br][br]Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge[br] It’s highly likely it involves cloud gaming [br][br]In teasing its GDC keynote, Google said it would unveil its “vision for the future of gaming.” And, going off numerous previous reports and public showings from the company itself, it’s highly likely the announcement involves a full-fledged cloud gaming service. [a href=""https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-may-step-into-gaming-with-yeti-streaming-service""]More than a year ago[/a], The Information first reported about Google’s Project Yeti, the codename for an internal division responsible for building a next-generation streaming service similar to existing but limited options like Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now.[br][br]Even before Sony and Nvidia’s services existed, cloud gaming had been a bit like the industry’s holy grail: a just-out-of-reach ideal that has preoccupied a number of startups like OnLive, Gaikai, and others, but that’s never been cracked because the infrastructure and economics haven’t been properly worked out.[br][br]CLOUD GAMING HAS BEEN THE INDUSTRY’S HOLY GRAIL FOR YEARS[br][br]The concept is relatively simple. What if, like Netflix and Spotify, you could not only digitally distribute games, but also stream them over the internet, so players wouldn’t need expensive hardware to play graphically-intensive titles? It’s difficult because games, unlike other forms of media, are both incredibly large in size and require real-time input from players. But it is doable, by wiring up the necessary hardware in a data center, running the game on a remote machine, and sending the video and receiving player commands over the internet.[br][br]Regardless, it’s been impressive how many additional companies have revealed cloud gaming services in the past few years, turning what was once a niche experimental effort in an industry-wide race to figure out the future. Microsoft has [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263405/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-demo-video""]gone public with its own game streaming platform[/a], xCloud, that it plans to start testing later this year. EA, after acquiring the rental and cloud gaming service GameFly, is [a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/eas-project-atlas-wants-your-gaming-to-run-on-cloud-computing-and-ai/""]now working on a product of its own called Project Atlas[/a]. Even Verizon is getting into the game, with a [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179048/verizon-gaming-video-game-streaming-service-vzg-nvidia-shield-android""]test service up and running on Nvidia Shield set-top boxes[/a]. Earlier this week, [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265818/valve-steam-link-anywhere-personal-cloud-service-gaming-pc-gdc-2019""]Valve expanded its Steam Link service[/a] to turn it into a personal cloud gaming app. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177253/amazon-cloud-gaming-service-rumor-job-posting""]Both Amazon and Nintendo[/a]are looking into the technology, too.[br][br]There’s been a number of obvious signs that Google is indeed working on cloud gaming. Most prominently, Google [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17924492/google-project-stream-game-assassins-creed-odyssey-free-testing""]launched its public test of Project Stream[/a], an experimental game streaming technology that worked directly in its Chrome browser. Through a partnership with Ubisoft, Google let you play the brand-new Assassin’s Creed Odyssey — without needing to purchase the game — on pretty much any machine, given you had a strong enough internet connection.[br][br]GOOGLE’S PROJECT STREAM TEST IS AN OBVIOUS SIGN OF WHAT’S TO COME[br][br]It was a remarkable experiment, not [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950998/google-project-stream-gaming-assasins-creed-odyssey-first-impression""]just because it actually worked quite well[/a], but also because a game studio as large as Ubisoft agreed to let one of its biggest launches of the year be a test subject. The test is now over, but Google [a href=""https://blog.google/technology/developers/pushing-limits-streaming-technology/""]set out to gather data[/a] from what it considered a “technical test to solve some of the biggest challenges of streaming,” data that could help inform whatever product it announces next week.[br][br]There’s also been a lot of strategic hires in the past 18 months or so that hint toward a large, legitimate push into the gaming sector. Phil Harrison, a long-time executive of both Sony and Microsoft’s Xbox team, [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/22/16921214/phil-harrison-google-games""]joined Google last year[/a] as a general manager and vice president, but working in an disclosed capacity. At the time, it was believed Harrison was going to help Google build out its virtual and augmented reality platforms as viable gaming businesses. But Harrison was also on the board of game streaming company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/16/4442372/inside-gaikai-how-to-make-cloud-gaming-as-easy-as-watching-youtube""]Gaikai[/a], a company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4010420/sonys-playstation-4-will-use-gaikai-game-streaming-technology""]acquired by Sony in 2012[/a] and instrumental to the launch of its PlayStation Now service. So it’s likely Harrison is helping Google in its similar efforts.[br][br]Later in the year, [a href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1564647&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjackbuser%2F""]Google hired Jack Buser[/a], who was a senior director at Sony’s game streaming unit and led the PlayStation platform’s social efforts before that. Shortly after, Google [a href=""https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/30/google-hires-sonys-playstation-vr-guru-and-magic-lab-head-richard-marks/""]also hired Sony senior research engineer Richard Marks[/a], who helped build the PlayStation VR headset and Move controller.[br][br]And just last week, gaming industry veteran Jade Raymond [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/13/18263911/jade-raymond-google-vp""]also joined Google as a vice president[/a], though we don’t what team or division she’ll be leading. The timing may not be coincidental. Raymond, who was executive producer and co-creator of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed and later joined Electronic Arts, could be heading up some type of creative division at Google, or one responsible for developer outreach given her connections at big studios and publishers.[br][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][br][br]Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge[br][br] There’s a hardware component, and it may involve Chromecast [br][br]We don’t have too much to go on regarding what this service might look like, but we do know that there’s a strong likelihood there is custom Google hardware involved. Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware and its senior vice president of devices, tweeted out a link to the GDC keynote earlier this week:[br][br]Osterloh oversees Pixel phones, Google Home devices, and the myriad other hardware products the search giant now produces in-house. Whether that means we’re getting a Pixel-branded cloud gaming console or something else entirely is unclear. But it’s interesting nonetheless to see Osterloh involved in some way. [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]Kotaku[/a] [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]’s Jason Schreier[/a], who corroborated many of the initial details about Google’s upcoming service last summer, also reported that hardware will be one of three big components to the service, the other two being streaming and a massive in-house developer division that sounds very much like what Raymond could be involved in.[br][br]If we had to speculate on what exactly a Google game-streaming platform look like, we don’t have to look too hard. That’s because it could very well already exist, at least in part, as Chromecast. Google’s streaming dongle is already capable of letting you play Android games on your TV using screen mirroring from a compatible smartphone.[br][br]Now, that’s not to say that this new game streaming platform will just piggyback off Chromecast. But Chromecast does provide a model for how Google might go about delivering gaming experiences to a TV. For one, it’s a no-frills package that plugs in through one port and stays out of the way. And because cloud gaming, like media streaming, doesn’t require a ton of local processing power, the hardware can be lightweight and cheap. Given the amount of buzz Google is creating here though, it seems more likely it’ll drop all-new hardware specifically for gaming.[br][br] There could be a game controller to go with it [br][br]You can’t have console-quality gaming (if that is indeed what Google is going for) without some type of peripheral. For Google, that means building your own controller. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257911/google-patent-game-controller-project-stream-streaming-service-render""]According to a patent revealed late last week[/a], that might be exactly what the company has done, with images showing off a Google-branded gamepad that like a cross between a PlayStation controller and the [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]ill-fated[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] [/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]Ouya’s[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] gamepad[/a] from a half-decade ago.[br][br][br][br][br][br][br]Image: Google[br][br]This, even if Google doesn’t produce an actual console, might be why Osterloh’s hardware division is involved. For one, if Microsoft and Sony are building competing services, Google might not want its customers using other companies’ controllers.[br][br]And it’s a no-brainer that a service of this type would need to be first-and-foremost a controller-centric experience. As it stands right now, any kind of cloud gaming service is probably going to have at least some issues with connectivity. The bar for console game performance is much lower than on PC, where competitive games require the best connections possible and even milliseconds of latency matter to hardcore players.[br][br]In other words, this probably isn’t going to launch as a mouse-and-keyboard experience, at least not at first. So while we might not get Fortnite , Apex Legends , or Dota 2 on Google’s platform, there’s a good chance this service could very well be a place to play big-budget, single-player games like Assassin’s Creed .[br][br] ====================::==================== thanks",,edwardsm,France,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Everything we think we know about Google’s mystery gaming announcement,,,

However I don’t think the Google Stadia will be around long for a few reasons. Every gamer I’ve talked to about it is saying they’ll be sticking to physical copies of games, I’ve also seen tons of tech channels and big gamers already saying the same thing. Personally I like my physical copies of games, it just feels right. If you look back, PlayStation tried this same idea and it flopped. PlayStation Now wasn’t it called? I’m not saying Google couldn’t get lucky, but the top dogs in the Industry haven’t even figured out how to perfect this yet, so Google coming into something they normally don’t do being the underdog making all these claims has me questioning a bit, as I’m sure a lot of others are as well. Google is used to being the people who show gaming (YouTube) but creating and managing a console is obviously way different. Most people simply don’t have the WiFi to stream 4K games either. If it does great for a few years and proves itself maybe I’ll give it a go, but I refuse to dump money into something that big that could potentially fail and leave me with absolutely nothing to show where said money went.",,AceFire_,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

But if you just want to buy the games at this point buying the games is cheaper and the PS3 streaming service doesn't work so great in my experience. > Subscribing for just a couple of games obviously isn't worth it, but that's not what the point of the service is. Honestly it works great for other services. But Game Pass is $10/month and EA Access/Origin Access is $5/mo and at that price point you EASILY get your money's worth... meanwhile PSNow is $20/mo. Games aren't like Netflix where you can burn through movies super easy, it takes time to play through stuff. Longer for some people than others. Personally I just don't think it is really worth the asking price but that is mostly because the asking price is so high (and for me my PS4 is not my primary way of playing games, i use it for exclusives only).",,caninehere,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Click to expand... you don't get it. i have phenomenal internet speeds. but unless the game's server is nearby, it doesn't matter. internet speed is almost moot at this point - a sustainable bandwidth is +/- more important for everyone with a decent (50+ Mbps) internet plan. and with 120 Mbps and very low latency on my end, i can play a game like path of exile from a ~50 mile away server (pretty close) with the client obviously on my machine... and get ~20-30 ms. which is great. but when there are lag spikes/latency issues, even 80ms is very noticeable. 100 gets bad. and this is with the game running on my machine, which minimizes some of the issues (input lag vs serverside). and it's just an arpg, which is less sensitive than most game types. most games, esp console games aren't this serious and generally don't make checks to maintain consistency between the client and the server (syncing). especially for single player. it would need to receive your inputs and send the response to visualize everything, effectively doubling the response time for many games (inputs on client side and displayed quickly, without having to send/receive confirmation from server with occasional syncs is a major QoL) google's service would have everything on the server's end. as good as one's internet is/can be, it won't really matter at all if the server isn't close enough/isn't stable enough. they'd need servers in basically every city - and even then, those not in cities would just be outright screwed. and playing multiplayer - ugh, how many servers are going to have to ping/coordinate it?

MMO doesn't mean much, anymore (term is now too generic and often misused) - but i bet most of them would have major issues with this. MMOs tend to be pretty serious about keeping data on their own servers' sides, which means on top of the latency one would have from their end to google, they're would likely be additional latency from google to the game's server. unless they'd want an additional fragment to their playerbase (ie: stadia players isolated to a stadia server and other stadia players - a different realm)",,rob mafia,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,Google Stadia | Page 3,,,

Gaming has only just tipped more towards buying digital game sales this generation let alone streaming games and I think you vastly overestimate how good streaming is going to get, also, these people who can't afford physical hardware will most likely not be able to afford a sub fee for this or even an ISP with a consistent internet connection to play. Streaming games is just the worst. On top of all of this. You don't even own anything. That's the worst part of all of this. You haven't owned most games for a very long time. You own an entitlement. Here's the thing... The internet infrastructure around the world is going to change significantly in the next few years. 5G is a significantly bigger upgrade than the 3g -> 4g upgrade.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,see-you-around-kid,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

The side of it being viable is that it's a working business strategy, but even as a business strategy it only works because statistically enough people will purchase for it to profit. Exclusives don't necessarily bring the best forms of entertainment, but in oligopolistic markets, exclusivity drives competitiveness, and as such creates a sort of artificial arms race to be the best, hence why it brings about the best in both companies. The problems arise though when exclusivity DOESN'T cause that kind of reaction. Steam isn't gonna actively try to get back those who sign an agreement to be on the Epic Games Store. It's not like a game like Bloodborne which was console exclusive to the PS4 and only recently became playable on PC thanks to Playstation Now, because that helped drive sales of the PS4, which forced Microsoft to pull out the stops on any exclusives it might have for the Xbox One. Competition in an oligopolistic market is something that benefits multiple companies and all the consumers who are customers of those companies, but only when both sides decide to join in, hence all of the great entertainment in the past decades. However, based on Steam's response to Epic, they don't even appear to be attempting to compete. In other words, this method of doing business only works when both sides are actively participating in it, because it drives the market and acts as a way of both sides profiting while also letting consumers reap the benefits. Since Steam, and thus Valve, are not reciprocating, Epic is taking part in a nonviable business strategy that will actually hurt them in the end. They're making big risks shelling out money for exclusives which may or may not pay off, which could really hurt them in the long run.",,8bitmadness,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I do think this can and will be successful in winning over people who are mildly interested in gaming but don't care about it enough to invest hundreds into the latest console or PC gaming hardware. I'm not sure what makes people think this will suddenly kill game ownership or reduce all games to cheap subscriptions. Publishers aren't going to suddenly give up making $80 per game to offer them for next to nothing in a subscription service. I think Stadia for the most part will just be an easier way to access games that will still be in that $60-80 per title range. See this is where I have some serious doubt. It costs a lot of money to set up and run a cloud service like this, at least in my eyes I don't think google (or anyone else that comes along) is going to be content with letting users use their service for a one time fee. This is why I have so many questions on how they are going to sell this, you can practically rule out physical media as an option here and I also think most games will be layered under some sort of subscription. Be it a subscription to use the service + traditional point of sale purchases or tiers of subscriptions that cover different types of games or maybe a rental type service where you pay a fee to use the game for 1 month. Having said that the movie industry has mostly transitioned to services that allow for one time purchases giving you the option to streaming wherever and whenever after the initial point of sale so it's not like its going to be completely unprecedented either if they go that route. Having said that I honestly think if this takes off its going to usher in some major changes in the way we buy and consume videogames. If games all start to fall under a blanket subscription model and game ownership is taken away from us to allow for services like this I think that honestly truly suck and hopefully there is an option to have it both ways, on the flipside with re-sales all but eliminated and the standard 60$ AAA game tag eliminated maybe developers can go back to the days where they just crafted amazing 8-10 hour story games without all the excessive filler that most AAA games have nowadays to pad the game length to give the perception of value. I do think Google is going to have an incredible tough time to gain footing here, if Microsoft and Sony launch a comparable service that leverages your existing game library and subscription services I don't see any reason why anyone would jump over to Google. That's not even an ""if"" at this point as Microsoft is set to release Xcloud later this year and Sony already has PSNow they would just need to open it up and improve upon it.",,SpicYMchaggis,Canada,Alberta,Calgary,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade.""

Google Stadia instantly becomes a Netflix-like game streaming powerhouse





Google CEO Sundar Pichai announces Stadia.


 James Martin/CNET


For years, we played video games in arcades. Then we huddled in front of specialized consoles hooked up to our living room televisions. The most dedicated of us built our own expensive PCs for the best experience.

Google is hoping to push another big change in gaming.

On Tuesday, Google announced Stadia, a service that lets you play games by way of a wide variety of devices and an internet connection, similar to how you watch shows and movies on Netflix.

 Google rolls out Stadia gaming service and controller 

3:53


The selling point for Stadia is convenience: You don’t need a hunky game console or expensive PC. Just a TV, browser, phone or low-end PC that can surf the web using Google’s Chrome browser. And a specialized controller from Google that connects to its service over Wi-Fi.



Google’s promise for Stadia.


 James Martin/CNET


“Our ambition is far beyond a single game,” said Google’s Phil Harrison. Instead, the company sees the opportunity to give players “instant access” to a game by clicking a link. “The power of instant access is magical, and it’s already transformed the music and movie industries.”

The project will launch in the US, Canada, the UK and Europe in 2019. Google didn’t say how much games will cost to play, though the company said it plans to say more in the summer.

Google sees gaming as a new way to seep into your life — as if email, search, YouTube and its Android software aren’t enough — through the promise of massive convenience. Who needs to spend hundreds of dollars on Microsoft’s Xbox One, Sony’s PlayStation 4, Nintendo’s Switch or a PC when you can just play a game over the internet on a scrawny laptop?

Though Google isn’t the first company to offer game streaming, its entry into the space could make waves within the video game world. Google has lots of money, and it’s made its name by offering reliable services like Gmail, Google Maps and Google Photos for free or on the cheap.

With Google’s streaming service you’ll no longer have to go to a retailer like Amazon, Best Buy or GameStop to get the latest title. Nor will you have to potentially wait hours to download it from online stores like Valve’s Steam. Instead, Google says, all you’ll need is a fast internet connection and a controller, and you’re set.

“Google has a lot going for it,” wrote IHS analyst Piers Harding-Rolls. He noted that between all of Google’s various services, it has a strong brand with consumers. The question, he said, is whether that can translate to the game world.

“Cloud is the new platform dynamic for the games sector and will be where the future competitive landscape resides,” he added. Google just needs to offer the right games to make it work.

A decade coming

I played my first streamed game about a decade ago, through a service run by a now-defunct startup called OnLive. Back then, the company offered to sell me access to hit games like the sci-fi shooting title Borderlands, playable through a PC, Mac or a little set-top box and a controller.

Just like with Netflix, all I had to do was log in, choose what I wanted to play, and start. Sometimes the visuals would garble, just like they did back then with movie streaming too. But it worked. It felt like the future.

I’ve been waiting for that future ever since.

OnLive eventually shut down in 2015, but other contenders have popped up. Sony launched its PlayStation Now streaming game service in 2014, as a compliment to its popular PlayStation 4 game console. Microsoft and Electronic Arts, meanwhile, have said they’re developing competing services as well, though they haven’t offered firm launch dates. Even Comcast, the TV and internet provider, has dabbled in game streaming, most recently considering a purchase of the Korean game company Nexon, rumors say. 

All these companies are betting that the streaming approach will eventually upend the way we play video games, much in the same way Netflix did our movie watching a decade ago. The question is when.

“What’s good is in this industry is you can play on mobile or PC, and now it’s starting to be the same game,” said Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, who’s been working with Google on streaming game technology for six years. “It’s one more possibility to experience the worlds we create and it gives opportunities to creators to take full advantage of mobile.”

A new promise

Google pitched its service as a way to bring together different people in the game industry, including players, streamers and coders. The company said it’s developed ways for people to start playing a game after clicking a link in YouTube, for example. 

Google has also partnered with game developers like Epic Games and Unity. As a result, Google’s high-performance servers will stream games at up to 4K ultrahigh-definition video at 60 frames per second, meaning animations should move smoothly. 

Already, Google said, Stadia is able to deliver games with more performance than Microsoft’s Xbox One X and Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro combined. And Google said it eventually expects to double that performance as game developers create even more complex games.

Google won’t rely just on other game makers though. The company said it’ll follow Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo in building its own specialized games for its service, through a studio called Stadia Games and Entertainment.

“We are on the brink of a huge revolution in gaming,” said Jade Raymond, head of Google’s game making group and an industry veteran.

For its part, Microsoft said in a statement that it’s “a great time to a gamer,” and noted that it’s devoted to offering choice as well through its upcoming Project xCloud service. Sony and Nintendo didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In the meantime, Google said it plans to closely knit its game service with YouTube, offering new ways for people to compete and play with one another. That was particularly exciting to Matthew Patrick, a popular YouTube gaming personality known as MatPat.

“It unites technology and entertainment in ways we’ve never seen before,” he said.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is creating a “premium games subscription” service for the App Store. Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft’s xCloud, Apple’s service is not cloud-based.

Instead, it will focus on iPhones and iPads and bundle together paid games from different developers that consumers can access for a monthly fee,“ Bloomberg reported.

One source said Apple will pay developers based on how much time users spend playing their title. The report goes on to claim that the service would only feature paid games, not free-to-play titles. The report also says the service may not be announced on Monday, but instead during its developer conference in June. That timing would be intriguing, as it’s just before E3.

According to analyst Serkan Toto, this kind of package offering is already available in Japan. He also points out that, if free-to-play games are indeed excluded, then Nintendo’s upcoming Mario Kart Tour wouldn’t be eligible. As you may recall, Apple partnered with Nintendo in a big way to promote and release the free-to-play Mario game Super Mario Run.

Problem is: if the article is to be believed, F2P content is excluded.
For Mario Kart Tour, both Nintendo and DeNA confirmed (not only one time) it will not be a paid game.
Let’s see.

Project Stream was a proof-of-concept in collaboration with Ubisoft, to see whether AAA gaming was possible over the internet. Things were smooth most of the time in our own experience, but there remained questions over how the concept would translate over to a finished product, especially with infrastructure challenges on the client side of things. Google's keynote at GDC just wrapped up, and the main focus was Stadia- the now named cloud gaming service borne out of Project Stream. Stadia is built with instant access in mind. An example demo came in the form of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which was used in the public test before. It is integrated with partner YouTube channels such that a trailer for a supported game would have an option to play said game, which would then launch immediately. Stadia is built with support from a wide partner network including AMD, Unity, id Software, and more, with details seen past the break. Game streaming usually means support for multiple devices, given the backend hosts the actual game processing itself. Stadia is no different, with support for a variety for products including PCs, phones, tablet, and TVs (smart or otherwise via products such as Google's Chromecast). The current limitation is support for Google's Chrome browser, although Google mentioned that they are working to support other browsers as well. Most controllers as well as the keyboard + mouse combination, and Google is also bringing out a dedicated Stadia controller for those who prefer first-party support. The Stadia controller will come in three color options, is reminiscent of the XBOX controller, and connects via WiFi directly to the game being streamed. It also has a dedicated capture button to share content on YouTube, as well as a Google Assistant button to access the built-in mic for, well, Google Assistant. The backend is no doubt critical here, with Google promising over 7500 nodes around the world to combat latency as best as possible. Each node, or Stadia instance as they are calling it, uses datacenters comprising multiple racks filled with custom hardware developed in collaboration with AMD. The hardware includes a GPU providing 10.7 TFlops compute (based on AMD's Vega microarchitecture, presumably), a custom x86 processor clocked at 2.7 GHz with hyperthreading, and 16 GB of RAM, which all pair together to provide a single node well more powerful than the Sony PS4 Pro or the Microsoft XBOX One X- even combined. But raw numbers mean little if developers can't optimize for it, however, and this will no doubt be a challenge. Google is promising a massive improvement in gameplay experience with Stadia, going from the up to 1080p/60 FPS/stereo sound setup from Project Stream to 4K/60 FPS/HDR/surround sound at launch with Stadia, and further improvements targeting 8K gameplay in the future. This is paired with instant streaming of games so you can show viewers what you are playing, and others can watch you live. This enables YouTube to be a bigger competitor to Twitch than it currently is, and no doubt another move in Google's arsenal to take over the internet. AMD is one of many, many partners Google is working with to make Stadia a success, with other partners brought up on stage to talk about what else is coming out. Doom Eternal, for example, is ready for Stadia and capable of hitting the launch specifications of 4K HDR at 60 FPS. Unity and Unreal game engines are getting native support, and there are others listed as seen below. Google Assistant can come in handy here too, for seamless integration to figure out a game navigation problem, for example, as demonstrated with Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Google is promising full parental control for those who need it, but also full cross-platform play and multi-player. No cheating is a definite plus point in this case, given the whole concept of game streaming. Game developers will have tools available to enable a wide range of view options for multi-player gameplay, demonstrated by Google's Night Forest demo, and also the ability to easily style games using palettes and art backgrounds. Google is also creating a new Stadia Games and Entertainment division to build experiences and work with developers and partners to ensure a continuous stream of content. Stadia launches in 2019 in the US, Canada, UK, and Europe, but there are no more details available yet on pricing, launch date, and the content available at launch. Google promises to have another session in the summer to share these details, which gives time for people to make up their mind on whether Stadia is for them or not. The US especially has datacaps on most internet plans, and this is before input lag and gameplay latency comes into play. Summer 2019 is also when E3 happens, which has been nerfed this year by the absence of Sony and EA. This year is also especially important given many are expecting to hear more about the next generation of game consoles, so Stadia will be an alternative to many who simply want to play without dealing more into the logistics of it. There are also other such game streaming options coming out or already available in one form or another- be it NVIDIA's GeForce Now, Steam Link Anywhere, Microsoft's Wireless Display app, or others. Let us know in the comments what you think, and keep in mind that it is early to make a conclusion one way or another on Stadia at this stage- especially without more details on pricing and content.

I won't trust them with my payment information until I'm convinced that that has been fixed.

cea52fee-d04e-428e-a040-954edef9fba6,3/20/2019,https://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=32079902#32079902,"Google Just Showed Us the Future of Gaming Data centers could make individual game consoles obsolete Eric Ravenscraft Medium Mar 19 Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty On Tuesday at GDC 2019, Google announced Stadia, a new game-streaming service that will let you play AAA video games—the industry’s blockbusters—on almost every device you own, including your laptop, phone, TV, or even a Chromecast. If it works as advertised—a big “if”—it could end the gaming hardware market as we know it. With Stadia, which is slated to launch later this year, Google is aiming for nothing less than entirely detaching video games from the hardware you own. Instead of downloading a game to your computer or putting a disc in your console, the game would be installed on a remote server that Google owns and operates. You won’t have to buy a new console or build a new PC to run the latest generation of games. Instead, Google can upgrade Stadia servers entirely behind the scenes. You’ll just wake up one day and find that you can play games with better graphics. This presumably means high-end gaming is about to get a lot cheaper—a top-of-the-line PlayStation 4 Pro costs about $400—though Google declined to share pricing details with OneZero . We don’t tend to think about it too much, but video games have an unusually intimate connection with the hardware they run on. Every few years, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and PC hardware manufacturers release new devices that add more power and features to the games you play. Microsoft made 4K gaming possible with the Xbox One X , NVIDIA launched graphics cards capable of ray tracing , and Nintendo had that weird expansion pack that made Donkey Kong 64 not crash. For as long as they’ve existed, video games and their hardware have been intrinsically linked. Think The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time , for instance, and you’ll picture the Nintendo 64 it ran on. But while this relationship is widely accepted in gaming, the same isn’t true for most other kinds of software. A professional video editor might need a better machine to squeeze more out of Adobe Premiere, but no one has to upgrade their phone every couple years to use Gmail or buy a new laptop to run the latest version of Microsoft Word. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty This kind of cloud gaming service has been tried many times before, from the failed OnLive to PlayStation Now and to the still-in-beta NVIDIA GeForce Now . But two key factors set Google’s attempt apart. First, you may already own a device capable of running Stadia. GeForce Now is the closest to this platform-agnostic dream, with support for both Mac and Windows computers, but Stadia goes a step further by including Chromebooks, phones, and even the modest Chromecast streaming device. If you have a gadget capable of running YouTube, Google says you can play the newest high-end games using Stadia. Second, the servers these games will run on are owned by Google. And Google is very good at building servers . Video games, especially the visually rich AAA games that most modern consoles can play, are among the most resource-hungry applications any computer can run . For an individual player, keeping up with the pace of hardware innovation can be a Sisyphean task—and an obscenely expensive one at that. For Google, upgrading massive systems with the latest hardware is done routinely. Consider the current gold standard of gaming: 4K resolution, running at 60 frames per second. If you have a 4K TV today, you have a few options available to play games that can get the most out of it. You can buy an Xbox One X or a PlayStation 4 Pro , or you could build a PC capable of playing 4K games. According to Google, Stadia will launch with support for playing games at 4K HDR at 60 fps right off the bat. For a new service launching in 2019, perhaps that’s to be expected. However, the company went a step further, announcing that it would scale up to 8K and 120 fps in the future. The company didn’t give a timeline for when this would happen, but since the first consumer-level 8K TVs were only just announced this year, few consumers are likely to be in any rush. This approach also removes the roadblock for more subtle innovations. For example, NVIDIA’s new ray-tracing graphics cards simulate the way light works in the real world, creating instant shadows and realistic reflections and simplifying a lot of the work game developers have to do to make a game look good. The benefit is so immediately obvious that it spawned its own meme . But ray tracing presents a problem for game developers: It only works on NVIDIA graphics cards that support the feature. The company is expanding the list of supported cards , but that still leaves a potential audience that’s limited to a subset of PC gamers who have a small selection of relatively high-end graphics cards. With such a minuscule audience, few outside of the biggest studios will invest resources into developing games for it. It’s just not worth it yet. Were that technology to be incorporated into Stadia servers, however, the potential audience would be massive. Instead of waiting for consumers to slowly migrate to new hardware, bigger and better games can be shipped as soon as Google’s data servers are upgraded. Companies like NVIDIA would also be more likely to sell their new high-end hardware directly to Google, rather than trying to incrementally sell $600-plus cards to average consumers. There are still a lot of potential stumbling blocks for Stadia. The biggest bottleneck is home internet speeds , which, in the United States, have not always had the bandwidth to support something as intense as 4K game streaming. There’s also the price: $20 a month for access to a library of games?—?as is the case for PlayStation Now ?—?might be reasonable, but if the company makes users pay separately for additional features like 4K streaming or ray tracing, it might end up a wash compared to just buying a console. What’s not in question is the earth-shattering effect Stadia will have on gaming hardware in the home if the service works as advertised. To use a soon-to-be-timely pop culture analogy, the industry has resembled the endlessly turning wheel of power in Westeros that Daenerys Targaryen describes in Games of Thrones : Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, NVIDIA, each taking their turn on top with successive and expensive upgrades. Consumers have accepted the need to buy new consoles or graphics cards every few years, because there has been no other way to play the latest games. In a world where you can play the newest Tomb Raider in perfect 4K HDR on something as simple as a Chromecast, however, the endlessly turning wheel of hardware upgrades won’t just stop—it will break altogether. onezero.medium.com",,Glenn Petersen,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,32079902,,,

For example, in this case Naughty Dog is owned by Sony, so whether they make a profit on the game itself or not, they're gonna profit in other ways. Uncharted 4 for example was PS4's 3rd bestselling game ever, but even that is just 8.7M units. Did it turn a profit? Sure, but not a huge one on the game itself. God of War for all it's accolades sold just 5M copies. Did it turn a profit after development and marketing costs? Probably not. Maybe it broke even. But again, you can get away with those numbers on a console-only game as they make up for that in PS4 sales, PSPlus & PSNow subscriptions. So in the case of companies like EA (who are multiplatform), their profits are tied to the game itself. Something else to consider, but what I would think would be obvious, is that Sony is both a hardware and software manufacturer. They have a wealth of money to allow for purely single player focused games, in addition to letting their games take time before launching. Even in the case of independent studios like CDPR, they've got GoG.com to back them up financially, as well as the Polish government. GOG is in financial trouble. Looks like the Epic store might be hurting them. According to one laid off staff member ""revenue couldn't keep up with growth"" and ""that we're dangerously close to being in the red has come up in the last few months"".

One thing that stood out in the Stadia presentation was when he said “Streaming has changed the music industry”. Sure, it changed the music industry - but more accurately, it destroyed the music industry because artists and labels didn’t partner with Napster when they had the chance. Will be interesting to see how this plays out, but by the sounds of it this looks to be a new architecture for an entire industry.

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Wait so if I paid £19.99 for my years subscription I could play FIFA for free?

183509915750,3/17/2019,http://cryptswahili.tumblr.com/post/183509915750,"GPU-based cryptocurrency miners have taken a beating throughout this bear market — just ask NVIDIA. However, users with spare GPUs may soon be able to put their ineffective mining hardware to another profitable use: renting rendering power to those looking to experience quality PC gaming on an underpowered computer. 

As reported by TechCrunch, Vectordash is looking to allow people with underpowered rigs not meant for gaming — such as Apple computers — to experience quality PC gaming with the help of individuals willing to rent their spare power for cloud rendering. This means that, in theory, even those with a Macbook Air could game at 4K resolution and 60 frames-per-second, given their internet bandwidth is capable of handling that amount of data.

If this sounds too good to be true, it’s not. Cloud rendering itself is nothing particularly new, so this idea is far from half-baked. Sony launched a cloud rendering service in PlayStation Now years ago — though it never really took off. Nevertheless, the company proved that cloud rendering is a viable option for gaming going forward.

Vectordash’s service will apparently run users $28 per month for cloud rendering capabilities. On the other side of the deal, GPU renters stand to make about $0.60 per day — which isn’t life-changing money for anyone who has the dough to throw at high-powered GPUs. However, the ability to put less-than-profitable meant-for-mining GPUs to work for another reason may help those who have been beaten down by both a bear market and dramatically more powerful ASIC mining rigs.



The key for Vectordash, of course, is offering payments for renters that are competitively priced with cryptocurrency mining returns — which shouldn’t be too difficult, given that GPU mining returns are currently negligible.

What do you think about Vectordash and cloud rendering PC games? Do you have GPUs you bought for cryptocurrency mining that you no longer use? Let us know in the comments below!

 [ad_1]


One of the big announcements that Apple could make during its reveal event on Monday is a new video game service. According to Bloomberg, Apple is creating a “premium games subscription” service for the App Store. Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft’s xCloud, Apple’s service is not cloud-based.

Instead, it will focus on iPhones and iPads and…

So porting a game from Windows to Xbox and vice versa wouldn't be too hard since experience from one platform carries onto the other.

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » I haven't tried a game streaming service, so I'm kind of curious about the latency and speed of light issues that people were talking about. Is it something that makes tons of games simply unplayable for anyone who's ever gone into a settings menu, or does the latency just mean that you maybe don't get a good experience with the twitchiest games, like competitive shooters and fighting games? Armchair seemed to suggest that this would mostly only be useful for turn based games, but people indicated they were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey well enough, and it seems like PSNow has been doing it since 2014. Are streamed games just garbage to play over PSNow, or is it not as bad as all that? I played AC:O on Stream and it worked really well. I was using 100mbps wired Fios. I went in there specifically to test the latency and I'd say it matched my expectations of what a best-case scenario looks like for the tech. i.e. if you watch the screen closely as you press a button on the controller you'll definitely see it, and it's not my preference to sacrifice any input latency, but I could easily play the game that way and get used to it. A lamen player who isn't technical enough to be looking for latency probably would not notice it. That's on a controller though, using mouselook I really didn't like it. Even a casual player might notice the difference there compared to moving a mouse cursor on their computer. As I said before, KBAM is just objectively more precise than controllers can be. It's not a value judgement or a preference call when I say ""objectively more precise."" Think directional movements. With a keyboard, it's all or nothing. On or off. Controllers have far more granularity in left stick control than WASD, and it's there that you can get away with slightly slower control response because people just don't switch finger positions, they're moving a stick over a plane which can take time. Right stick controls are way less precise than a mouse. A mouse has a huge surface area it can move and nearly infinite different speeds, utilizing your entire arm for the movement, whereas sticks are just kind of a general thing that makes use of acceleration. Combine the two and input lag is fundamentally going to be more noticeable. Sure, I do agree that KB+M is incompatible with streaming except for the most casual of players. It would work okay for cursor-driven games with a client-rendered cursor, like RTSes, but that's about it. That said, KB+M is a dying breed - the only players who prefer that over a controller are the ones buying gaming PCs. So that doesn't worry me for the success of these services. Gaming PCs are resurging in recent years thanks to Twitch. It's not a dying breed, KBAM is on the rise if anything. It's what all the pros are using. Mechanical keyboards and excellent gaming mice are also coming out faster than I can keep track. Even the consoles are getting in on it. KB+M is quite the opposite of dying, not least as you can use it for document work or whatever when you ain't gaming. KB+M support on consoles is kind of an oddity, I would not say it's a rising trend. More of a thing for people who want to use their console on their desk as if it were a PC. Also anecdotally I think controller usage on PC has been on the rise for years compared to KB+M; increasingly more people are just switching to controllers full time because it's more comfortable and they can play in the living room. Shooters are becoming increasingly friendly towards controllers these days as they aim for crossplay like Fortnite. So you can expect to see more online shooters giving consideration for fairness by tweaking the auto-aim etc. Anyway I digress - yeah, PC gamers use KB+M for shooters more often than not. My point though is that those people aren't Stadia's audience - they have gaming PCs already, they have no use for streaming. Maybe in the future they could choose to switch to streaming rather than upgrade their PC, but if they do then they'll probably have to switch to using a controller. It's a rising trend given that, up until recently, it didn't exist at all on consoles. Developers were loathe to mix KBAM with controllers -- it seems like Fortnite kind of broke that wave, but consoles supporting keyboards for use in games period is new and as such, yeah I'd say it's on the rise. And, anecdotally, Sea of Thieves recently allowed XB1 players to opt out of playing with KBAM users due to the advantages they were giving up when PvPing against them, Fiatil at 12:40AM",,Fiatil,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,[Google Stadia] Stream all your games anywhere! - Page 16,,,

Personally I still enjoyed my time with the game. I've played every numbered disgaea game besides 3 or 4 and going from 5 to 3 was kinda rough but it wasn't THAT bad. Granted, I didn't touch post game stuff and probably never will. Also I didn't mind the mana skill system as much as other people did, I still prefer the way D1,d2, dd2 and d5's did it though. ​ Also speaking of 3 the first thing I noticed when playing was the fact that there was team attacks with a ton of skills (i.e. mao does blade rush, almaz does spinning swords, they both fuse into one team attack) I wonder why they didn't bring this feature back? Now it seems like there's only specific team attacks you can do. ​ Now I'm trying out D4, I'm liking it much more so far.",,Cloak007,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.

If we get vr to an affordable level, get wireless connectivity to it and actually make game engines that run it well, then I think it’ll be fukkin amazing",,silent-fetish,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

But I have never had any video game affect me this much. Chapters 1-6 were just pure art and masterful storytelling. By the time I got control of John, I just couldn’t do it. I needed a break. I miss Arthur already goddammit. I was on the fence about getting PSNOW to play RDR1 for the first time after I beat the epilogue, but now I absolutely have to. I’m craving this story and I don’t want to even touch another game until I see what happens to John. When I picked this game up, I just didn’t expect to be so heavy; so goddamn emotional. It’s a western so I expected shooting and violence, but not this. And it’s all in the little details, the small quotes, the stranger missions, the camp conversations. Arthur Morgan is probably the most fleshed out video game character I’ve ever played, and I feel weird about even playing as John. And goddamn I miss him. How did you guys get back to playing as Arthur after the epilogue? Is it better just to reload an old save, or start a new game? Any advantages of either? And I’ve heard negative things about the mission replay system, but is it good for at least going back and reliving some of the story moments? I don’t know if you guys have ever had outside interference at just the worst possible moments, but during the last few missions my little kitten decided it would be a great time to destroy the fuckin’ apartment, I got the hiccups, and my drunk girlfriend got home. So I was super distracted which was horrible and badly timed, but I still felt the weight of everything. However, it wasn’t until the next day that everything really hit me because I was slightly angry at the time. Anyways, time to finish the epilogue. I was going to ask if there are a lot of new stuff in the epilogue and how long it took you guys? Is there a decent amount of stuff I get to carry over? Is there anything else I should know about this part of the game? Lastly, I know I’m late to the party so you fellers that have been here for awhile are probably sick of these conversations, but I would love to hear some of your insight on chapter 6. Thoughts, feelings, opinions. It was kind of sad and funny, but I lost TWO of my main horses before the last missions started. Two. Fuck trains and the Murfree Brood. So I just had a random horse during the Red Dead Redemption mission, and it wasn’t as impactful when Arthur said “Thank you.” Although it was frustrating because that’s three goddamn horses in 10ish hours. It was still an amazing moment though. I just pretended it was Miss Pearl III that he was saying thank you to. My favorite moment though was when Arthur kept telling Micah “I’ve already won.” It made me feel like he actually did. I mean he was half dead and almost beat Micah and killed him, imagine if he was at full strength! Shows what a little bitch Micah is. And that final scene with the sun was amazing. Despite the circumstances, I feel like it was a good way to go. I feel like Arthur really did get redemption. Anyways, if you made it this far, hi! Hello! Thanks for reading my ramblings. I’m emotional right now and talking about this shit helps. Have a good day, Boahs.",,JJJtrain_1989,United States of America,,,Positive,Sadness,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Imaging playing a fast-paced shooter in which your aiming/shooting is delayed, or even a racing game in which you must turn AHEAD of time due to the latency. Anyone who ever tried OnLive knows exactly what I'm talking about. Bandwidth caps from companies like Comcast will also present enormous problems. Bottom line: This is a great idea, but too far ahead of its time just like OnLive. We just don't have the infrastructure to properly support it. ====================::==================== After testing all the major game streaming services (Shadow Tech, Steam, Moonlight, OnLive, Nvidia Geforce Now, Playstation Now, etc.) on various different platforms (gaming laptop, gaming desktop, tablet, and smart phone) I've come to the conclusion that the streaming gaming platform is only for specific Users. If you game on a 120hz+ display with 5msrt or less, this isn't for you. You will feel like you're playing in mud. If you're a competitive FPS gamer, this isn't for you. For people that like to couch game, play single player stuff, or sports games, AND have a 100mbps+ this will do amazing things. HOWEVER, if you've never gamed on a 144hz display or don't know what MSRT means, this might be for you. These streaming platforms provide high-end PC gaming for a low entry cost. The quality of the stream and responsiveness is amazing, but even with a 500mpbs connection it will feel like 150ms-200ms input lag Anyone sensitive to response time will feel the delay.

Casual gamers may use a streaming platform because “why not”, but once they realize the shortcomings they’ll stop subscribing. Games need to be stored locally in 2019, plain and simple. Again, this is a corporate pipe dream. In TheoriticaLand, streaming is great. We don’t live in TheoreticaLand unfortunately. Have you used any of the 2019 game-streaming services? The two I know of are Nvidia's and Google's. I don't know what serious shortcomings there are. As for local storage, the problem is every game is like 40GiB plus several installments of 30GiB patches now for some reason, and people don't want to wait for downloads.

183572605830,3/19/2019,http://eduardobutton.tumblr.com/post/183572605830,"While neither company has commented on it, Reddit chatter started ramping up over the possibility of EA Access coming to the PlayStation 4. The service is currently exclusive to the Xbox One, though an expansion to other platforms was always possible. However, when it was originally announced, Sony made it very clear at the time it was not interested.

Despite that, Sony has made it clear in the past year that it’s willing to change face on a number of long-standing positions. From cross-play to PSN IDs, things that at once seemed impossible now seem very much possible. But, the question remains, is EA Access on the PlayStation 4 a good idea?

There are some definite heavy-hitters on this list. For $30 a month, you’ll definitely get some bang for your buck. Yes, some recent titles like Anthem and Battlefield V aren’t currently on the platform, but they will almost definitely be added at some point.It already has games like Battlefield 1 and the most recent EA Sports titles, DLC and all. In addition, getting limited-time trials is a selling point of its own, as you’ll be able to test out EA’s newest releases without shelling out $60.
 WATCH GALLERY 
However, a PS4 version of EA Access does come with some caveats. EA Access gives you the ability to download games, not stream them. A lot of the titles on the service are Xbox 360/PS3 games, like the original Mass Effect trilogy and Dead Space 1-3. The Xbox One is notable for its backwards compatibility, and every previous-gen game on the service is backwards compatible. Obviously, that’s not something that will be possible on the PlayStation 4.

It’s a problem that even Sony’s own streaming service, PlayStation Now, has encountered. The service lets you download PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 4 games, but not PlayStation 3 titles. Now, there are plenty of current-gen titles that can fill up the library. But one has to ask why Sony would be willing to host a service that will most definitely be scaled down on its platform? To answer that, we may want to look ahead.

By all accounts, the PlayStation 5 will have backwards compatibility. Now, how far back that will go is a question, but there are rumblings that all games from all PlayStation systems will be playable. It definitely seems like a lot of decisions Sony has made lately are table-setting for the PS5. Allowing EA Access on its platform has the same kind of energy to it.

The next generations of systems are widely expected to be released in 2020. With that, Sony and Microsoft have begun to make decisions for the long-term, to make their next systems as attractive as possible. EA Access finally coming to a Sony platform seems like one of those decisions. If backwards compatibility is indeed a thing, what better way to celebrate it than having some of the PS3’s most defining titles available to download?

EA may get a lot of criticism, but it is a publisher with a fantastic library. Giving easy access to that library, at a cost lower than it is to buy most AAA games, is great for customers. The library will only grow stronger over time, and if backwards compatibility on the PS5 is real, then it would be a huge steal.

The industry's biggest players have made that decision and stepped up the enormous investment in technology and infrastructure required to make it into a reality. Sony's PlayStation Now has been slowly evolving in the background with fairly little fanfare; now Microsoft's xCloud has taken an important step forward with a live demo, supposedly a lead-in to public trials later this year. The other shoe whose dropping many pundits are eagerly anticipating belongs to Google, and that will hit the floor at GDC next week. The company has hinted at a gaming announcement more significant than anything it's done in the space so far -- hardware may be on the table but it's widely expected that a streaming service will be the main dish, with anything physical being in the form of controllers or streaming boxes to support the service. As the notion of a ""Netflix for Games"" service takes root, all of the major players are positioning themselves to make sure they get their slice of the pie. On the surface, this puts Sony and Microsoft right onto a collision course with Google -- and it also raises big questions about what other market players will do to ensure they're not left out. https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articl...wars-opinion_1",,wraggster,United Kingdom,East Midlands,Nottingham,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Kicking off the streaming wars,,,

183701312425,3/25/2019,http://appenza.tumblr.com/post/183701312425,"At this year’s Game Developer Conference in San Francisco last week, Google finally pulled the curtain back on one of the worst kept secrets in gaming: Google Stadia, its games streaming service. This article does a capable job of explaining what the Stadia is, but in a nutshell: Stadia is a cloud-based games streaming service that allows players to interact with video games instantly, without downloading anything, on their tablets, laptops, televisions, and mobile phones so long as their internet connection is sufficiently fast. Some specific hardware requirements, such as the fact that Stadia will not work on non-Pixel Android phones at launch, have dampened the lofty aspirations of the service, though.

Stadia isn’t the first ambitious cloud-based games streaming service to come to market: OnLive somewhat infamously was sold for less than $5MM after raising more than $50MM in financing and reaching a peak valuation of nearly $2BN. Gaikai fared better with a $380MM sale to Sony in 2012 and now allegedly powers the “Playstation Now” service, and GameFly acquired Playcast in 2015 to deliver what it called a “Netflix for Games” service.

That term is important, as it has become something of a popular call to arms lately as a number of different companies, from Microsoft to Amazon to Apple to Electronic Arts and a subsidiary of Rovio, have announced products that could be deemed a “Netflix of Gaming”. And in fact, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s CEO, may have tipped his hand for such an endeavor from Netflix itself when he stated that the company “compete(s) with (and lose(s) to) Fortnite more than HBO. When YouTube went down globally for a few minutes in October, (Netflix’s) viewing and signups spiked for that time.”

Almost nothing is known about how Stadia will source content, what it will cost to use, what requirements will be placed on developers in order to have their games appear on the platform, etc. Former Ubisoft executive Jade Raymond recently joined Google to head an internal first-party studio to make games for Stadia, but it’s unknown how large that studio will be or how many games it will publish per year. Google will surely expect to lean heavily on third-party developers for content on the Stadia at launch and for the foreseeable future. As Netflix would certify, being the Netflix of something is expensive: the company is expected to spend $15BN on content in 2019.

And indeed, as this article asserts, the Stadia may be more of a YouTube strategy than a games streaming strategy — or, at least, the Stadia may serve the purpose of further aggrandizing YouTube as games streaming goes mainstream. 50BN hours of gameplay footage were watched on YouTube in 2018, and 200MM people watch gameplay footage each day on YouTube: YouTube is an important part of the gaming ecosystem, and Stadia unifies the viewing experience and the first-hand playing experience in a way that could create a powerful virtuous circle between first-person and third-person gaming engagement. Players will be able to drop pins into gameplay footage on YouTube and then immediately open the game at that moment and start playing. Likewise, players will be able to seamlessly switch between devices, retaining their in situ game state.

It is that last capability that could perhaps be the most monumental promise of Stadia: if every game is playable on a mobile device (all computation is done in the cloud, so end-user hardware profile is irrelevant), then every game is a mobile game. And the Stadia effectively distintermediates the app stores: with Stadia, there is no download requirement in playing a game, and the click-to-stream mechanism effectively extends game discovery to the entire surface area of the web. If game distribution escapes the app stores, then the entire mobile advertising ecosystem could become upended, with a critical pain point — the click-to-install conversion dynamic — being circumvented and otherwise poorly-converting ad inventory like mobile web banners, interstitials, and, conveniently for Google, YouTube inventory becoming suddenly very interesting to mobile advertisers.

This could be a very interesting development. The mobile app ecosystem has been trending toward intermediation as the biggest mobile properties start to look more and more like app stores themselves; Stadia could change that by abstracting away the idea of an app store, at least as games are concerned. Of course, a vast amount of territory exists between now and Stadia being a hugely successful platform that has materially, indelibly changed the landscape of the mobile app ecosystem. Stadia is a complex, ambitious undertaking, so of course it could fall; it’s frankly annoying that so many media commentators elect to vocalize that very obvious fact.

But if the Stadia is successful, it will have a massive impact on the way that smartphone users interact with games. That possibility is intriguing.

183635348540,3/22/2019,http://pixelpoppers.tumblr.com/post/183635348540,"Google has announced that they are creating a streaming games platform called Stadia. The idea is you won’t need a console or even necessarily a controller if you already have a compatible one (and most modern console controllers appear to be compatible). You’ll be able to play games right in a browser on your TV/phone/tablet/PC via streaming. No extra download/installation required. Basically, it’s Netflix, except instead of streaming movies or TV, you’re streaming a video game and streaming back your controller inputs.

It’s worth noting that very little consumer-useful information is available yet. Nothing about how pricing will work (all-you-can-eat subscription like Netflix? rent games like the original PlayStation Now model? ad-based like YouTube? some combo?) or how expensive it’ll be. They’re also advertising it as capable of doing 4k video at 60fps - which would require an amount of bandwidth that’s implausibly high for most people’s internet connections.

But they have some big names on board - Doom Eternal and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey are confirmed for the service, and they’ve got Jade Raymond (creator of Assassin’s Creed) heading their in-house development studio where they will be developing first-party (probably exclusive?) titles.

With that background, here are my thoughts. 

 * This is far from the first attempt to create and popularize a game streaming service. Most of them have failed, and the common cause is that we just aren’t there yet from a tech and infrastructure standpoint. I mentioned how most people’s internet connections aren’t good enough to stream 4k video at 60fps, but even if you reduce those numbers it’s kind of crazy. Something like YouTube or Netflix has the benefit of being able to buffer video and thus ride out blips in the traffic - a game that needs to constantly react to your inputs doesn’t have that luxury.
 While Google is one of the best-positioned companies to overcome these kinds of barriers, there’s only so much they can do. I find it unlikely that even Stadia will be a consistently good playing experience for most people any time soon. (But as we’ll get to soon, that might not matter.) 
 * It’s my opinion that the reason so many companies have tried to make game streaming work despite the challenges is because it could be a really lucrative approach if it pays off. I touched on this in my most recent article but the more the publisher controls the game experience, the more money they can milk from it. I didn’t mention there that it also increases the analytics they can pull from it - think of something like the YouTube recommendation algorithm being applied to game design, fueled by every single input the player makes over the course of entire games. 
 * As also discussed in my article, I generally think the relocation of control from player to publisher is a bad thing. It worsens the game experience, it reduces ownership, and it makes preservation more difficult. Games preservation is already a very difficult proposition; streamed games become basically impossible to preserve. I’ve been dreading the day that streaming is viable enough to take over the AAA space. 
 * This is going way out there into wild speculation, but the name Stadia implies a focus on spectating, such as for esports or livestreamers. Twitch/YouTube/Amazon/etc. are already competing in this space. Any game played via Stadia will probably be best (and maybe only) spectatable via Stadia. It’s pretty easy on Google’s end to just also send the video/audio to other clients - and not have to wait on inputs sent back. Which means for spectators it’s basically YouTube, and we’re back to being able to buffer around connection dips if we have a few-seconds delay, which is already normal for streaming.
 Thus it’s plausible that the near-term business model is for high-profile streamers or tournament organizers to have good setups for playing via Stadia, and everyone else just needs normal-ish connections to be able to spectate. In which case it doesn’t matter if most people’s internet isn’t good enough to get the most use out of Stadia yet.
 Presumably in this case there would be built-in ways to subscribe/support individual streamers or pay to watch tournaments, and surely Google would take a cut. No esports-friendly games like that have yet been announced for Stadia, but this is very early days. They may not want to tip their hand just yet. 
 * On the other hand, if there are exclusives on Stadia that I care about, I appreciate that I’ll be able to try them without buying a console. There are a couple Xbox One-only games I want to play, but not enough to justify buying one, so I’m unlikely to ever play them.",,pixelpoppers,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Early Thoughts on Google Stadia,Post,,

It runs like a dream, the players are courteous (mostly) and everyone seems to be on an almost even footing skill-wise. Obviously there are the obligatory god-tier and noob-tier players but all in all its well balanced. 2)The PC version of the game is the “big leagues”. Almost every time I play I lose because the guys in this version are almost all god-tier. Its fun to just see what insane way you’re going to die this time. I can mainly avoid getting salty on the PC version because everyone is just so impressive. 3) The Xbox One version of the game is the skid marks on the underpants of Apex Legends. It performs like a brick in the grand national. It is laggy, glitchy and borderline unplayable. Most of the players don’t know which end of the gun is supposed to point at the enemy but even then they’ll still manage to kill you as you lag into another dimension and empty a whole clip into the air where an enemy was 4 games ago. Seriously, its insane how badly this version plays compared to the other two. I didn’t even realise it until I tried playing the game on the PS4 and realised “omg, I don’t suck!” Seriously Respawn, this needs fixing and it needs fixing fast. My main account is on the xbox but its just so hard to play that I almost exclusively play on the playstation now which is very hard to do seeing as the playstation normally has my GF playing on it (I am now level 5 since launch on the PS4, GF is in the 80’s). Anyone else have multiple versions of the game and noticed this too? Or even disagree? I really hope the Xbox version gets a fix soon because I’d love to be able to continue to play the game on my console of choice but at the moment I can only get a couple of games in a day before rage quitting. Respawn, please send help. You can find me stuck in a door in the bunker waiting for someone to put me out my misery (like usual).",,Burgurple,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

If they had things like Horizon Zero Dawn or God Of War, it'd be worth subscribing to for a few months. I get what you are saying. I'm not trying to be obtuse.....but what are they going to do, make the tablet hover in the air in front of their eyes while they play on the controller? The controller on the switch attaches to the side to combat that. Will they have to play these games on a touchscreen? I don't know what the solution to that is, unless you have to play at a table with the tablet set up and the controller separate and in your hand. How will they play on the bus? None of this is explained. Touch screen is not an acceptable controller solution. If they have to buy a tablet with controller ports, then that IS hardware. How can a tablet be like the switch? I know these things seem insignificant, but part of the beauty of the Switch is that all these problems are solved for you. I guess you could epoxy the controller to the tablet, or buy a big bulky controller case(or just buy a switch).

183759440503,3/27/2019,http://bloggiemcbloggerson.tumblr.com/post/183759440503,"Google unveiled its very own video game streaming service at this year’s Game Developers Conference (GDC 2019) and no one gives a hoot.

The Google Stadia is a downloadable service that is supposed to put an end to gaming consoles once and for all; (un)fortunately no one sees it that way. Where the Stadia differs from other gaming platforms is that it doesn’t use hardware, and you can’t download games you can only stream them. It’s a subscription based service that allows you to stream all the video games in their library, think Netflix but for video games.

 I have been a hardcore gamer for as long I can remember; I could beat World 1 of Super Mario Bros. 3 before my 3rd birthday. Using my insight as a lifelong consumer of video games I have found several reasons why this service is not very appealing to anyone.  

Problem 1: Nothing you are paying for is your own. At the end of your subscription you won’t have a single game to your name just a big hole in your wallet. 

Problem 2: The cost. Netflix is $12 per month, but considering you could buy 5 new movies for the price of a single new video game the chances the service will cost more is high. Video Games aren’t cheap to make.

Problem 3: No internet, no games. If your internet goes down, so does your game. This would be rage inducing if your internet went down for a minute in the middle of a boss fight and you forgot to save. If your internet goes down for a week, that means no games for a week.


Problem 4: Heavy use of Bandwidth. Sure I might not need to buy a PS4, but I still need to pay for internet with no bandwidth cap, which many ISP don’t even offer. This service doesn’t let you download any of the games, you can only steam them. Meaning the game itself might end up using more data to play than it would if you could just download the whole thing at once. Pricey and wasteful.

Problem 5: This service already exists, it does it better, and it’s still a worthless garbage fire. Playstation Now is a subscription based Video Game Streaming service that allows you to play almost any Playstation game from PS2 to PS4. The difference being you can download most of these games and play them without constantly needing to download them as you play. This being said the streaming component runs the games as smoothly as a flip picture book with gum stuck between every third page, even on games from two generations ago. Not a good way to experience a game. 

Problem 6: They lie when they say you don’t need hardware. Instead of an Xbox, hardware designed for gaming; you will have to use your phone or computer (aka hardware). Phones are not good gaming consoles and there is no chance they can keep up with what’s needed to play a modern game let alone stream one from start to finish, so that’s out of the question.  That leaves us with gaming PC’s and good ones can cost up to $1000. A PS4 only costs $399.

                I could go on but I don’t see the point. What I could gather from watching the conference and reading interviews, is that Google wants to enter the Gaming market and for good reason, it’s a 21.5 billion dollar a year industry in the US alone. They think the best way to do this is to flip the industry on its head and do way with home consoles. The problem with this is people love their gaming consoles, and people love their physical media. They want to become the middle man between me and my video games and I want nothing to do with them.

How much would you pay for Google Stadia?



So Google Stadia is official, and Mountain View is ready to sell us on a dream: that of zero-latency, HQ game streaming available on tap for any device with a Chrome browser and seamlessly integrated into social media. It even works (ahem) under the demo conditions. What we don’t yet know is how much it costs. What we ask today, however, is how much should it cost?

For the purpose of argument, let’s assume that Google Stadia just works. Internet speed, latency and visual quality isn’t an issue. Is the product good enough to stand up on its own merits? Let’s also presume a Netflix-style subscription service (the most likely price model) rather than a Steam-like storefront. And thirdly in this rather generous scenario, Stadia is offering a wide library of games you actually want.

On the one hand, you would be able to immediately access a game you see on YouTube, play it, share it with your friends and seamless move it between devices, be it a smartphone, tablet, TV or potato laptop, without worrying about hardware investment. You could try out games early and find out if they’re good without committing $60 a pop to pre-orders or hundreds of dollars for next-gen hardware.

On the other hand, there are some glaring disadvantages to the model even if it works well. You don’t own the games yourself, they could be pulled by Google at any moment, and can’t be modded, played offline or saved for posterity. Not ideal, but if the price is right, it could well work for many.

Writing about how Stadia could compete in the gaming market, I guessed about $15-$20 for a subscription service to take on rivals like PlayStation Now, Xbox Game Pass, and Shadow. But Google might go even cheaper than that. After all, the company makes its money from our data by offering a suite of free online services like Google Photos, Gmail, Google Docs and so on. It’s Google Home range of smart speakers are very aggressively priced, and Mountain View may similar try to undercut the entrenched gaming giants as much as possible.

Are there any regular gamers ready to ditch their prized hardware? Anyone who’d like to game more but would prefer an on-demand streaming model to the traditional market? ",,azfreetrial,Singapore,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,How much would you pay for Google Stadia?https://techzooms.com/cell-phones/how-much-would-you-pay-for-google-stadia/,Post,,

It's 20 dollars, almost all of the good games are on ps3 (played them all), and the ps4 ones are ancient titles (again played). There's some good ps3 stuff though. Price of admission is insanely overpriced, it's alright if you abuse free trials. The annual sub price is 99$ which is a crazy good deal. I enjoy replaying games, so some of those older titles I would love to play and dont own anymore. I dont own many PS4 games at all. For my tastes its really amazing. I would spend more than 99$ in a year buying maybe 1 brand new game and maybe a few games on sale. Why do that when I can get a crap ton of games for what breaks down to even less than $10 a month 😱 Like i said, outside of collecting physical, I just cant see the issue here.

LOLIAmAnAlt posted... I've been pc/nintendo for a while now. Unfortunately you just can't get nintendo games on the pc. Well you can't get Sony games on PC either, its seems the only console manufacturer that actually puts out most of their games on PC is Microsoft. That is not true. Except for the latest games, many of Sony's older exclusives(including some from this gen) are available on PSNow which you can access on PC or via emulators. The Quantic games exclusives including Detroit Become Human are also about to be offered on the Epic website on PC. Eventually all the newer exclusives will also be made available on PSNow on PC. MS also owns the Windows OS platform on PC so basically they are offering their games on their own platform on PC and not just on Xbox One. They have been publishing PC games(MS Flight Simulator) long before even the Windows OS existed. Yeah Sony will offer their games on PC after they feel those specific games are no longer driving console sales which is pretty smart. I’m sure by the time PS5 comes out and they no longer care about selling PS4s they will put all the PS4 exclusives on PSNow. If you don’t mind waiting 4-5 years to play a game then there’s no point in buying consoles... I have thousands of games on steam. It will take a long time for me to get to the major games in my backlog much less the few games that Sony keeps exclusive. I can wait. There are plenty of multi-platforms(majority of games) to keep me busy, including hundreds of PC exclusives(from RTS to grand strategy to MOBA and flight simulator games) that are currently not available on consoles. Besides with the advent of live streaming, I think that Sony will eventually need to release their exclusives early. Otherwise they eventually will lose out on the billions of non console gamers on mobile, PC, smart phones, tablets, etc. that Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon are maneuvering to try gain a market share in. With the advent of streaming we don’t need gaming PCs anymore either since we will just be able to stream 4k60fps to out toasters anyway. Streaming is exactly what console companies want as they never made big profits from the hardware anyway. Also streaming will affect us PC gamers who enjoy the openness of this platform as streaming will take away any semblance of control from us.

7784f4a3-4193-437f-add1-435286491b00,3/22/2019,http://support.proboards.com/post/7178586/thread#,"A move to a disc-less console makes sense for Microsoft. The company has been aggressively pushing its Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service that provides access to more than 100 Xbox games. Xbox Game Studios titles like Sea of Thieves and Crackdown 3 launch first on the service, and Microsoft even recently added Minecraft to Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft is also working on an xCloud game streaming service that will stream games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices. Microsoft is using Xbox One S hardware in these servers, and a digital-only console would be another boost for such a service. As the last paragraph says, this particular console is promoting Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass. With the success other streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and so on, other video game companies are following suit with the GaaS (Games as a Service) model. This model revolves around creating games and services that promotes sustainable profits through in-game add-ons, rationing content, game streaming services, and monthly subscriptions. The disc-less Xbox is a step in that direction. Another thing to point out: With the rise of digital sales, physical copies will dwindle. Physical copies will affect certain aspects of the video game industry: Less physical copies means less chance for profits for Gamestop and other physical retailers that makes money off of selling pre-owned games. Friends cannot share digital copies of games which means more money for the publishers. Less overhead expenses for publishers as it cuts out the middleman and more control over prices. In my opinion, I always prefer to get a physical copy of a game unless the price difference is drastic when compared to the digital copy. Of course, it's really easy to play modern games when it comes to the current generation. If you want to play older generation games, however, is not as easy as buying a DVD of a movie and watching it on any DVD player. Streaming services will give players an opportunity to play games from the past with a monthly subscription as oppose to looking for a game and a console to play. Right now, I don't see video gaming streaming has matured as a market yet. Google Stadia was recently announced, Xbox has or is about to release Game Pass, and Playstation has Playstation Now. There aren't any reliable 3rd-party streaming services because licensing is a fickle thing. The first time I heard about video game streaming services was Onlive. I'm not sure if they're still around but they had issues with maintaining licenses from AAA games. for example, If you were in the middle of Batman: Arkham Asylum and the license to hold the game expired for the host, you can't progress your game anymore. Additionally, streaming does have it's own issues as well like split-second lags and pixelation. This wouldn't be an issue for casual or turn-based gaming but this won't bold well for the competitive scene like first-person shooters and fighting games.",,kelvin,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,Xbox One S All-Digital edition,,,

183558484914,3/19/2019,http://businessliveme.tumblr.com/post/183558484914,"This week, more than 25,000 members of the video game industry are scheduled to descend on San Francisco for the geeky, and often sleepy, annual gathering known as the Game Developers Conference.

This year, though, more people than usual are paying attention. Google is set to unveil a video game service, codenamed Project Stream, that will reportedly allow people to play Fortnite and other modern titles in a web browser or on a television using inexpensive hardware. If it’s successful, the system might herald the biggest shift in the $180 billion a year global gaming market since Super Mario jumped from arcades to the living room.

Google has been privately testing Project Stream since last fall and just touted its announcement planned for Tuesday with a video trailer. The service will deliver games on demand, rather than as downloads, and is expected to support even the most fast-twitch and graphic-rich games, without the need for a PlayStation, Xbox or other high-end game console. It’s unclear whether it will work with existing Google devices like Chromecast or Google Home, or whether it will require players to buy new hardware.

Nevertheless, the project is already being heralded as a portent of the industry’s future, where games are streamed over the internet and a new phalanx of heavyweights could dominate—not just Google but Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and maybe even telecoms. The major cloud providers control massive data centers, lightning-fast content delivery networks and other assets that allow them to reduce the lag associated with playing games over the internet. “Cloud gaming creates this moment in the industry where the multi-billion-dollar companies like Google and Amazon have a chance to buy their way in, in the same way they’ve done in video and music,” says Joost van Dreunen, a managing director at market research firm Nielsen.

Google isn’t the only company that sees an opportunity in creating a sort of Netflix for video games. Nvidia Corp., a chipmaker not known for its consumer products, was one of the first to sell a streaming-games console based on Google’s Android. Amazon, meanwhile, has been busy hiring gaming veterans like the man responsible for the Command & Conquer franchise.

The game industry’s current juggernauts are looking to fortify their positions from a possible shift to streaming. Sony Corp. has offered a subscription service for years called PlayStation Now. Electronic Arts Inc. acquired a streaming business last year and is building a platform called Project Atlas. Last week, Microsoft Corp. showed off a demo of something called Project xCloud, which will allow gamers to play cutting-edge games like online racer Forza Horizon 4 from just about any device with a screen and an internet connection.

Analysts suggest companies with technical expertise in cloud infrastructure will be better-equipped to compete. One lingering question is around business models. Will Google and its new rivals sell games individually or offer access to a large library via subscription, a la Netflix?

We’ll find out for sure on Tuesday, but Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter believes the major game publishers aren’t quite ready to sacrifice profit margins to try something new. Like movie studios, game makers will likely view subscription revenue as cannibalistic to their main business of selling games, he says. Publishers typically offer up older games or lower-profile releases through the current crop of streaming products. As the tepid response to those services show, gamers want access to the newest, hottest titles. “Everyone wants to be the Netflix of games, but I’m utterly confident it won’t work,” Pachter says.

However, he hastens to add that new cloud gaming services could expand the market, rather than steal share from existing options. “There are a couple billion people out there with internet access and only 250 million consoles,” Pachter says. “This could at least double the industry.”

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Is this in anticipation of FIFA points removal, so fut becomes monthly subscription with packs included ,just a idea with my tinfoil hat on. nah, fifa point still available in PC and XBOX although they have EA access.",,daydreamer45,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA Access could reportedly be on the way to PlayStation 4,,,

No reasons to own a console when you can just stream games. It needs to be significantly better than PSNow for it to have any chance of success, and it needs to have a large library of games. Google new ideas are very hit and miss, though they have a very large fanbase which will give them a nice start even if it is shit (see Tensorflow). Curious to see how this develops, and how especially MS, Sony and possibly Valve react. I guess it is gonna be a few companies who have a lot of exclusives, which mean that you need to subscribe in all of them if you want to access all great games. If it is cheap (like 10-15USD for month), it should be okay by doing so (the total will be like buying a new game every month which many gamers do anyway).

According to Bloomberg, Apple is creating a “premium games subscription” service for the App Store. Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft’s xCloud, Apple’s service is not cloud-based.

Instead, it will focus on iPhones and iPads and bundle together paid games from different developers that consumers can access for a monthly fee,“ Bloomberg reported.

One source said Apple will pay developers based on how much time users spend playing their title. The report goes on to claim that the service would only feature paid games, not free-to-play titles. The report also says the service may not be announced on Monday, but instead during its developer conference in June. That timing would be intriguing, as it’s just before E3.

According to analyst Serkan Toto, this kind of package offering is already available in Japan. He also points out that, if free-to-play games are indeed excluded, then Nintendo’s upcoming Mario Kart Tour wouldn’t be eligible. As you may recall, Apple partnered with Nintendo in a big way to promote and release the free-to-play Mario game Super Mario Run.

Problem is: if the article is to be believed, F2P content is excluded.
 For Mario Kart Tour, both Nintendo and DeNA confirmed (not only one time) it will not be a paid game.
 Let’s see.
 — Dr. Serkan Toto (Kantan Games Inc.) (@serkantoto) March 23, 2019 
Go to Bloomberg to get the full story.

An earlier report suggested the March 25 Apple news conference will include the formal reveal of Apple’s plans for its own Netflix-style TV streaming service. All should become clear soon.

183615741320,3/21/2019,http://zacks-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183615741320,"Alphabet’s GOOGL division Google announced gaming platform, Stadia, at 2019 Game Developers Conference (“GDC”), finally ending its quest for browser-based video game streaming service.

Notably, Stadia which will be launched later this year will enable users to stream games online on any devices like smartphones, laptops, desktops and tablets. Moreover, users can play games on televisions with the aid of Chromecast media stick connection.

All these will be achieved by leveraging Google’s robust cloud products and services, and strong datacenter network.

In fact, Google’s aim of becoming the “Netflix of the gaming industry” is likely to cause massive disruption to this space. Notably, the gaming space is currently valued at $140 billion. Further, the video game industry is expected to hit $180.1 billion by 2021, per a report by Newzoo.

Additionally, the gaming market generated revenues worth $136 billion in 2018, per an IDC report, which reflects that the figure is growing at a rate of 15% every year.

Moreover, the new cloud-based service will provide a tough competition to the existing players like Sony SNE and Nintendo NTDOY. Further, it will intensify competition for Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT which are also leaving no stone unturned to leverage their cloud capabilities to bolster presence in this booming industry.




 


Is Google a Threat to Sony, Nintendo & Others?

Google with its new service is likely to bolster gamers’ savings rate as they will not have to shell out money on expensive gaming consoles and PCs anymore to play graphic-intensive games.

Further, the company is utilizing its video streaming platform, YouTube, to ensure seamless game play. This will eliminate waiting time for downloading the game content. They will be able to play games as easily as they watch video on YouTube.

These gamer friendly features of the Stadia are expected to hurt established gaming stocks – Sony and Nintendo who offer access to play high-end games via their expensive gaming consoles. Per Bloomberg, shares of Sony as well as Nintendo plunged 4.5% and 4.6%, respectively, during the intraday trading following the announcement of Google Stadia.

Nintendo, the maker of Pokemon and Super Mario, offers offline as well as online games through its hybrid console called Switch that costs $299.99, which is pretty expensive. Nintendo currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Further, Sony, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has PlayStation Now, a cloud gaming subscription service, which offers streaming of a huge library of video games on PlayStation 4 (PS4) and gaming PCs. Notably, PS4 is as expensive as Switch.

Further, the news also impacted the shares of Electronic Arts EA which is a leading developer, marketer, publisher and distributor of interactive video game software and content. The stock plunged by 2.2% on Mar 19.

Additionally, Stadia streaming game service poses threat to the sale of Microsoft’s Xbox, a home video game console.

How Amazon & Microsoft are Placed in Cloud Gaming?

The adoption of cloud technology is becoming mainstream in the gaming industry as it has the capability of handling several challenging technical and graphical problems in streaming a high-end game.

Moreover, the interactive nature of video games requires the creation of detailed graphical images instantly on a real-time basis according to actions of a player. Further, latency is one of the biggest problems in streaming these games. Tech giants are taking advantage of these issues to strengthen footprint in the gaming industry by leveraging cloud services.

Apart from Google, Amazon and Microsoft are also taking advantage of these issues to strengthen their presence in the gaming industry with the aid of their robust cloud computing techniques.

Amazon which already offers video game streaming services via its Twitch platform is aggressively pursuing the development of a cloud gaming service which will help users play games while eliminating the need for download. Reportedly, this Zacks Rank #3 stock was recently on the lookout for engineers to work on its mission for cloud games.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is gearing up to launch trials of its project dubbed XCloud, a cloud streaming service for games. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 stock is planning to develop a streaming box that will offer streaming services for video games on Xbox consoles with the support of its cloud platform, Azure.

Nevertheless, Google’s strong efforts to capitalize on its cloud capabilities in order to make Stadia user friendly, are likely to strengthen its gaming position. The company is utilizing Advanced Micro Devices’ AMD customized Radeon datacenter GPU for new service.

Further, AMD’s software tools will be utilized in the Linux and open-source Vulkan API based Stadia platform. This will assist software developers to provide immersive game streaming experience to the end user.

Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3.

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » I haven't tried a game streaming service, so I'm kind of curious about the latency and speed of light issues that people were talking about. Is it something that makes tons of games simply unplayable for anyone who's ever gone into a settings menu, or does the latency just mean that you maybe don't get a good experience with the twitchiest games, like competitive shooters and fighting games? Armchair seemed to suggest that this would mostly only be useful for turn based games, but people indicated they were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey well enough, and it seems like PSNow has been doing it since 2014. Are streamed games just garbage to play over PSNow, or is it not as bad as all that? I played AC:O on Stream and it worked really well. I was using 100mbps wired Fios. I went in there specifically to test the latency and I'd say it matched my expectations of what a best-case scenario looks like for the tech. i.e. if you watch the screen closely as you press a button on the controller you'll definitely see it, and it's not my preference to sacrifice any input latency, but I could easily play the game that way and get used to it. A lamen player who isn't technical enough to be looking for latency probably would not notice it. That's on a controller though, using mouselook I really didn't like it. Even a casual player might notice the difference there compared to moving a mouse cursor on their computer. As I said before, KBAM is just objectively more precise than controllers can be. It's not a value judgement or a preference call when I say ""objectively more precise."" Think directional movements. With a keyboard, it's all or nothing. On or off. Controllers have far more granularity in left stick control than WASD, and it's there that you can get away with slightly slower control response because people just don't switch finger positions, they're moving a stick over a plane which can take time. Right stick controls are way less precise than a mouse. A mouse has a huge surface area it can move and nearly infinite different speeds, utilizing your entire arm for the movement, whereas sticks are just kind of a general thing that makes use of acceleration. Combine the two and input lag is fundamentally going to be more noticeable. Sure, I do agree that KB+M is incompatible with streaming except for the most casual of players. It would work okay for cursor-driven games with a client-rendered cursor, like RTSes, but that's about it. That said, KB+M is a dying breed - the only players who prefer that over a controller are the ones buying gaming PCs. So that doesn't worry me for the success of these services.",,Zek,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,[Google Stadia] Stream all your games anywhere! - Page 16,,,

Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Is this in anticipation of FIFA points removal, so fut becomes monthly subscription with packs included ,just a idea with my tinfoil hat on.",,Smithy78,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA Access could reportedly be on the way to PlayStation 4,,,

I recently just found this website, and I have to say, it is amazing. I have been playing the PlayStation ever since I was 4 when I got a PS2, and have been a hardcore gamer ever since. One thing I really love about PlayStation now is earning trophies. Earning trophies make me feel really awesome about myself and I get respect from people both in real life and on the Internet when I tell of my accomplishments. This website's leaderboards is a great way to also compare myself against players like me everywhere, and I also love how cheaters are easily removed. However, there is a problem. Years ago, on Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, I unfortunately ran into a hacker. I was in a random lobby on the TranZit zombies map trying to find people to complete the Tower of Babble trophy, which required you to complete the easter egg/quest for the map. While my friend and I were in the cornfield trying to do the steps, we started having random trophies appear on our screen, which we figured were just a few glitches because I recognized them as campaign trophies. I soon realized what was happening the second I earned a trophy for the zombies map Mob of the Dead, which was a DLC map that I did not own at that time. By the time I realized what was happening, the damage was already done to me and my friend. Even after the game ended, we were still being awarded trophies for absolutely no reason. It did stop eventually, and when it did it left me a few trophies to earn in the campaign that I could still earn legitimately. Black Ops 2 is my rarest platinum, but because I know I unintentionally was hacked into making the platinum easier I did not include it in my trophy cabinet. I am an honest person when it comes to things like this and I would like to know how I can not be flagged as illegitimate because of events I had no control of. Is there any way that I can talk to the owner of the site or someone who helps out with maintaining the cheating system? I'm worried someone will see the dates for the hacked trophies and make the assumption that I am a cheater, which is not the case. I appreciate everyone that reads this long post and gives me helpful advice or even helps me solve the problem that I am currently facing.",,PatinumNumemon,United States of America,,,Positive,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,I need help staying legitimate on the leaderboards!,,,

It crashed and burned because of lag, basically. Playstation Now has existed for 5 years at this point but - given that a lot of the coverage is treating this announcement as some kind of technical breakthrough - doesn't seem to have exactly taken the market by storm. IIRC there are a couple of European ISPs that already offer a similar service. You can stream Arkham City with Telecom Italia: https://www.tim.it/smart-life/tv-entertainment/timgames So the question of how viable it is technically should at least be answerable by looking at how good all the competing services already are. Oh, I distinctly remember trying to play LA Noire over OnLive and.. hooboy was that bad. I'm not saying things are going to be different this time around but I do think if anyone could provide enough horsepower and make it marketable enough to make this even remotely successful it would probably be Google?

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade.""

The only new features google brings is integration with youtube and perhaps other digital services. The biggest enhancements should be better video compression and ideally much lower latency. Are consumers finally ready to accept cloud based gaming? Due to the popularity of psnow im going to assume no, but it will eventually happen. No question about it that the world is going digital, however, game streaming is the lamborghini of streaming services due to its need of a realiable high speed connection and the hardware to maintain it.

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade."" Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft's xCloud, Apple's service is not cloud-based.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.

Why the Future of Gaming Might Mean the End of Consoles





This article comes from Den of Geek UK. 

Just over a month ago, Sony’s PlayStation boss Shawn Layden suggested that the future of gaming could be “kind of a post-console world where you can have quality gaming experiences across a variety of technologies.” 

“Sure, PS4 and PS4 Pro provide what, of course, we think is the best gaming experience,” he added, “but the other consoles out there, be it [Nintendo] Switch, Xbox One X, or tablets, or phones – there are great experiences across all these. What we need to do is recognize all that. We’re not little gaming ghettos that are not federated or aligned at all. We’re all part of the same gaming community, we just come at it through different doorways. I think the future will be an extension of that metaphor. Your platform is not your hideaway. It’s just your doorway to all these other gamer folk.” 

In the month since Layden made that statement, a lot of evidence has emerged that seems to back up his claims that the lines might be blurring between PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox. Let’s have a look at the clues, then, and ponder what this post-console world could look like for the gamers and companies involved… 

More sharing between companies



Game companies are becoming more open to sharing their content than they were in the past. Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s Xbox boss, has provided a perfect example of this sharing-friendly new way of thinking. 

“We want to bring [Xbox] Game Pass to any device that somebody wants to play on,” Spencer told Geekwire in an interview, referring to the streaming service where gamers can pay a monthly fee to access an impressive library of Xbox 360 and Xbox One games. 

The service was originally only available on Xbox One, but rumors suggest that it could soon launch on Nintendo Switch. If Spencer really wants the service to appear on “any device that somebody wants to play on,” it seems safe to assume that the possibility of bringing the service to PlayStation consoles, mobile devices, and PC has at least been discussed at Microsoft. In fact, through the Play Anywhere initiative, there are already a select number of Xbox Game Pass games that you can play on Windows 10 PCs. 

Microsoft has also revealed that Xbox Live support is coming to mobile devices and there are rumors that the service might also appear on the Nintendo Switch, giving players access to achievements, their friends list, and Gamerscore on devices beyond the Xbox One. Developers will also be able to implement Xbox Live support into their games.  

The company has also just launched an update to its Wireless Display app that allows users to stream their PCs through an Xbox One. While this isn’t exactly a partnership between Xbox and PC platforms like Steam, this update has opened the door to streaming Steam games on Xbox One. What is a surprising partnership is Microsoft putting the PC port of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam. That’s a major step for Microsoft, which is hoping its flagship franchise to PC for the first time in more than a decade.  

Meanwhile, Sony’s own streaming service – PlayStation Now – already allows users to stream a library of PS2, PS3, and PS4 games on PC. The boundaries between the games you own and where you can play them seem to be gradually crumbling in a way that would have been difficult to imagine a few years ago. 

The end of the exclusive?



Although you do still see games companies producing exclusive titles (see: Marvel’s Spider-Man, God of War, Crackdown 3, Pokémon Sword and Shield), real progress has been made by Nintendo and Microsoft to bring their first-party titles to other platforms. While the latter company’s cross-platform endeavors have mostly entailed bringing its Xbox exclusives to Windows, another one of its platforms, the Japanese game publisher has truly made the leap. 

The Big N has already brought Pokemon, Super Mario, Fire Emblem, and Animal Crossing to mobile devices, and a new Mario Kart mobile game is also on the way. Bringing Nintendo properties to mobile in new and interesting ways (see: Pokemon Go) has opened new doors for the company, as it attempts to reach a whole new casual audience. 

Going forward, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched to imagine a world where exclusive games don’t stay exclusive forever and a time when a vast amount of older titles will be made available on devices that they didn’t originally launch on.  



Streaming games instead of sitting down with your console



Streaming, it seems, is the next great frontier for games companies. Whether you’re logging into PlayStation Now or Xbox Game Pass on a non-console device, playing PC games through your Xbox One, or remotely controlling your console from your phone (which is also something you can do right now in a lot of cases), the magic of the internet and online streaming is allowing games to bridge to gap between the systems they were made for and the ones that people currently have on hand. 

At the moment, there are limits on the sort of game that you can stream without encountering massive lag or breaking the internet. Older titles and smaller titles can work really well when streamed, but massive AAA games don’t always translate through the internet in the same way. But you can be sure that brainboxes are working behind the scenes to remedy that.  

Microsoft is working on an ominous-sounding initiative entitled Project xCloud, for example, which has the aim of creating a cloud-based streaming platform that can process huge games such as Halo without the need for a physical console in the room. Nobody seems to mind that hefty home consoles could go the way of the dodo as a result. 

“That is not where you make money,” Microsoft’s Phil Spencer said, on the topic of console sales, in that same Geekwire interview. “The business inside of games is really selling games […] So if you open it up, the more often people can play, the more they’re enjoying the art form. It increases the size of the business.” 

If the nut of lag-free streaming for major new games can be cracked, we could hypothetically live in a world where you don’t need to be anywhere near a console (or perhaps you won’t even need to own one at all) in order to play a new title. If your internet connection was strong enough, you could just log into your games membership thingy on whatever device you have handy and start playing from where you left off. 

Of course, there will always be situations when you’d rather play a game offline, so here’s hoping that the rise of game streaming doesn’t make the ability to download games a thing of the past. We can definitely see the physical disc going that way, though. 

Gaming on the go



In the same way that having Netflix on numerous devices has revolutionized the way we watch TV – allowing us to dip in and out of a binge whenever we get a spare minute – the possibility of fully functional AAA streaming and a greater amount of content-sharing between companies could mean that the way we play games majorly evolves in the next few years. 

Imagine a world where you can play the same game on your home TV, your phone, your laptop, or your tablet. As long as you have a strong enough internet connection, you could hypothetically stream that game anywhere. The flexibility of the Nintendo Switch – which allows you to play at home or on the god – could one day apply to all gaming.  

Many companies seem to be interested in game streaming and content sharing, both of which suggest a world where you don’t need to be with your home console in order to play home-console-sized games. This will be music to the ears of people who struggle to find the hours to play at home but would love to fire up an exciting new title when they’re away. Also, if the boundaries properly come down between devices and companies, gaming could start to seem like a less complicated pastime for newcomers to get involved with. 

What’s interesting, though, is that Sony and Microsoft are both developing next-generation consoles, despite all their interest in these new frontiers. It’ll be interesting to see how the PS5 and the Xbox Two (or whatever they end up being called) factor into these big ideas about how gaming can evolve… Are these next consoles the last ones we’ll ever have to buy? We’ll just have to wait and see to find out, but it is an interesting future to imagine.",,champagne-stress,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Why the Future of Gaming Might Mean the End of Consoles,Post,,

The most disruptive part in here is the lack of hardware, you just need a PC, a TV ready, or a smartphone. The only hardware showed was a Google's game controller. Do you think this could mean something for the home console market? What does it mean for Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo?

But generally every gen there's always some advantage from the start for one of the two: The Xbox may have nabbed a couple npd wins from the PS2 but was shredded in general due to a one year head start and as a consequence, library advantage. The PS3 reveal was so poor along with insulting their own fans the 360 was able to gain foothold in many places. The Xbox One drm policies may have been reversed, but the console strategy was still the same and couldn't be reversed at the last second. Launching only in 13 countries for nearly a year, Kinect included by force, and costing $100 more. But this time it seems like the PlatStation and Xbox will be on even footing with Xbox A and PS5. Both companies had their biggest ""what the heck are you doing"" moments in their console history. Xbox has been rebuilding their first party which collapsed in 2012, and has several cool services like gamepass and a new hardware team. PlayStation has their studios working on the new console ahead of time, making sure games will be at launch, and cool features with VR and PSNOW. So outside a major screw up at either reveal, this seems to me to be the first time both Xbox and PlayStation will compete on equal footing from the start.

Click to expand... I'm a bit of a framerate and latency obsessive, so any form of streaming is likely to get a thumbs-down from me. We should really be working to reduce latency and try to get back to where we were in the arcade/CRT days (<=16ms from input to screen response). Today there's all too often 100ms or so between input and screen response even without streaming being involved, which is really quite poor. But the reality is that many players are now used to fairly-high-latency 30fps gaming on consoles, and even where the developers try their best to run at 60fps with minimal software-induced latency, you can have LCD TVs adding 60-100ms of latency (especially those that aren't in Game Mode). So if you've got a particularly laggy TV, you really won't want to add streaming lag on top. But if you've got a low-latency TV/monitor, a good streaming experience probably won't feel any worse than you'd get now from a console connected to a laggy TV. You'll certainly notice it if you're a fighting game/platformer/shmup enthusiast, though... ====================::==================== angrypenguin said: ↑ Have they announced their consumer pricing model? Click to expand... They haven't, but here's the thing(s): PSNow? Relatively expensive consumer model, terrible returns for developers. Netflix? Relatively cheap consumer model, terrible returns for content producers. Allegedly marginally better if it's original content (true original, not ""we licensed this for distribution from another country"" original) Youtube? Free entry for consumer model, returns are so bad that content producers are starting to near universally rely on services like D.rip and Patreon just to keep producing content. But that's not even the half of it. Google's use of algorithms and general business practices have been a nightmare for a lot of content creators. Remember when it used to be possible to sustain yourself as an animator on YouTube before the big algorithm change back in 2014? I do. I remember a lot of algorithmic changes that left nothing but destruction in their wake for small to mid-sized creators. Google has shown time and time again that their concern begins and ends at benefiting their own bottom line, even if that means throwing small to mid-sized creators under the bus. So aside from this being a technological impossibility for an actually relatively small percentage of people like coastal Americans, it's also a worrying trend for independent creators.",,Murgilod,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Google Teaser? #Stadia | Page 2,,,

They have servers in a lot of places but Google blows them away as far as distance to nodes to lower latency. Microsoft has the library but Google has the buying power and resources to get tons of stuff under their umbrella. Microsoft is planning to launch a cheap console for this (allegedly) or you could use a Windows device, but Stadia needs any electronic device that can run Chrome, or their controller if you buy it and possibly a chromecast to get to no chrome decices. Microsoft has streaming integration into their service nobody uses, Google has YouTube integration. I just see this being dominated by Google in a few years, with hardcore gamers subscribing to Xbox Stream or PSNow for the library.

Free entry for consumer model, returns are so bad that content producers are starting to near universally rely on services like D.rip and Patreon just to keep producing content. But that's not even the half of it. Google's use of algorithms and general business practices have been a nightmare for a lot of content creators. Remember when it used to be possible to sustain yourself as an animator on YouTube before the big algorithm change back in 2014? I do. I remember a lot of algorithmic changes that left nothing but destruction in their wake for small to mid-sized creators. Google has shown time and time again that their concern begins and ends at benefiting their own bottom line, even if that means throwing small to mid-sized creators under the bus.

There are different expectations with console-only games as they drive sales of said console and those subscriptions. For example, in this case Naughty Dog is owned by Sony, so whether they make a profit on the game itself or not, they're gonna profit in other ways. Uncharted 4 for example was PS4's 3rd bestselling game ever, but even that is just 8.7M units. Did it turn a profit? Sure, but not a huge one on the game itself. God of War for all it's accolades sold just 5M copies. Did it turn a profit after development and marketing costs? Probably not. Maybe it broke even. But again, you can get away with those numbers on a console-only game as they make up for that in PS4 sales, PSPlus & PSNow subscriptions. So in the case of companies like EA (who are multiplatform), their profits are tied to the game itself.

This could be the logo for Google’s new streaming video game service





Google’s new not-officially-announced streaming service logo.


 James Martin/CNET


Forget reading tea leaves, let’s squint at a sign.

Google showed off a massive squiggle above a space it constructed at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Monday. Though the company didn’t respond to a request for comment about whether the big purplish “s” is indeed a logo (perhaps for the word “streaming”?) Variety says an employee confirmed it to be so. 

Regardless of what logo Google uses, the company’s expected to officially announce its Project Stream service at a GDC press event Tuesday. The service will allow people to play video games over the internet in much the same way they can watch movies from Netflix now.

Google isn’t the only company offering this type of service. Sony has offered game streaming through its PlayStation Now service since 2014, for example. Microsoft and Electronic Arts meanwhile have said they’re working on their own takes as well. 

CNET will be at Google’s big reveal Tuesday, covering it live. You can watch a stream here.

I don't think this magic game streaming audience who exists but can't afford ps4 is real. I think it is the same pipe dream of casual gamers consoles have been chasing since the Wii. Audience is fickle and doesn't stick around long in the past. Never forget the Kinect. I think this magical audience of money strapped casuals can be appealed to much easier on a cell phone, and they may not be the type to set down in front of a TV and play a console for a decade. That would make them hardcore gamers who would in turn hate game streaming. Part of the play with these types of services is getting these games on phones and tablets. It it gets reliable enough and is available on something like the switch, you'll get customers. The current gaming footprint is not all the gamers that could potentially use a service like this. - - - Updated - - - Originally Posted by Planetdune I like my €3000 desktop and have been using PC's since the 386 days... no way I would just want to stream games on some dataserver..

Why the Future of Gaming Might Mean the End of Consoles





This article comes from Den of Geek UK. 

Just over a month ago, Sony’s PlayStation boss Shawn Layden suggested that the future of gaming could be “kind of a post-console world where you can have quality gaming experiences across a variety of technologies.” 

“Sure, PS4 and PS4 Pro provide what, of course, we think is the best gaming experience,” he added, “but the other consoles out there, be it [Nintendo] Switch, Xbox One X, or tablets, or phones – there are great experiences across all these. What we need to do is recognize all that. We’re not little gaming ghettos that are not federated or aligned at all. We’re all part of the same gaming community, we just come at it through different doorways. I think the future will be an extension of that metaphor. Your platform is not your hideaway. It’s just your doorway to all these other gamer folk.” 

In the month since Layden made that statement, a lot of evidence has emerged that seems to back up his claims that the lines might be blurring between PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox. Let’s have a look at the clues, then, and ponder what this post-console world could look like for the gamers and companies involved… 

More sharing between companies



Game companies are becoming more open to sharing their content than they were in the past. Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s Xbox boss, has provided a perfect example of this sharing-friendly new way of thinking. 

“We want to bring [Xbox] Game Pass to any device that somebody wants to play on,” Spencer told Geekwire in an interview, referring to the streaming service where gamers can pay a monthly fee to access an impressive library of Xbox 360 and Xbox One games. 

The service was originally only available on Xbox One, but rumors suggest that it could soon launch on Nintendo Switch. If Spencer really wants the service to appear on “any device that somebody wants to play on,” it seems safe to assume that the possibility of bringing the service to PlayStation consoles, mobile devices, and PC has at least been discussed at Microsoft. In fact, through the Play Anywhere initiative, there are already a select number of Xbox Game Pass games that you can play on Windows 10 PCs. 

Microsoft has also revealed that Xbox Live support is coming to mobile devices and there are rumors that the service might also appear on the Nintendo Switch, giving players access to achievements, their friends list, and Gamerscore on devices beyond the Xbox One. Developers will also be able to implement Xbox Live support into their games.  

The company has also just launched an update to its Wireless Display app that allows users to stream their PCs through an Xbox One. While this isn’t exactly a partnership between Xbox and PC platforms like Steam, this update has opened the door to streaming Steam games on Xbox One. What is a surprising partnership is Microsoft putting the PC port of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam. That’s a major step for Microsoft, which is hoping its flagship franchise to PC for the first time in more than a decade.  

Meanwhile, Sony’s own streaming service – PlayStation Now – already allows users to stream a library of PS2, PS3, and PS4 games on PC. The boundaries between the games you own and where you can play them seem to be gradually crumbling in a way that would have been difficult to imagine a few years ago. 

The end of the exclusive?



Although you do still see games companies producing exclusive titles (see: Marvel’s Spider-Man, God of War, Crackdown 3, Pokémon Sword and Shield), real progress has been made by Nintendo and Microsoft to bring their first-party titles to other platforms. While the latter company’s cross-platform endeavors have mostly entailed bringing its Xbox exclusives to Windows, another one of its platforms, the Japanese game publisher has truly made the leap. 

The Big N has already brought Pokemon, Super Mario, Fire Emblem, and Animal Crossing to mobile devices, and a new Mario Kart mobile game is also on the way. Bringing Nintendo properties to mobile in new and interesting ways (see: Pokemon Go) has opened new doors for the company, as it attempts to reach a whole new casual audience. 

Going forward, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched to imagine a world where exclusive games don’t stay exclusive forever and a time when a vast amount of older titles will be made available on devices that they didn’t originally launch on.  



Streaming games instead of sitting down with your console



Streaming, it seems, is the next great frontier for games companies. Whether you’re logging into PlayStation Now or Xbox Game Pass on a non-console device, playing PC games through your Xbox One, or remotely controlling your console from your phone (which is also something you can do right now in a lot of cases), the magic of the internet and online streaming is allowing games to bridge to gap between the systems they were made for and the ones that people currently have on hand. 

At the moment, there are limits on the sort of game that you can stream without encountering massive lag or breaking the internet. Older titles and smaller titles can work really well when streamed, but massive AAA games don’t always translate through the internet in the same way. But you can be sure that brainboxes are working behind the scenes to remedy that.  

Microsoft is working on an ominous-sounding initiative entitled Project xCloud, for example, which has the aim of creating a cloud-based streaming platform that can process huge games such as Halo without the need for a physical console in the room. Nobody seems to mind that hefty home consoles could go the way of the dodo as a result. 

“That is not where you make money,” Microsoft’s Phil Spencer said, on the topic of console sales, in that same Geekwire interview. “The business inside of games is really selling games […] So if you open it up, the more often people can play, the more they’re enjoying the art form. It increases the size of the business.” 

If the nut of lag-free streaming for major new games can be cracked, we could hypothetically live in a world where you don’t need to be anywhere near a console (or perhaps you won’t even need to own one at all) in order to play a new title. If your internet connection was strong enough, you could just log into your games membership thingy on whatever device you have handy and start playing from where you left off. 

Of course, there will always be situations when you’d rather play a game offline, so here’s hoping that the rise of game streaming doesn’t make the ability to download games a thing of the past. We can definitely see the physical disc going that way, though. 

Gaming on the go



In the same way that having Netflix on numerous devices has revolutionized the way we watch TV – allowing us to dip in and out of a binge whenever we get a spare minute – the possibility of fully functional AAA streaming and a greater amount of content-sharing between companies could mean that the way we play games majorly evolves in the next few years. 

Imagine a world where you can play the same game on your home TV, your phone, your laptop, or your tablet. As long as you have a strong enough internet connection, you could hypothetically stream that game anywhere. The flexibility of the Nintendo Switch – which allows you to play at home or on the god – could one day apply to all gaming.  

Many companies seem to be interested in game streaming and content sharing, both of which suggest a world where you don’t need to be with your home console in order to play home-console-sized games. This will be music to the ears of people who struggle to find the hours to play at home but would love to fire up an exciting new title when they’re away. Also, if the boundaries properly come down between devices and companies, gaming could start to seem like a less complicated pastime for newcomers to get involved with. 

What’s interesting, though, is that Sony and Microsoft are both developing next-generation consoles, despite all their interest in these new frontiers. It’ll be interesting to see how the PS5 and the Xbox Two (or whatever they end up being called) factor into these big ideas about how gaming can evolve… Are these next consoles the last ones we’ll ever have to buy? We’ll just have to wait and see to find out, but it is an interesting future to imagine.",,shemo,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Why the Future of Gaming Might Mean the End of Consoles,Post,,

Youtube TV is old school TV for people that don't want to pay for a cable box(It's like $45 for the cheapest package). Those are more reinventions of old things(or in Postmates case capitalizing on human laziness) I don't know how comparable games will be to movies and music. Dvds/CD's are a $10 product. I think it's going to be a lot harder to sell people on non ownership of a $60($70 by the time it takes off?) product and still stay profitable. I know gamepass in the very least is attempting to cast a wide net to do something a lot closer to Netflix. I just don't know if Microsoft is going to be the one to pull streaming/subscription thing off. MS(despite MCC PC hype!) has a VERY bad reputation among PC gamers. Not to mention they are splitting that pie with everyone that will try the same thing(if Steam starts a service it will wipe the floor with MS.) Keep in mind some of the things you listed are market leaders(Netflix, Lyft, Apple) and others are fighting for a piece of the pie(Gamepass, YT TV, you can add Hulu etc.) MS already has a game shortage problem over PC/Sony. By no means are they short on games but they have hundreds less games than PC/PS4 with that gap growing week by week. Devs just do not find it profitable to dev everything to X1. They are fighting an uphill battle particularly against PC(google) which has thousands more games than X1 taking into account backwards compatibility. MS isn't really doing anything to rectify this and losing hardware sales isn't going to help thin that gap. I honestly don't know what MS is doing to close that gap, unless they just stream PC games without XBL functionality. If PSnow gets in the mix MS has a lot to worry about. > upgrade as frequently. Tell that to the phone industry. >The money is in PC and mobile gaming. In a way it is. PS4 is still the #1 dollar for dollar leader in the games industry followed by Switch. PC gaming has 95% of it's money in Steam. Mobile has %99 of it's money in addicting microtransacion garbage. Sony gets just as many games as PC but keeps it accessible and easy to put on your big screen TV. In the end I think MS is pivoting towards MASSIVE gambles that could bury MS as a gaming company.

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade."" Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft's xCloud, Apple's service is not cloud-based.

Need to play this again, I used to rent it back in the day for N64. I could get it for Playstation now though. Dunno which version is actually superior (I would imagine N64 has better graphics but a friend said something about the music was different?)

The n64 version had an extra Titanic Level. The jumping controls and how slippery the inside of the Titanic level was, made it so frustrating to play now.",,duwango,Brazil,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

It's no secret that there are other companies interested in game streaming: Amazon is expected to throw its hat into the ring along with Sony, which is actually already running a game streaming service in the form of PlayStation Now. But right now the company I'm most interested in hearing from is Microsoft, which is expected to reveal its Project xCloud at E3. For one thing, Microsoft has the muscle. It's not as big as market leader Amazon, but it's a cloud services provider with the sort of data infrastructure you need to pull off a scheme like this with the kind of latency you need to make it work. This is where it gains a big advantage over Sony, a company with no shortage of video game chops but with less of a presence in the cloud services industry. But where Microsoft pulls away from the rest of its competition is its relationship with the gaming industry, something it's been fighting hard for since 2001. It finds itself in a unique position right now: it entered this generation with a disastrous thud, alienating its core market with both an odd focus on the Xbox One as a television/motion control machine as well as a bunch of unpopular moves regarding used games and always-online requirements. It walked back most of the worst of it, but it didn't help the Xbox One much, particularly when it launched $100 more expensive than the PS4. Since Phil Spencer took over, however, it's been repairing its relationship with the gaming community at an admirable clip, launching fan-favorite features like backwards compatibility alongside a push for cross-play and the Game Pass subscription service. It still doesn't compete with Sony on exclusive software--though some recent studio acquisitions suggest it wants to--but the console, its services and its reputation with core gamers are in a good spot. Microsoft even has an increasingly friendly relationship with Nintendo, and the Nintendo Switch could well prove one of the best portable game streaming devices out there. The company has even run experiments with it in Japan, but it seems unlikely that Nintendo would run its own streaming service. Microsoft could be an interesting ally there. As Microsoft has learned time and time again, the gaming industry is just a tough spot, whether you're talking about wrangling the needs of developers in every country on Earth or dealing with what one might call ""passionate"" fans. And this is the game industry that Google wants to be a part of--if your big selling point is the ability to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Doom Eternal, you're clearly going to be selling primarily to people who currently play a lot of games and likely already own a console. It's a tough room, but it's a room that Microsoft knows well at this point. Google Stadia is likely to run into problems as it rolls this service out in 2019, whether that's baseline technical implementation, developer relations, fan expectations, pricing models or something else. Amazon, Sony and Microsoft will run into those same problems, but I'd argue that Microsoft is in the best situation to answer the widest range of those questions. https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/03/25/when-it-comes-to-game-streaming-id-bet-on-microsoft-and-xbox-over-google-stadia/#759141193eda I can't get on board with streaming, but I suspect there are some there that would like to venture out and try it.

No reasons to own a console when you can just stream games. It needs to be significantly better than PSNow for it to have any chance of success, and it needs to have a large library of games. Google new ideas are very hit and miss, though they have a very large fanbase which will give them a nice start even if it is shit (see Tensorflow). Curious to see how this develops, and how especially MS, Sony and possibly Valve react. I guess it is gonna be a few companies who have a lot of exclusives, which mean that you need to subscribe in all of them if you want to access all great games.

Most gaming writers seem to have no understanding of how world events and trends can affect the game industry.

In the last week, two of the world’s tech giants have made a big play for the attention – and wallets – of the world’s two billion gamers. Apple, already a big player in the video game market thanks to the iPhone and App Store, announced Apple Arcade, a subscription that will offer exclusive high-end games to be played on Macs, iPhones and iPads. And Google, a newcomer to video games, announced the subscription service Stadia, which will let players stream games to any screen from the cloud.

These moves towards a Netflix-style subscription approach present slightly different visions of how video games will be made and played. Google and Apple’s services will join Microsoft’s Xbox Games Pass and Sony’s PlayStation Now. Which company will dominate? And will these subscriptions complement the gaming industry’s current business model or eventually replace it?

First Look at Google Stadia - New Video Game Technology News



First Look at Google Stadia – New Video Game Technology News

Google Stadia is a new cloud gaming subscription service operated by multinational technology company Google. It is capable of streaming video games in 4K resolution at 60 frames per second, with support for high-dynamic-range, to players via the company’s numerous data centers across the globe. It will be accessible through the company’s Google Chrome web browser. Google Stadia integration with YouTube, and its “state share” feature which allows viewers of a Stadia stream to launch a game on the service on the same save state as the streamer, has been used as a selling point for the service. It is compatible with HID class USB controllers, though a proprietary controller manufactured by Google Stadia with a direct Wi-Fi link to data centers will be made available alongside the service. Known in development as Project Stream, the service was debuted through a closed beta running Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in October 2018, with a public release planned in late 2019. It is the direct competitor to Sony Interactive Entertainment’s PlayStation Now service, and Microsoft’s Project xCloud.



Google Stadia is a subscription-based cloud gaming service, and requires no additional computer hardware, only requiring the device to have an Internet connection and support for Google Chrome. Google Stadia works atop YouTube’s functionality in streaming media to the user, as game streaming is seen as an extension of watching video game live streams, according to Google’s Phil Harrison; the name “Stadia”, plural of “stadium”, is meant to reflect that it will be a collection of entertainment, of which the viewer can choose to sit back and watch, or take an active part in.

As Google had built out a large number of data centers across the globe, the company believes that Google Stadia is in a better position for cloud gaming compared to past endevours like OnLive, PlayStation Now, and Gaikai, as most players would be geographically close to a data center. Stadia supports the streaming of games in HDR at 60 frames per second with 4K resolution, and anticipates eventually reaching 120 frames per second at 8K resolution. Once subscribed to the service, players can start games without having to download new content to their personal device. Players can opt to record or stream their sessions onto YouTube through Stadia.

Viewers of such streams, subscribed to the service, can launch the games directly from the stream with the same save state that they were just watching.While Stadia can use any HID-class USB controller, Google developed its own controller which connects via Wi-Fi directly to the Google datacenter in which the game is running, to reduce input latency. During its GDC 2019 keynote reveal, Google confirmed that the controller would also feature Google Assistant, which will automatically search YouTube for relevant, helpful videos related to the game they are currently playing at the touch of a key.(source wiki)

Now this is completely unbiased, I own both the Pro and the X, and have had both consoles for each generation, so I have no bias. To cut things short, I'd say Xbox or wait until E3. Sony does have some great games, no doubt. For me personally though, they're more of ""one and done"" type games if you will. I'll beat God of War or Spiderman once, but I'll keep coming back to things like Halo and Gears. So for me, I prefer the games on Xbox more, they have more value to me and I love them. Now, if you're really into those games, then go with the PS4 no doubt. But for me personally, dropping 400 on a console to play a couple games once and lose out on features that Xbox offers is a no no. Additionally, I'm sure you've heard but Xbox bought tons of studios last year that are making games for the Xbox. On top of that, Microsoft just bought this massive block of land in the city for E3. Xbox is probably about to seriously pop off guns blazing this E3 (thanks Phil). Also, I'm sure you've heard but Xbox has gamepass now, a great service that is quite literally a steal. I'd look into it more as it drastically cuts down the cost of ownership. This next doesn't matter that much, but Xbox now gives out more games for free than Playstation now every month. Minor, but something to consider if you're on a tight budget. Lastly I wanted to discuss the quality of both systems. Xbox is way higher quality than the PS4, hence the 500 dollar price tag (on sale for 390 right now). By that, I mean hardware. My PS4 Pro sounds like a jet engine while I'm playing games, whereas the Xbox is dead silent. Now, different people have different experiences with noise as it seems to be hit or miss but generally the newer ones are better with noise. All in all, literally the ONLY reason that you should get a PS4 Pro is if you're a die hard God of War fan, or Spiderman. Whatever one.

I'm guessing the PS5 will either keep the touch pad or have compatibility with the dualshock 4 if they want the full backwards-compatibility (apparently the touch-specific actions in Infamous for example can't be re-adapted to button inputs). ​ What sucks is that the dualshock 3, the only controller (along with the dualshock 2) to have the pressure buttons, isn't officially compatible with the PS4 but it is officially supported by PSNow on PC. And I wouldn't be surprised if many third party PS3 controllers don't have the pressure-sensitive buttons (I hope I'm wrong though, I just can't find the info unlike sixaxis support).

183702184415,3/25/2019,http://mobidemia.tumblr.com/post/183702184415,"At this year’s Game Developer Conference in San Francisco last week, Google finally pulled the curtain back on one of the worst kept secrets in gaming: Google Stadia, its games streaming service. This article does a capable job of explaining what the Stadia is, but in a nutshell: Stadia is a cloud-based games streaming service that allows players to interact with video games instantly, without downloading anything, on their tablets, laptops, televisions, and mobile phones so long as their internet connection is sufficiently fast. Some specific hardware requirements, such as the fact that Stadia will not work on non-Pixel Android phones at launch, have dampened the lofty aspirations of the service, though.

Stadia isn’t the first ambitious cloud-based games streaming service to come to market: OnLive somewhat infamously was sold for less than $5MM after raising more than $50MM in financing and reaching a peak valuation of nearly $2BN. Gaikai fared better with a $380MM sale to Sony in 2012 and now allegedly powers the “Playstation Now” service, and GameFly acquired Playcast in 2015 to deliver what it called a “Netflix for Games” service. 

That term is important, as it has become something of a popular call to arms lately as a number of different companies, from Microsoft to Amazon to Apple to Electronic Arts and a subsidiary of Rovio, have announced products that could be deemed a “Netflix of Gaming”. And in fact, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s CEO, may have tipped his hand for such an endeavor from Netflix itself when he stated that the company “compete(s) with (and lose(s) to) Fortnite more than HBO. When YouTube went down globally for a few minutes in October, (Netflix’s) viewing and signups spiked for that time.”

Almost nothing is known about how Stadia will source content, what it will cost to use, what requirements will be placed on developers in order to have their games appear on the platform, etc. Former Ubisoft executive Jade Raymond recently joined Google to head an internal first-party studio to make games for Stadia, but it’s unknown how large that studio will be or how many games it will publish per year. Google will surely expect to lean heavily on third-party developers for content on the Stadia at launch and for the foreseeable future. As Netflix would certify, being the Netflix of something is expensive: the company is expected to spend $15BN on content in 2019.

And indeed, as this article asserts, the Stadia may be more of a YouTube strategy than a games streaming strategy — or, at least, the Stadia may serve the purpose of further aggrandizing YouTube as games streaming goes mainstream. 50BN hours of gameplay footage were watched on YouTube in 2018, and 200MM people watch gameplay footage each day on YouTube: YouTube is an important part of the gaming ecosystem, and Stadia unifies the viewing experience and the first-hand playing experience in a way that could create a powerful virtuous circle between first-person and third-person gaming engagement. Players will be able to drop pins into gameplay footage on YouTube and then immediately open the game at that moment and start playing. Likewise, players will be able to seamlessly switch between devices, retaining their in situ game state.

It is that last capability that could perhaps be the most monumental promise of Stadia: if every game is playable on a mobile device (all computation is done in the cloud, so end-user hardware profile is irrelevant), then every game is a mobile game. And the Stadia effectively distintermediates the app stores: with Stadia, there is no download requirement in playing a game, and the click-to-stream mechanism effectively extends game discovery to the entire surface area of the web. If game distribution escapes the app stores, then the entire mobile advertising ecosystem could become upended, with a critical pain point — the click-to-install conversion dynamic — being circumvented and otherwise poorly-converting ad inventory like mobile web banners, interstitials, and, conveniently for Google, YouTube inventory becoming suddenly very interesting to mobile advertisers. 

This could be a very interesting development. The mobile app ecosystem has been trending toward intermediation as the biggest mobile properties start to look more and more like app stores themselves; Stadia could change that by abstracting away the idea of an app store, at least as games are concerned. Of course, a vast amount of territory exists between now and Stadia being a hugely successful platform that has materially, indelibly changed the landscape of the mobile app ecosystem. Stadia is a complex, ambitious undertaking, so of course it could fall; it’s frankly annoying that so many media commentators elect to vocalize that very obvious fact.

But if the Stadia is successful, it will have a massive impact on the way that smartphone users interact with games. That possibility is intriguing.

My name is Spinfur or Spin or Spinny or whatever you want to call me I don't mind! I'm always enjoyed the sims franchise as I would watch my older sister and brother play it and I'd play Sims 3 Pets on the playstation, now that I'm older and can afford my own video games though I finally got the Sims 4 and all the expansion packs that come with it. I love creating stories with my sims and even when I do challenges like NSB and all that I still create story that could be unique to other challenges you would see which is fun. I do love creative writing (I mean it's my minor in college) so I guess that's part of the reason why I like to create stories through my sims, however at the current moment I'm starting a SimLit legacy story soon, just trying to plan out what direction I want to take it. I also enjoy reading other sims stories because people here are so talented when it comes to writing ^_^ Anyways if you yall want to chat and stuff feel free to PM me! :D",,Spinfur,United States of America,,,Positive,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,Hello!

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade."" Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft's xCloud, Apple's service is not cloud-based. The company also unveiled its new Apple TV+ service and a variety of exclusive original shows. https://archive.fo/7ANhX Looks like it's mostly indieshit with expected SJW bullshit or basically just a glorified app store+ but at least it's not streaming only yet . ====================::==================== A captivating narrative puzzle that’s also a compelling coming-of-age story. Our hero navigates the insecurities and emotions of high school and beyond, creating pathways and overcoming obstacles. Last one and the one that looks most SJW of the bunch.

It would just shift it (to corporate purchases and large data centers rather than to individuals). Certainly the parceled retail market is better for the seller, so NVIDIA and AMD won't be happy, among others, but there is nothing they can do to stop it. That's why they are adapting. Their retail market, now, is to compete against the ARM manufacturers and those selling cheap, low-power handheld devices.

I think there's a massive difference between PS3 and PS4 game quality and life expectancy. The quality of games on PS4 will have people playing them for a long while to come even after PS5's release whereas the PS3 didn't. Sony would be mad not to capitalise on it in some way with Nintendo and Microsoft doing it already. Hopefully they will offer either PS4 games through a PSNow type service or as the Xbox does it.

The mistake by Sony is thinking that people will just be happy with the bare minimum ie this obvious PSVR trailer they showed off yesterday when they tried to use this “experience” as evidence that we don’t need an e3 presentation and judging by the reaction people don’t seem to agree.You are speculating about them having another one before e3 because there is absolutely nothing saying that’s the case. If you think this is the only mistake I’m referring too than you must not be paying attention.I’m simply stating this is evidence of how little they think they can do and still be number 1, this is more arrogance than anything. I wouldn’t even say it’s that big of a deal compared to the other mistakes they keep making as far as “keeping brand loyalty” is concerned. You don’t see the problem with them claiming this was major and then shoving a blatant PSVR commercial in the face of the consumer still bummed about no E3 when they only aren’t going because “they don’t want to give the competitors attention” yeah..PlayStation really is “for the gamer” lol. When people just brush this off as “there first go” and say”it will be better eventually” there are not holding the company accountable for a poor showing and actually moving the goalposts for how little the PlayStation has to do to keep people on board. If they had nothing of worth to show off at all they should have waited for the first “state of play” to be a vr commercial is setting an awful precedent for the future. I’m glad more people are less like you and are actually speaking out there frustrations with this so now maybe Sony will feel the fire (so to speak) and actually have to have a decent showing next time instead of just assuming “they can do not wrong”. If more people had your attitude we probably would be getting a “psnow” commercial for the next direct....

Did Google build a gaming console? Believe it or not, it actually might have happened.


The behemoth search-engine-turned-world-conqueror released an extremely cryptic teaser on Tuesday ahead of the upcoming Game Developers Conference next week. The video shows a series of densely rendered, 3D locations-many of them reminiscent of classic video game settings, like a racing car garage and an aircraft hangar-with the caption, “Gather around as we unveil Google’s vision for the future of gaming.” 

This isn’t the first time Google has been a presence at GDC. The company made appearances in the past to unveil products and tools, such as the industry-leading AR/VR technology it announced last year. But this year may be different. Following massive developments in its Project Stream beta test, it seems Google is primed to leap into the gaming world in a big way. And when a company like Google says it’s about to rock the boat, we better brace for maximum impact. Here’s everything we know about Google’s mysterious “future of gaming” plans so far.

Gather around as we unveil Google’s vision for the future of gaming at #GDC19. Join us live 3/19 at 10 a.m. PT → https://t.co/rb6fN26PDi pic.twitter.com/Vd242KZAWO

Is Google making a console?

It’s hard to say for sure if Google will unveil hardware at GDC19. Though, as reported by Ars Technica, there are some pretty big giveaways. Rick Osterloh, the senior vice president of hardware at Google, shared the teaser video on his personal Twitter account, seemingly confirming his involvement with the big announcement. And not only that, but, as Ars Technica found, the Google Store is hosting a page for the GDC livestream. If it’s not selling a device of some sort, then why reserve a spot for something on its digital storefront?

Has Google made a console before?

Though Google has never seriously attempted to get into the console race against PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, this would not be the first time it released gaming-ready hardware. Of course, devices like the Google Pixel and any Android phone are all completely capable of running video games, but most of us tend to forget about the short-lived Google Nexus Player. Released in 2014, the Nexus Player was essentially an Apple TV that could run Google’s vast library of Android games with an operating system called “Android TV” and a gaming controller. Though the Nexus Player worked, its fate was similar to other “microconsoles” such as the Mad Catz M.O.J.O or the short-lived Ouya: It failed to attract the attention of the serious console gaming community.

What about that Google controller patent?

A number of tech sites recently shared an image of what looks like a patent filed by Google in January for a gaming controller. PC Gamer says that the patent is actually focused on a “notification system” for a controller. The concept showcases an interface for friend invites, changes in leaderboard status, and app-related functions.

But, lest we forget, companies file patents constantly. For instance, one time Nintendo patented a phone that let you play Super Mario DX. Obviously, nothing ever came of it.






What is Project Stream?

In October of 2018, Google unveiled a limited beta test for its bonkers new streaming tech known as Project Stream. The mind-blowing beta allowed lucky participants to play Ubisoft’s recent Triple-A title, Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey inside their Google Chrome browsers. It’s a wonder this technology wasn’t bigger news at the time. Essentially, if you had access to a computer with a fairly robust internet connection (25 megabits per second, to be exact), you could run Odyssey at pretty much full quality. That’s insane, especially when considering that only 10 years ago, most of the internet was still playing Flash Games on Candystand.com. 

The craziest part? It worked. Beta testers reported that the game ran smoothly within their browsers, and could be played seamlessly with a keyboard and mouse, or controller. The tech is quite complex, but Google pulled it off by taking processing heavy-lifting away from the laptop and putting it into its own server-farms. Through streaming, Google was able to process these high-powered visuals and deliver the game to players via the cloud. Though tech like this already exists, like Sony’s Playstation Now service, it’s bewildering to see it happen inside the same internet browser we all use to check our emails and watch cat videos.

When do we find out the truth about these Google console rumors?

GDC19 starts on Monday, 18 March. Google’s big announcement happens the following day, 19 March.

I'm student and my country's standard is not high and giving even 30$ on sale is kinda a lot. I earn less than 30$ per day as a student, but I would still like to play different game and have versatility in my Vault. That being said, when I had Xbox One before I could enjoy many games (EA Access) for only 30$ per year which was great. Now I really do like my ps4 but I have hard time giving lots of money on new games and I like my hobby. My point is, even tho Sony said EA Access is not a good service for Playstation players I think they are wrong and that option would be really good. Also to add: Playstation Now is not available in .y country, but even if it was I dont like downgraded graphics and high input lag so that doesnt count.

I had 30Mb/s at the time and it ran fine. everyone is just being pissy about this for no reason I don't get it. Their proof of concept was promising. We know nothing about pricing and everything about latency so far has shown it'll be good with a decent internet connection. The amount of negativity considering the lack of information to something that effects people in no way is weird. I don't get it. The way I've seen some people come at Stadia you'd think google killed their first born child.

If Sony had been smarter and specifically screened it's entire back catalogue for games that work well over the internet it would not have been much of an issue combined with developing games specifically for the cloud. That way they could released PSNow on far many more platforms and not needed the massive infrastructure to deliver latency sensitive games. Even a dirt cheap handheld device for 50 bucks to run only PSNow would have been helpful. Latency has gotten better/lower with PSNow over the years but visual quality is still poor even on titles it should not be. Yesterday I fired up Secret of Monkey Island special edition, an old puzzle adventure game and could see visual artifacts quite clearly in the stream for what is mostly a static game with few animations, most other games do not look all that great. Sony's video encoding/capture needs improving. On top of that 30fps games do not run well via cloud streaming, the best games on PSNow are 60fps titles like Rage, that actually felt no different at all from running on local hardware, I suspect this is why Google is targeting 60fps for it's service. I hope Sony can get it's act together, Google's Stadia may or may not succeed but it or another will be part of the future eventually, Sony needs to carve out it's own corner. Google has more money then sense they can price Stadia at whatever they want, Google is the Internet at this point. ​",,coldtires,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

If you're not aware of this fancy new thing Google has been planning to do and make a step further into the future of gaming I will post this Announcement they made down below. I think it's a pretty neat idea but with every gamer that has sunk hours and so much investment into the latest consoles i.e PS4, Xbox One S/X, PC, Switch. This new gaming system is called Stadia. It will run on Vulkan and Linux. Focused on gamers, inspired by developers, and amplified by Youtube creators. Watching a normal game trailer for any game, at the end of the video there will be an option to play that game within the matter of only 5 seconds and it's opened into another browser. I'll cut this description short and let you watch it down below if it seems like something you'd be interested in. I know most people wouldn't be, understandable. Edit: Things I'd be worried about is data caps, relying on Edge Nodes for better performance, you're internet's crappy one day and no games.

PSNow isn’t awful, but for $20/mo to play 720p/30Hz streamed, I don’t think it’s worthwhile. If it were that price with everything being downloadable, not just PS4 games, I could see more appeal, though. It would just feel weird at first. I mean I know we technically don't ""own"" the games that are on physical media, and we technically don't own the digital games we download to our consoles, and we technically won't own any games we stream from a service. But in the first two scenarios, the games can still be played after the company closes (assuming patches are sent to the consoles enabling offline play after the company closes). But with streaming, what if they just pick up and leave?

There are different expectations with console-only games as they drive sales of said console and those subscriptions. For example, in this case Naughty Dog is owned by Sony, so whether they make a profit on the game itself or not, they're gonna profit in other ways. Uncharted 4 for example was PS4's 3rd bestselling game ever, but even that is just 8.7M units. Did it turn a profit? Sure, but not a huge one on the game itself. God of War for all it's accolades sold just 5M copies. Did it turn a profit after development and marketing costs? Probably not. Maybe it broke even. But again, you can get away with those numbers on a console-only game as they make up for that in PS4 sales, PSPlus & PSNow subscriptions. So in the case of companies like EA (who are multiplatform), their profits are tied to the game itself. Something else to consider, but what I would think would be obvious, is that Sony is both a hardware and software manufacturer. They have a wealth of money to allow for purely single player focused games, in addition to letting their games take time before launching. Even in the case of independent studios like CDPR, they've got GoG.com to back them up financially, as well as the Polish government.",,biggydx,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Does a GaaS HAVE to have Multiplayer?,,,

Thinking about for the last hour I am now pretty much convinced, that Google Stadia will succeed. First of all: what means success? Well, in this case I would say it has 50 million monthly active users in five years (2024) each month of the year. And it will grow more, because it isn't disrupted by generations and has to start all over. So, why do I think this? First of all, this was a presentation clearly intended for game developers (no surprise at the Game Developers Conference). And from the perspective of a game developer there was a lot to love. This was not a presentation for gamers - I expect this will happen later. So from a gamers view some things still seem unclear. What was there for a game developer to love? Well, the presentation clearly was intended to show that everyone can pick up gaming pretty simple. Google is lying a bit if they say you don't need something special - you need Chrome. But as pretty much everyone already has it, this hurdle is not very big. So they are showing the game developers a potentially big userbase with no need to sell them something first before they can joining Stadia. Hundreds of millions of people already have a working installation to joining Stadia and play. Secondly they showed that bringing people into playing a game is extremely easy. As easy as an youtube streamer has a simple link and people liking the video can play the same game instantly. This is extremely helpful for smaller developers to bring people to play their game. Google even showed that the youtubers probably can connect closer to the community offering this, so the game developers can be content this feature will be used. Google also convinced them that they have a defined platform so that the developers don't have to add options for different hardware configurations, while this platform is also powerful enough to be not restricting at the moment. I am sure Google will update this standard platform once a year or so, but developers can develop for a defined platform similar to a console, while having few power constraints like on PC. Google also showed that they have the most common middleware like Unreal engine and Unity already lined up for their platform. They also showed how the platform can support game development (the demo showing how different artstyles are applied to a polygon model) and multiplayer. This means more exciting options in games with less development time. This all says to me, that right there at GDC Google will be able to win over a lot of smaller developers for the platform, so that they can show a more impressive lineup then they launch. But Google wasn't sleeping either. In the short video they showed Trials, Just Dance and Assassins Creed, so obviously Ubisoft is on board. The showing of Doom Eternal was registering Bethesda support, but that presentation was actually more to assure the input lag wouldn't be too bad. They also said they have first party development, without going into detail. This more or less shows me, that Google is aware they need games to push the platform and were active in that direction. But why do I think they will succeed? Now, people here are focused on image quality, compression, data plans and input lag. But in reality losses in image quality, compression and data plans isn't holding back Netflix. To the point Disney and Warner decided to start a competition. So while many users in this forum care about this stuff, many people outside this forum will not care or even notice. Input lag could ruin your experience. That's why Google showed Doom Eternal. This is less about the game per se, but more about: look, this game that is really fast-paced works on Stadia and id software is convinced enough of it to go with the platform. So I think Google has reduced the problem enough to make it viable for a majority. Still, avid gamers will complain about the lag. But I am very convinced Stadia will bring a lot of people into gaming, which are currently on the fence or play sporadically. And the potential in this group is huge. Google might have a blue ocean here (not for long, I will come to this). So basically what I take from this presentation is the following: Google knows what they are doing, they touched enough of the points so that I know they thought of it. Stadia could bring many people into gaming which are currently reluctant. The potential is huge, as pretty much everyone has a device with Chrome. They have lined up support from middleware and gaming companies and this presentation was made to bring in more game developers for securing a great lineup. The convinience of this system is better than current console platforms. Why hasn't gaming catched on so far and what does Google differently? Well, the convenience is the main point here. The presentation drove home the point that everyone on pretty much every device can play with Stadia. They need no special client, no special hardware, simply a browser. So far I don't see it that much. I do think though that this offer will not stay unmatched. I can think Microsoft is already thinking in this direction. Also Amazon has the capabilities to offer their own service. But Google has for now started and has the first mover advantage. I see many people in this forum will say Stadia will fail, with the same reasons they explain why Netflix never can work and Bluray is better. The reasons are completely true, but will not matter for the majority of people. And I am pretty much convinced Google has secured the points that matter. 3DS-FC: 4511-1768-7903 (Mii-Name: Mnementh), Nintendo-Network-ID: Mnementh, Switch: SW-7706-3819-9381 (Mnementh) my greatest games: 2017 , 2018 Predictions: Switch / Switch / Switch / MHWorld / GOW > BOTW / Switch vs. XB1 in the US View Post Around the Network The_Liquid_Laser Currently Offline View Profile View Posts Games Collection 5,813 1776 posts since 10/11/17 Recent Badges: Leaving Limbo 100 posts on the gamrConnect forums.

They aren't going to be alone in this game. Either way, I see Stadia being more like Amazon Video than Netflix. A large company, but ultimately with less content and userbase than a smaller, older player in the game which came later to the same innovative, onlie market.

Currently Playing: Far Cry 2 (PC) shikamaru317 10 hours ago I see several roadblocks they will need to overcome: -Lack of high speed internet access in rural areas. Looking like this will take at least 5-10 years to overcome this roadblock, as ISP's are being slow to roll out white space internet and super wi-fi to provide high speed to rural areas -Many ISP's, including the largest in the US, Comcast, have data caps. Comcast has a 1 TB a month cap, and it is being reported that Stadia will use 20 GB per hour, which means you would eat through your entire 1 TB allotment in just 50 hours of gaming. The only thing that is likely to overcome this roadblock is government oversight, the government stepping in to force the ISP's to get rid of data caps, because they have no intention of getting rid of them on their own. -Many ISP's are known to throttle connection speeds for users who do alot of streaming on Netflix and the like, they will very likely do the same for Stadia, which will effect the image quality of the stream. Once again, government oversight is the only thing likely to overcome this barrier, as the ISP's have no intention of getting rid of streaming throttles.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.

People are hyping this up even though there are huge details missing; specifically how much any of this is going to cost and what games are going to be available. They're using Assassin's Creed : Odyssey as a marquee title, when it really isn't one. Can you buy games? Can you rent them specifically? Or is it a shared library that rotates every so often (like Netflix movies). People are suggesing it's going to be cheap, but there isn't a way they can have the games run on thier own hardware and not reasonably pass that cost onto the consumer. XBOX Gamepass/PSNow are ~$100/year (depending on sub length and sales, whatever) but those games are being leveraged by hardware that you already bought (PC, XBOX 1, PS4, whatever) and not being hosted by google's new hardware setup. The specs they listed for the GPU sound similar to a $600-800 card that AMD already makes, meaning that if they use one of those per stadia instance, it's going to add up to huge cash amounts. I would wager it would have to be $40-50/month at a minimum for them to try and make their money back at some point. The library is going to be horrendous because publishers/developers want to sell the game, not to rent it. On Xbox Game pass, the third most recent and ""marquee"" game on there right now is fucking Fallout 4, which you could just grab used for $9 at gamestop or $4 on ebay. PSNow just added Metal Gear Solid 4, which can be had for $3 from a gamestop. There isn't a huge value and unless Google is going to write hilariously huge checks their library is going to be god awful. Even if they do write hilariously huge checks, there is no way it will be worth it to them. I honestly don't think that Google is going to be able to do it. They can't monetize YouTube properly and most streamers/would-be-streamers have likely already invested in stream hardware (capture card on a separate PC) so having ""easy"" access to streaming it doesn't stand out as a selling point. Even if you wanted to do the ""easy access to streaming thing"", Microsoft already tried that with Mixer/Beam a few years back, and the XBOX already had an install base. It just seems like Google is trying to do too much all at once. They're trying to have youtube overtake twitch, while starting up a game development studios after Sony/Microsoft/EA/Activision have been ransacking studios for the last 5+ years, while starting a game streaming service and a digital game library service a few years after Sony and Microsoft started thier's.",,Tanner Glass,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,,,,

I haven't dug very deep into their specific compression technology but whatever the fuck they're doing was warping the audio. I'm a musician and likely much more sensitive to this than the average gamer would be but having the music stutter or change in pitch is a non-starter for me.,,thepensivepoet,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

This could be an issue: ""Google is using Linux as the operating system powering its hardware on the server side. That means game developers will need to port their games to Stadia, and you won’t be able to bring games you already own like some other cloud gaming services (Nvidia’s GeForce Now or Shadow).""

The ps3 was so ridiculously overengineered that the CPU in the PS4 is actually weaker than the Cell is for certain tasks. Making this problem worse is that the Cell in the PS3 handled a lot of tasks you would expect a GPU to do. Every PS3 game ever made is EXTREMELY CPU heavy because of this. Emulating that with the CPU that's in the PS4 just can't be done.

Google new ideas are very hit and miss, though they have a very large fanbase which will give them a nice start even if it is shit (see Tensorflow). Curious to see how this develops, and how especially MS, Sony and possibly Valve react. I guess it is gonna be a few companies who have a lot of exclusives, which mean that you need to subscribe in all of them if you want to access all great games.

 At first glance, Google Stadia impresses. However, I am not convinced about this service . Image streaming is a reliable technology that depends on the network infrastructure of a specific recipient. Not only the speed of its connection, but also delays and distances from the server room. At most moderate successes of such initiatives as OnLive, PlayStation Now or GeForce Now show that streaming games in the quality corresponding to demanding players is a song of the distant future. This future is also at the center of Microsoft’s interest. 



 It’s no secret that Microsoft is working on its own game streaming service. 

 Google Stadia was like Phil Spencer’s nose. Alphabet overtook Microsoft, using the GDC 2019 event to show the world its latest product. No wonder that MS employees could feel uncomfortable. After all, a competitive technology leader praises the world for something they have been working on for many years. Phil Spencer decided to dominate the situation, adding the team’s own e-mail animations. Its content has been sent to the Internet (editorial translation): 

 Our team at GDC just finished watching the Stadia presentation. The show of competition is a confirmation of the rightness of the direction we took ourselves two years ago. The new rival from the tech area entered the competition for the gaming market. His presentation was not surprising, but I’m still impressed by the use of YouTube, Google Assistant and WiFi controller . 

 Returning, however, to us - hard work has meant that we actively participate in the competition for 2 billion players scattered around the entire planet. Today belonged to Google. But in a few months will be our day. We will be great during E3. We must continue to work on the service, with the user always in the center. We have content, we have a community, we have a cloud and we have a strategy. As always, I repeat: everything depends on the level of implementation. Today, implementation is more important than ever before. 

 We are wondering if the Phil Spencer’s e-mail was “leaked” deliberately. 

 The correspondence of the head of the Xbox is not something that regularly flows to the Internet. The leak is very convenient for Microsoft because it moves the reader’s attention from Google Stadia to the upcoming solution from the Xbox camp. Thanks to the corporate e-mail, we know that streaming games will be one of the most important points of Microsoft’s conference at E3 2019. We may also get the impression that Phil Spencer cares about the quality of the service at a higher level than the competition. 

 There is no doubt that MS is not overly satisfied with the new player in the race for streaming games. A similar position probably also dominates in Sony, where streaming has been actively developed for many years, in the form of PlayStation Now. Google Stadia is a foreign element that can disrupt the traditional course of competition for the player and his wallet. That’s why I will not be surprised if the expansion of PlayStation Now into new markets will be faster than ever before, and Microsoft will take great hits at its own conference.

Of course ignoring that everytime we talk about xCloud it always ends being PSNow that's on trial... Especially due to the fact that above poster, somehow, in 2019 doesn't seem to understand or know the difference between WIFI and the Internet.......... Facts: Fact 1) PS3 to PSP Internet streaming existed in 2006. This means that a PSP could remotely connect to a PS3 AND PLAY GAMES in 2006 hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Which is the current crux of modern games streaming. This was almost 15 years ago...... Fact 2) Sony, is the FIRST and ONLY mainstream console stream feature of any of the major consoles. This is NOT debatable. The fact is Sony has had the technology to perform real-time video compression/decompression and sending it across the internet to a remote PSP while also working on control input latency and they've been doing this for a decade and a half. FACT 3) PSNow was originally for PS3 games which generally were not HD nor greater than 30fps. The fact is for the vast majority of the PSNow existence there was no need to deliver anything greater than 720P and 30fps and there still is not when the bulk of PSNow is played on PS4s which can download games which would play at 1080P and 60fps. Fact 4) PSNow shares streaming technology with Remote Play which can do 1080P and 60fps over the internet. However I can understand the failure to understand business decisions vs technological limitations from someone who does not know the difference between Wifi and internet... Fact 5) PSnow was originally conceived with using PS3 hardware in server farms. This means there would always be a finite number of devices which can run concurrently. This has recently changed in NA because they no longer have queuing information if you were to visit their current page. The xCloud solution is the same as Sony's 5 years ago which was to put server versions of last generation's hardware in server farms. Fact 5) Attempting to compare GeForce Grid or even Project Stream against a service which the bulk of games are not even HD compatible does not make sense. Grid, Stream etc play PC versions of games with higher resolutions and assets. The same for Onlive and Gaikai. It's no different than comparing Console game resolutions to PCs. They are different customer bases running different software. Also not sure what the ridiculous comparison to RDP is... No one has ever ever ever done remote game streaming of console games before. Fact 6) NO ONE HAS EVER EVER EVER DONE REMOTE INTERNET STREAMING OF CONSOLE GAMES BEFORE. PERIOD. THIS IS NOT DEBATABLE. No one is acting as if Sony created the entire concept, however the fact is they have been doing what no one else has been doing for years. They have had the technology to minimize latency between a gaming device and a client and compress video, stream it across the internet, and then decompress it on a client in real-time. This is NOT a small feat, nevermind the fact that Sony had this working almost 15 years ago on a PS3 and PSP no less. FOR CONTEXT THIS PRE-DATES EVEN NETFLIX'S STREAMING SERVICES WHICH LAUNCH IN 2007!!!! Ignoring the feat of that technological achievement is absurd. Speculation following: PSNow has shifted to a Netflix style offering which allows a subscription fee for all access streaming. Similar to Netflix. Also similar to Netflix it now offers a download option. I've speculated before even before the iOS app release. The future of PSNow isn't in their data centers and it will remain an option rather than the primary means of game streaming delivery. My theory is that PS5 will be fully backwards compatible PS1-4 locally. This will allow gamers to download every game in the PSNow offering to their own home PS5 and then remote play to the device of their choosing. What are the benefits to this? It's been shown that the bulk of gaming and movie watching occurs inside the home. Rather than enforcing streaming from a cloud server which adds latency and requires high server availability. Resources are better utilized allowing users to locally play games and from their own devices free of charge and using PSNow to supplement that library through downloads and having the highest frame-rate and resolution possible. My speculation is already coming to fruition. The opening of iOS apps to remote play is consistent with that strategy. Anyway. Severely off topic but wanted to correct the gross amount of misinformation. Unfortunately everytime we start to talk about xCloud as an actual tangible product, somehow PSNow is put on trial rather than examining what Microsoft is actually offering... Ignoring everything else. I likely wouldn't take my information from someone who doesn't understand the difference between Wifi and the internet anyway......",,michaelmikado,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

While I think getting Sony to approve a PS4 app for Google's platform may be a hard sell, I wouldn't mind an app on the Switch. 3. Good exclusives.

But the fact they compared the power of the A12X to an Xbox One may be a sign of things to come. If Apple were serious about games, they would release a dedicated TV model because the current design really cannot accommodate any AAA game. They need to bundle a pair of controllers and give it a descent amount of storage. That'd be at least 1TB, and given the price of SSD's of that size, a fusion drive would be in order, which would have consequences on the size of the box. Or they may offer an optional ""gaming kit"" that would include controllers and an external USB-C drive (SSD or fusion). You can't really make a small media box and pretend it's a game console. The current TV shows it doesn't work. Given the current games the 4K AppleTv is adequate if they have a streaming solution like Google’s New Stadia or Sony’s PlayStation Now service.

The fact that it's possible to do now with 200ms of lag in most areas is an incredible feat. It may not be entirely usable yet, but it's still an awesome accomplishment. (I've played a few games on PSNow that have run better than that. Not consistently right enough, and I live in an area with good internet.) Just look at the leaps and bounds in online gaming in general over the last two decades. We've come so far. And the technology behind sending the V/A and inputs back and forth for streaming games isn't all that different from what's in place currently for multiplayer. There's just a lot more data getting sent to the end user, and possibly an extra trip each side for the inputs in a multiplayer game. But that'll only be an issue with cross service multiplayer. Eventually with cloud gaming, when you're playing a multiplayer game, you'll actually be streaming a local game, not an over-the-internet one. I think some Sony games on PSNow might do this already. Speaking of Stadia though, I don't know how well Google are gonna do with this. The main worry for me is how they'll market it on their platforms. It's got a lot of potential in the casual market in its current form. But they seem to be selling it to the core gamer audience as something akin to Valve or Nvidia's game anywhere products. And even those haven't done too well. The web tech in general isn't there for the core gamer to play consistently without complaint. I think the big push with Stadia should be on the Play Store on phones. Banners in the game section advertising the Stadia controller, phone attachment and some mainstream AAA titles like CoD and AC. They could make it massive. Android as a true mobile gaming device could easily put a massive dent in Nintendo's monopoly.",,shaxamo,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Google is getting into game streaming. The company today revealed Stadia, the evolution of its efforts to make digital, on-demand video games reliable and viable. It’ll be available this year in the US, Canada, the UK and Europe. Google dropped the news during an hour-long showcase at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.

Google’s plans for its streaming service bring the industry’s “Netflix for games” promises to life. Ideally, it will allow folks to play any game on any connected device – think Devil May Cry 5 on your iPhone, Dead Cells on your smart TV or Apex Legends on a Mac. Stadia will be able to stream games in 4K, 60FPS and HDR color at launch, but eventually it’ll support up to 8K.

However, it’s also much more than that.

More connection means more consumerism, and Stadia will allow developers to sell their games in new ways, including directly via YouTube and Twitch live streams. For example, load up a trailer for Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey on YouTube and, at the end, click the “Play” button and the game will load in as little as five seconds in your Chrome browser, ready to play. That’s all it’ll take.

Stadia’s Crowd Play feature allows people watching a YouTube livestream to jump in line and actually join that streamer’s game. State Share, meanwhile, lets folks to send links to specific sections of a game, and their friends can then simply click and play from there in the Chrome browser.

Google has been preparing for its foray into video games for years, hiring a handful of high-profile executives including former Sony studios and Xbox head Phil Harrison, and Assassin’s Creed visionary Jade Raymond. Raymond is officially the head of Stadia Games and Entertainment, Google’s new game-development arm.

The Big G has also been testing out its streaming prowess. The Project Stream beta test kicked off last year, allowing some folks to play Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey, a new and sprawling AAA game, via the Chrome browser. We tried it out and found it worked well, running Ubisoft’s fancy new title seamlessly on a 2015 Macbook Air.

Google isn’t the only tech giant making moves in the game-streaming space. Microsoft already has the Xbox Game Pass subscription service and it’s reportedly building a streaming-focused console that’ll be announced soon – E3 is just around the corner, after all – while NVIDIA’s Geforce Now has offered seamless play for a few years, in beta. PlayStation Now is also a thing, though it’s still fairly unreliable day-to-day. Those are just two potential competitors for Google, but rest assured there are plenty more lurking right behind.

Google has an advantage over some companies with its robust cloud network that includes more than 7,500 nodes positioned around the world. Leading game-engine companies including Unreal and Unity, and studios like Doom creator id Software, are partnering with Google on Stadia as well.",,us-yahoo-entertain-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfsdfasdf,Post,,

183578184991,3/19/2019,http://bigbudget.tumblr.com/post/183578184991,"After months of speculation, Google has unveiled its new cloud gaming platform. It’s called Stadia, a name designed to conjure up images of people playing games throughout history. And Stadia will let you stream games anywhere and everywhere on multiple devices.

What Is Google Stadia and How Will It Work?

Google Stadia is a cloud-based gaming platform. This means that rather than needing to upgrade or buy new hardware, you’ll be able to play games on existing devices. This includes your PC or laptop, Chromebook, tablets, smartphones, and even smart TVs.



Google wants high-end, AAA games to be available on Stadia. The company tested the service using Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, and Doom Eternal has already been confirmed for launch. However, it remains to be seen how many other titles Google can secure.

Stadia will be able to stream games in 4K HDR at 60fps. To make this possible, AMD has built Google a custom GPU more powerful than the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. Google has also developed its own controller, but you can also use your existing controllers.

YouTube will play an integral part of Stadia, with viewers watching someone play games able to start playing for themselves just by clicking a “Play Now” button. The Stadia controller also features a share button allowing you to share footage on YouTube.



Google will be launching Stadia sometime in 2019, and has promised more details will be forthcoming this summer. We know Stadia will be launching first in the United States, Canada, the UK, and most of Europe, but there’s no word yet on pricing.

Can Google Stadia Live Up to the Hype?

Cloud gaming services such as PlayStation Now already exist. However, most have struggled with lag, preventing them from huge success. If Google has fixed this issue, and Stadia lives up to the hype from the GDC announcement, then it could be a game-changer.

Stadia is an exciting development worth keeping an eye on, and we’ll probably find out more at Google I/O 2019 in May. However, if you’re not yet ready to ditch your console, read our PS4 Pro review and our Xbox One X review to help you choose between the two.

You basically play a game remotely on Google's servers so you can play it on any device with streaming capabilities. There have been several of these services in the past with the most notable being Onlive as the first big one that crashed and burned along with PSNow which is the first successful commercial attempt at it. Cloud gaming works great in Japan and many companies offer rentals of big titles on the Nintendo Switch through cloud gaming there. Outside of Japan, cloud gaming has been pretty non-existent for many reasons: 1. The political landscape of the US (one of Google's largest markets) has resulted in an almost complete monopoly of ISPs. Google Fiber rollout was stopped by local government corruption. This means most Americans have things like unreliable internet, slow internet, or (the biggest threat to cloud gaming) data caps. 2. The US is big. In order to provide a good cloud gaming solution, you need a lot of data centers. Cloud Gaming data centers have to be dedicated solely to Cloud Gaming (which Google is also doing) which makes the cost far greater than most of Google's previous endeavors. 3. Cloud gaming has latency. Even Google's presentation revealed this latency. There are entire genres that simple don't work enjoyably with cloud gaming. It is fine for more cinematic and casual gaming but many games simply don't work on it. 4. People who can afford cloud gaming probably have the means to acquire a dedicated device that don't have to deal with the other listed issues. The reason people are so excited for this technology is because it is made by Google who is a massive company with many talented engineers. In their minds, Google can succeed where Onlive and Sony's PSNow failed. It is more pure faith at this point in technology that hasn't been reliable for most.",,TheWorldisFullofWar,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

With Google announcing Stadia and Xbox rumored to be announcing their cloud based service at E3, it amazes me that Sony has been pushing this for almost half a decade now. It certainly had its fair share of problems at launch and is by no means perfect today, but I feel like service today is in a much better spot than it has ever been. I’m interested to see how it evolves over the coming months and years as its competitors join in the market. Personally, I hope they push to add more exclusives, get at least some big new games to release on the platform, and maybe even have it tie in with PlayStation plus in some way. Anyways, this is just something I’ve been thinking about a bit lately.

Here’s what to expect [br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095344.png""][br][br][br][br]Google is making a big play in gaming next week, but we’re still unsure exactly what that entails. For years, the company has toyed with the idea of getting involved in what is now the biggest sector of the entertainment industry, worth an [a href=""https://lpesports.com/e-sports-news/the-video-games-industry-is-bigger-than-hollywood""]estimated $138 billion dollars as of last fall[/a]. And it would make competitive sense: Amazon owns Twitch, Facebook acquired Oculus, and Microsoft has Xbox. The only other major tech company without a serious gaming platform or investment of its own, not counting mobile app stores, is Apple, although even the iPhone maker is now [a href=""https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/apple-reportedly-plans-netflix-for-games-subscription-service/""]rumored to be working on a game subscription service of its own[/a].[br][br]Google has always had many of the pieces required to challenge the likes of Sony and Nintendo. The Android operating system is the most-used mobile software on smartphones around the world, while the Chrome browser and Chromecast streaming platform have given the company an easy way to run applications in real time and access television sets. It’s not hard to imagine an Android or browser-based gaming service that can let you play advanced software on a living room TV.[br][br]But, until now, all we’ve seen are a few strong hints to what Google might be building. That changes on Tuesday of next week, when Google plans to hold its [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262215/google-gdc-19-keynote-event-teaser-video-project-stream""]first-ever keynote at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco[/a]. There’s been a lot of news over the past few months that gives us a good idea at what’s to come, but whatever Google does announce, it could have a big impact on an industry that is transforming how it builds, distributes, and sells games. Here’s a rundown what we know so far and what we think might be coming next week.[br][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095355.png""][br][br][br]Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge[br] It’s highly likely it involves cloud gaming [br][br]In teasing its GDC keynote, Google said it would unveil its “vision for the future of gaming.” And, going off numerous previous reports and public showings from the company itself, it’s highly likely the announcement involves a full-fledged cloud gaming service. [a href=""https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-may-step-into-gaming-with-yeti-streaming-service""]More than a year ago[/a], The Information first reported about Google’s Project Yeti, the codename for an internal division responsible for building a next-generation streaming service similar to existing but limited options like Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now.[br][br]Even before Sony and Nvidia’s services existed, cloud gaming had been a bit like the industry’s holy grail: a just-out-of-reach ideal that has preoccupied a number of startups like OnLive, Gaikai, and others, but that’s never been cracked because the infrastructure and economics haven’t been properly worked out.[br][br]CLOUD GAMING HAS BEEN THE INDUSTRY’S HOLY GRAIL FOR YEARS[br][br]The concept is relatively simple. What if, like Netflix and Spotify, you could not only digitally distribute games, but also stream them over the internet, so players wouldn’t need expensive hardware to play graphically-intensive titles? It’s difficult because games, unlike other forms of media, are both incredibly large in size and require real-time input from players. But it is doable, by wiring up the necessary hardware in a data center, running the game on a remote machine, and sending the video and receiving player commands over the internet.[br][br]Regardless, it’s been impressive how many additional companies have revealed cloud gaming services in the past few years, turning what was once a niche experimental effort in an industry-wide race to figure out the future. Microsoft has [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263405/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-demo-video""]gone public with its own game streaming platform[/a], xCloud, that it plans to start testing later this year. EA, after acquiring the rental and cloud gaming service GameFly, is [a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/eas-project-atlas-wants-your-gaming-to-run-on-cloud-computing-and-ai/""]now working on a product of its own called Project Atlas[/a]. Even Verizon is getting into the game, with a [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179048/verizon-gaming-video-game-streaming-service-vzg-nvidia-shield-android""]test service up and running on Nvidia Shield set-top boxes[/a]. Earlier this week, [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265818/valve-steam-link-anywhere-personal-cloud-service-gaming-pc-gdc-2019""]Valve expanded its Steam Link service[/a] to turn it into a personal cloud gaming app. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177253/amazon-cloud-gaming-service-rumor-job-posting""]Both Amazon and Nintendo[/a]are looking into the technology, too.[br][br]There’s been a number of obvious signs that Google is indeed working on cloud gaming. Most prominently, Google [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17924492/google-project-stream-game-assassins-creed-odyssey-free-testing""]launched its public test of Project Stream[/a], an experimental game streaming technology that worked directly in its Chrome browser. Through a partnership with Ubisoft, Google let you play the brand-new Assassin’s Creed Odyssey — without needing to purchase the game — on pretty much any machine, given you had a strong enough internet connection.[br][br]GOOGLE’S PROJECT STREAM TEST IS AN OBVIOUS SIGN OF WHAT’S TO COME[br][br]It was a remarkable experiment, not [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950998/google-project-stream-gaming-assasins-creed-odyssey-first-impression""]just because it actually worked quite well[/a], but also because a game studio as large as Ubisoft agreed to let one of its biggest launches of the year be a test subject. The test is now over, but Google [a href=""https://blog.google/technology/developers/pushing-limits-streaming-technology/""]set out to gather data[/a] from what it considered a “technical test to solve some of the biggest challenges of streaming,” data that could help inform whatever product it announces next week.[br][br]There’s also been a lot of strategic hires in the past 18 months or so that hint toward a large, legitimate push into the gaming sector. Phil Harrison, a long-time executive of both Sony and Microsoft’s Xbox team, [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/22/16921214/phil-harrison-google-games""]joined Google last year[/a] as a general manager and vice president, but working in an disclosed capacity. At the time, it was believed Harrison was going to help Google build out its virtual and augmented reality platforms as viable gaming businesses. But Harrison was also on the board of game streaming company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/16/4442372/inside-gaikai-how-to-make-cloud-gaming-as-easy-as-watching-youtube""]Gaikai[/a], a company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4010420/sonys-playstation-4-will-use-gaikai-game-streaming-technology""]acquired by Sony in 2012[/a] and instrumental to the launch of its PlayStation Now service. So it’s likely Harrison is helping Google in its similar efforts.[br][br]Later in the year, [a href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1564647&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjackbuser%2F""]Google hired Jack Buser[/a], who was a senior director at Sony’s game streaming unit and led the PlayStation platform’s social efforts before that. Shortly after, Google [a href=""https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/30/google-hires-sonys-playstation-vr-guru-and-magic-lab-head-richard-marks/""]also hired Sony senior research engineer Richard Marks[/a], who helped build the PlayStation VR headset and Move controller.[br][br]And just last week, gaming industry veteran Jade Raymond [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/13/18263911/jade-raymond-google-vp""]also joined Google as a vice president[/a], though we don’t what team or division she’ll be leading. The timing may not be coincidental. Raymond, who was executive producer and co-creator of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed and later joined Electronic Arts, could be heading up some type of creative division at Google, or one responsible for developer outreach given her connections at big studios and publishers.[br][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][br][br]Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge[br][br] There’s a hardware component, and it may involve Chromecast [br][br]We don’t have too much to go on regarding what this service might look like, but we do know that there’s a strong likelihood there is custom Google hardware involved. Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware and its senior vice president of devices, tweeted out a link to the GDC keynote earlier this week:[br][br]Osterloh oversees Pixel phones, Google Home devices, and the myriad other hardware products the search giant now produces in-house. Whether that means we’re getting a Pixel-branded cloud gaming console or something else entirely is unclear. But it’s interesting nonetheless to see Osterloh involved in some way. [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]Kotaku[/a] [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]’s Jason Schreier[/a], who corroborated many of the initial details about Google’s upcoming service last summer, also reported that hardware will be one of three big components to the service, the other two being streaming and a massive in-house developer division that sounds very much like what Raymond could be involved in.[br][br]If we had to speculate on what exactly a Google game-streaming platform look like, we don’t have to look too hard. That’s because it could very well already exist, at least in part, as Chromecast. Google’s streaming dongle is already capable of letting you play Android games on your TV using screen mirroring from a compatible smartphone.[br][br]Now, that’s not to say that this new game streaming platform will just piggyback off Chromecast. But Chromecast does provide a model for how Google might go about delivering gaming experiences to a TV. For one, it’s a no-frills package that plugs in through one port and stays out of the way. And because cloud gaming, like media streaming, doesn’t require a ton of local processing power, the hardware can be lightweight and cheap. Given the amount of buzz Google is creating here though, it seems more likely it’ll drop all-new hardware specifically for gaming.[br][br] There could be a game controller to go with it [br][br]You can’t have console-quality gaming (if that is indeed what Google is going for) without some type of peripheral. For Google, that means building your own controller. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257911/google-patent-game-controller-project-stream-streaming-service-render""]According to a patent revealed late last week[/a], that might be exactly what the company has done, with images showing off a Google-branded gamepad that like a cross between a PlayStation controller and the [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]ill-fated[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] [/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]Ouya’s[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] gamepad[/a] from a half-decade ago.[br][br][br][br][br][br][br]Image: Google[br][br]This, even if Google doesn’t produce an actual console, might be why Osterloh’s hardware division is involved. For one, if Microsoft and Sony are building competing services, Google might not want its customers using other companies’ controllers.[br][br]And it’s a no-brainer that a service of this type would need to be first-and-foremost a controller-centric experience. As it stands right now, any kind of cloud gaming service is probably going to have at least some issues with connectivity. The bar for console game performance is much lower than on PC, where competitive games require the best connections possible and even milliseconds of latency matter to hardcore players.[br][br]In other words, this probably isn’t going to launch as a mouse-and-keyboard experience, at least not at first. So while we might not get Fortnite , Apex Legends , or Dota 2 on Google’s platform, there’s a good chance this service could very well be a place to play big-budget, single-player games like Assassin’s Creed .[br][br]",,,France,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Everything we think we know about Google’s mystery gaming announcement,,,

This can't possibly end up being a viable experience for anyone on your average internet connection.

They love to spend a billion dollars on a project and then abandon it by the side of the road, senseless in a ditch with its panties on backwards. I hope folks are ready for that. * Primary concern...this is another step on the path of erasing the past. This hurts as a retro-gamer.

Unlike Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, Sony doesn't have the cloud server network and infrastructure to offer their streaming services worldwide. That is why PSNow has such spotty coverage. Sony is going to have buy cloud coverage from others or invest a lot of money to set up the infrastructure to compete against those other 3 worldwide not only on consoles but also on PC, phones and tablets. With both Google and Amazon entering the fray along with MS. I dont see it being worth Sonys time to try and build infrastructure in countries where it doesnt have any. The other companies are going to have a couple of legs up on them there. Just concentrate on the successful hardware business and only worry about streaming in the wealthy countries where they already have infrastructure and broadband speeds and adoption rates support the technology. Software sales is where they make the most profit though. Hardware sales especially consoles don't really earn the manufacturers that much profit. I think they even incur a loss or close to one on every console they sell. It is the software that they sale on those consoles where they get most of their profit. That is why MS, Google and Amazon has decided to go after the larger mobile and PC market via live streaming where software sales combined dwarf what is available on consoles.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Sony and Nintendo is just good for playing their few exclusives Sony yes, but the Switch is also the only proper handheld in the market (other than the 3DS). This was just announced today.

Partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more--more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall,"" with pricing and more details to come. Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft's xCloud, Apple's service is not cloud-based.

If all my games are on a cloud service, then I won't have access to any of the files should the service ever go down.

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » I haven't tried a game streaming service, so I'm kind of curious about the latency and speed of light issues that people were talking about. Is it something that makes tons of games simply unplayable for anyone who's ever gone into a settings menu, or does the latency just mean that you maybe don't get a good experience with the twitchiest games, like competitive shooters and fighting games? Armchair seemed to suggest that this would mostly only be useful for turn based games, but people indicated they were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey well enough, and it seems like PSNow has been doing it since 2014. Are streamed games just garbage to play over PSNow, or is it not as bad as all that? I played AC:O on Stream and it worked really well. I was using 100mbps wired Fios. I went in there specifically to test the latency and I'd say it matched my expectations of what a best-case scenario looks like for the tech. i.e. if you watch the screen closely as you press a button on the controller you'll definitely see it, and it's not my preference to sacrifice any input latency, but I could easily play the game that way and get used to it. A lamen player who isn't technical enough to be looking for latency probably would not notice it. That's on a controller though, using mouselook I really didn't like it.

For the purpose of argument, let’s assume that Google Stadia just works. Internet speed, latency and visual quality isn’t an issue. Is the product good enough to stand up on its own merits? Let’s also presume a Netflix-style subscription service (the most likely price model) rather than a Steam-like storefront. And thirdly in this rather generous scenario, Stadia is offering a wide library of games you actually want.

On the one hand, you would be able to immediately access a game you see on YouTube, play it, share it with your friends and seamless move it between devices, be it a smartphone, tablet, TV or potato laptop, without worrying about hardware investment. You could try out games early and find out if they’re good without committing $60 a pop to pre-orders or hundreds of dollars for next-gen hardware.

On the other hand, there are some glaring disadvantages to the model even if it works well. You don’t own the games yourself, they could be pulled by Google at any moment, and can’t be modded, played offline or saved for posterity. Not ideal, but if the price is right, it could well work for many.

Writing about how Stadia could compete in the gaming market, I guessed about $15-$20 for a subscription service to take on rivals like PlayStation Now, Xbox Game Pass, and Shadow. But Google might go even cheaper than that. After all, the company makes its money from our data by offering a suite of free online services like Google Photos, Gmail, Google Docs and so on. It’s Google Home range of smart speakers are very aggressively priced, and Mountain View may similar try to undercut the entrenched gaming giants as much as possible.

Are there any regular gamers ready to ditch their prized hardware? Anyone who’d like to game more but would prefer an on-demand streaming model to the traditional market?",,prosyscomtech,Singapore,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

I've seen it compared to a 720p service, with higher latency than people are reporting from Google's test of Assasin's Creed. And think about that - it was pretty much 'the' AAA title of the moment. Google already have the next Doom. Sony's offering is not at all comparable - and I speak from someone who has an interest in old PS3/4 exclusives and a free month's trial. What you are getting is the bargin bucket, with just a smattering of AA's. I go back to check every month, but I've never seen ANYTHING that has driven me to fork out all £0.00. Having said that, it appears the Unfinished Swan has finally made on the list, so I'll probably get it - for that one, extremely niche title. The only truly stand out offering would appear to be Bloodborne. The rest is either of zero interest to me, or avaliable for PC at much, much higher quality and usually for very low prices. The reality is, if they made individual games available to stream at reasonable prices, there is every chance I would already have paid up a few times. I think this is where people might be mistaken about Google's offering. Everyone seems to be expecting a flat-monthly-fee for library access on the lines of Netflix. I don't think this can possibly work if they are releasing multiple AAA titles from third party studios. Netflix don't offer the latest. They offer a huge catalogue of good stuff, but you'll never see any of the top ten selling Blu-Ray movies, or the premium classics. MS, it's true, are pursuing the flat-fee model, but that's 15 a month for one single publisher's output, and it comes with the caveat that the Xbox is still the cheapest entry hardware, so they are locking in consumers. So I expect Google's model to run closer to Amazon Prime Video. The flat fee gets you a good library (not Netflix good, but close) and other benefits. I expect it to tie into Youtube Prime. They already have succeeded in make running standard youtube on android a frustrating experience for people used to the desktop site, and constantly badger you to upgrade). For the latest AAA releases, they will want more money, just as they do for the latest blockbuster AAA movie releases. Or they could charge on a game by game basis, just as they do with Youtube Movies, maybe - at a pinch - charging by time played. It offers so much flexibility for developers to find the right model for them. Multiplayer could mix pay for playtime with premium purchases? AAA with first hour free, followed by flat fee? Indies just taking royalties from the platform? Games where we pay for chapters or season? The Netflix strictly flat fee alternative everyone is talking about would appear to be a strange route to go. It might work for developers investing £100m and indies investing their precious time to port to the platform - but you'd be looking at prohibitively expensive flat fee in the region of £50 per month. ​",,That_LTSB_Life,United States of America,,,Negative,Unclassified,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Depending on what games you play this could be a good deal. In my home FIFA and NBA Live is all that we've been playing for some time. So a yearly subscription providing those titles are included would mean massive savings for me. I thought NBA Live died like 10 years ago",,Djkhalid1921,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA Access could reportedly be on the way to PlayStation 4,,,

Digital foundry posted a comparison between current platforms: (this isn't clear, but this is with display lag factored in on all platforms) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG06H7IQ9Aw This video shows that there are compromises being made, especially with regards to the artifacting. The visuals are simply not as crisp as running the game locally, and it will probably never be as crisp. The latency, though? It's generally fine, really. Even 200ms latency isn't the end of the world. You're already used to higher latency figures than you probably realize. Developers have methods to account for latency when designing games for/porting games to the Stadia. I've played games on PSNow and they were perfectly playable even with my unoptimal home wifi, using sony's probably inferior streaming network. I think there's also a definite audience for this. There are a lot of people out there who would hop into AAA gaming if only it were more accessible. People you probably don't think of as traditional gamers. And this is about as accessible as you can make it. I'm still skeptical that google can give us a combination of crisp visuals and low latency, but I honestly don't mind them trying.

It will run on Vulkan and Linux. Focused on gamers, inspired by developers, and amplified by Youtube creators. Watching a normal game trailer for any game, at the end of the video there will be an option to play that game within the matter of only 5 seconds and it's opened into another browser.

Edit: Things I'd be worried about is data caps, relying on Edge Nodes for better performance, you're internet's crappy one day and no games.

183468862081,3/15/2019,http://slimgigs.tumblr.com/post/183468862081,"Enlarge / This kind of streaming setup now works anywhere with a good enough Internet connection, not just in the house. Valve Corporation 


In a major expansion to its years-old in-home game-streaming efforts, Valve announced today that Steam users can now stream games from their PC gaming libraries to devices outside the home as well.

The Steam Link Anywhere program, launched in beta today, lets users stream games from “any computer running Steam” to:

 * Any other computer running Steam (even on a different network) 
 * Any mobile device running the Steam Link app (sorry, iOS users are still out of luck) 
 * Any Steam Link hardware box (if you can still find one) 
The only requirements for today’s “early beta” release, according to the announcement, are that “your computer has good upload speed and your Steam Link device has a good network connection.” Those are imprecise terms, of course, but Steam’s in-home streaming has previously shown a pretty good ability to scale visual quality up and down based on network conditions.
 Valve’s announcement comes just days before Google is expected to announce its own streaming gaming service and hardware at next week’s Game Developers Conference. But that service will likely mirror other subscription services like GeForce Now or PlayStation Now, which stream a selection of games running on powerful centralized servers. Steam Link Anywhere is more akin to Nvidia’s GameStream service, which essentially lets your home gaming rig serve as the server to stream games you already own.

Just last week, Sony released new PS4 firmware allowing users to stream PS4 games to their iOS devices, expanding a capability that was already available on Android and the PlayStation Vita.

Promises of powerful gaming were given, available on a variety of hardware solutions. It’s a cloud-based gaming system. Running off powerful Linux servers, they promise 4K gameplay on all your devices with a Chrome browser. Chromecast, Pixelbook, tablet, ect. Pricing has not been announced. Here’s more info on Stadia (that we know right now): https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273977/google-stadia-cloud-game-streaming-service-report So personally, I’m skeptical about this. First, streaming to me seems more restrictive than anything else. This is largely dependent on the quality of the internet connection. Google has done things to try to minimize lag on their end, but it still has to get to our ISPs, then to our houses. I don’t foresee it being a smooth experience all the time. Other people have pointed out things like data caps being an issue too. Trying it on mobile data is probably not going to work very well either. I’m not overly fond of streaming games either. I know they’re not the first to do it. Microsoft Project xCloud and PlayStation Now are two I can think of. I don’t think I’ve even used the GeForce Now with my NVidia Shield devices since I bought my Shield Portable, and that’s been in Free Beta for years now. I’m a physical game person, but even digital only seems like a better value than this. At least I can play digital games anywhere I want, even without using Internet (after the initial download). I also fear with Stadia, older games that don’t get played much will be “retired.” I’ll go to play an old favorite, and it’ll be gone. If they offer a free trial for this, I might at least try it out. If it’s a very low cost (like free, ad-supported option), I might use it to demo certain games before purchasing them myself on PC or Console. So what are your thoughts on this? Viable platform, or scary dystopian future where you have even less ownership of your games?",,jeffrey,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,Google Stadia revealed.

On a scale of ""practically 0"" to bitcoin², how bad would it be? Economies of scale work generally work in favor of data centers over PCs doing heavy lifting. So a game being rendered at their server farm will generally be more energy efficient than your PC doing the same work. From a manufacturing standpoint, it's also more efficient to make 100 GPUs and run them 24 hours a day in a data center than it is to make 2400 GPUs and run them 1 hour per day in consumer PCs. As far as rendering a game, compressing each frame, and sending it over a network? That I'm not sure about.

PC gaming? Never. I just never see it in kids under 14. For them its about convenience. Quality is secondary. Sigh... pulling a ""no true Scotsman""? Really? We're not talking about the sub-14 crowd here. We're talking about the entire market. Console, casual, and mobile games are about convenience. That's what game services like Stadia, Playstation Now, and Geforce Now are targeting. PC gaming has always been about the cutting edge. The reactions people get when they saw RTX/Realtime Raytracing in 2018, Crysis in 2008, Star Citizen when Procedural Planets were unveiled (""Pupil to planet"" promo video), 4k gaming at 144 hz when non-PC gaming experiences can't even deliver 1080p at 30 hz... This is where PC gaming has always been and where it'll always be. Services like Stadia aren't going to attract the PC gamer who demands the true PC gaming experience (anyone who currently goes through the trouble of building a high-end gaming PC right now). Console, casual, and mobile games live in the ""zero to gaming in as little time as possible"" world and that's why it's going to get killed off by services like Stadia. Stadia-type services are going to split the console gamers in two parts; the ones that value convenience will leave move to Stadia while the more ""serious"" console gamers will move to gaming PC + controller setups. PC gaming won't disappear (it'll probably grow) but console gaming? Yeah... Stadia-type services will kill that.",,Draiko,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I’ve been subscribed to shadow for months. It’s a cloud streaming subscription where you “rent a PC” in a data center. The closest data center to me is about 9 hours away, and even then I’m comfortably playing battlefield and a little bit of cod. The input lag is almost unnoticeable, is is completely unnoticeable in any game that isn’t twitch heavy. This service is from some no name French start up company and is still amazing. It’s really not as bad as people think, and if anyone can kill the lag problem it’s google. It’s already been shown in certain circumstances, stadia can match the internal input lag of the Xbox one. Then there’s the people that hate streaming because they are afraid they won’t own their games, all the while purchasing digital copies of games and not realizing they can just lose those to. Then you’ve got people that don’t trust google with their information... While posting on their reddit account, while they probably use YouTube, or have a Facebook or a Twitter. Get over yourself.

Also visual quality is quite poor with whatever Sony is using for compression. Google is targeting 60fps and will likely deliver decent image quality, the WiFi controller is a clever addition too.

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Wait so if I paid £19.99 for my years subscription I could play FIFA for free?

183609929450,3/21/2019,http://engadget-in-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183609929450,"Phil Harrison won’t budge. As a vice president and general manager at Google, he’s spent the past 15 minutes explaining why Stadia, the company’s freshly announced game-streaming service, will actually work on the existing internet infrastructure across North America and Europe. He’s focused on the investments Google has made over the past 20 years in cloud networks, talking up the company’s 7,500 server nodes, custom CPUs and partnerships with major internet service providers.

I’m hesitant to believe him. I lived through the hype of OnLive a decade ago; we’ve heard these promises before, only to be sorely disappointed. Of course, 10 years on, Google is promising even more – seamlessly streaming games at 4K and 60fps with HDR, integrating “play now” options into YouTube, and even loading a specific section of a game via a hyperlink, on any platform, in just five seconds.

“It’s actually closer to three seconds than five seconds,” Harrison told me the day after revealing Stadia on the Google stage at GDC. “But we thought, you know what, five seconds is actually, probably a good enough promise.”





That’s how much confidence Google executives have in Stadia. It’s due to launch later this year (with an unknown payment model), and there’s momentum behind the entire initiative from within and outside of Google.

Harrison is a 25-year veteran of the video game industry who held leading roles at both Sony and Microsoft, and Google picked him up in early 2018; Jade Raymond is the former head of Ubisoft Montreal and executive producer of the first Assassin’s Creed games, and Google recently hired her to lead its Stadia Games and Entertainment arm. The top game-engine companies, Unreal and Unity, are partnering with Google on Stadia, alongside dozens of other studios.

At launch, Google says Stadia will be able to stream any participating game to any device – including Chromecasts, smartphones, tablets, laptops and PCs – at up to 4K and 60fps, plus it’ll enable a handful of social and YouTube tricks.

“Our platform is capable of delivering all of the quality, all of the capability that we discussed, over conventional fixed, wired internet into your home,” Harrison said.





The problem I have with Harrison’s repeated assurance is that it relies on things Google has control over, like server hardware and distribution, and a special relationship that Google has with major ISPs. It doesn’t directly address the perpetual problem with game streaming: A lot of people have crappy internet.

No matter how powerful Google’s cloud infrastructure is, in-home and mobile connection speeds are a potential bottleneck that developers can’t R&D away. Harrison answered this critique as follows:

“Google’s been making investments in the fundamental fabric of the internet, the networking within our data centers, the way our data centers are connected, for 20 years. We’ve been a hardware company in the data center for longer than we’ve been a hardware company in Google Home or phones. That gives us some performance advantages in terms of the way the data reaches the ISP and how that data gets to you in your home. That allows us to deliver a very, very high-quality experience.”

Internet distribution has certainly expanded since OnLive and Gaikai tried to tackle low-latency streaming. Statista estimates 109.8 million homes in the US had a fixed broadband subscription in 2017, compared with 84.5 million in 2010. Internet speeds have steadily increased over the years as well, with the US clocking an average download rate of 96.25Mbps in late 2018, according to Ookla. (Stadia recommends a minimum of 25Mbps). Plus, Google’s big Project Stream beta in October went shockingly well. All of this is good for Google.

Engadget

And yet. 96Mbps may be the average internet speed across the US, but it certainly isn’t guaranteed anywhere. The fastest and most reliable internet-delivery system, fiber-optic, is not even available in 70 percent of the country, according to the FCC. Organizations from Microsoft to federal agencies and churches are working to fill in the gaps in rural internet access worldwide, but it’s a tricky problem for any one group to pin down. That includes Google, whose own efforts to establish a national fiber network have more or less dissolved, leaving a trail of useless silvery cables in cities across the country.

Google’s relationship with ISPs is clearly strong. It has a direct-peering relationship with companies like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Sprint, meaning these ISPs are plugged into Google servers, giving Google a clear line of data. Of course, BroadbandNow estimates there are more than 2,000 ISPs in the US, many of them small networks serving rural areas, and Google doesn’t have the same relationship with all of them. In these cases, its data has to bounce its around just like everyone else’s.

“It’s the depth of the pairing relationships that we have with ISPs to bring Google data to the internet today,” Harrison said. “We’re able to build on top of that to build a very high-performing game experience streamed to players. Whereas other streaming services that have come before have had to go through that multi-hop scenario, we know what it takes to get to that high quality.”





There’s no doubt in my mind that Stadia, once it launches, will work. It will load games and they will be playable. However, OnLive technically worked for a lot of users, too. Hell, PlayStation Now exists today and it also functions, but it’s definitely not disrupting the established video game ecosystem.

What matters is how well Stadia will work – and, perhaps more importantly, how well players will expect it to work. If (rather, when) it takes 15 seconds for a link to load a video, or if a game stutters just enough to be annoying the entire way through, or if it cuts out at random times according to the whims of a wily internet connection, Stadia will likely be viewed as a failure, regardless of how far Google’s technology has truly come.

Google is promising incredible things. Aside from 4K, HDR and 60fps, and game loading times as short as three seconds (all from a link, no less), Google is already talking about one day streaming games in 8K and 120fps. Stadia’s technology is scalable and Google is building it to last. But, first, it has to start.

“We also know that we won’t reach everywhere in the world, day one,” Harrison said. “We’re not claiming that we will reach everywhere in the world. The internet connectivity continues to grow, continues to reach more and more people at higher and higher speeds every year. There are some technologies just a little bit over the horizon which we think will be impactful.”",,engadget-in-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Google is convinced it can get game streaming right,Post,,

Google is in a far better position than most as they have the data center infrastructure already in place with loads of hardware and software expertise on their payroll. The hardware side I see as a solved problem honestly. The encoders found on modern GPU's can leverage the frame buffer directly and also support various low latency encoding schemes (M-JPEG2000) if enough bandwidth is available. It is possible today to transmit 4K60 over Ethernet on a local LAN with less than a frame of latency. If you want any sort of quality at that resolution and refresh, 10 Gbit of bandwidth is a must. A 1 Gbit does invoke compression artifacts but the latency is roughly the same. Of course few have that bandwidth at home so some commodity streaming codec will need to be used. Hardware endecoders for H.265/H.265 exist but they tend to have some additional latency by the nature of the codec algorithm but possible to be around a frame. Also on the hardware end that can save some latency are recent GPU advances that permit it to write directly to another card in the same system. In particular, being able to write the result of the compression algorithm directly to the output packet buffer of a NIC. Again, this is about saving as much latency as possible irregardless of the gains. The piece of hardware improvement is on the networking side to leverage deterministic Ethernet. This gets guaranteed bandwidth and provides feed back between the end points of when to expect the data to arrive. Google's own data center switches likely support these features already but they are are starting to be deployed for backbone and exchanges. Once home users upgrade their own equipment, end-to-end support here can greatly assist in various predictive and pre-emptive algorithms for gaming. With bandwidth guaranteed, latency bounded with known min/max, overall quality will improve. This can't perform miracles, but it does make services like this more feasible. Of course this going beyond Google's own data centers is going to be a challenge as ISPs are notorious for not improving their own infrastructure. One other facet I see Google pushing are some local receiver tricks, mainly variable rate refresh. A high VRR display can update as soon as a frame is received, cutting off a fraction of latency in the pipeline. Every little bit here helps. Some processing could be done locally, in particular audio and overlays. Google just needs to capitalize on what they could be doing. ====================::==================== PSNow seems to work too but they all are a little chuggy.

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently quoted saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console.",,Vichy360,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Click to expand... Well, here comes the future. This is just Google's version of this technology: Shadow Tech = PC Gaming on anything, GAME CHANGER Great for single player gaming. Casual phone gamers is definitely the prime market. I've been predicting since 2015 that Google and Apple would splash into the console gaming market with their HTPC products (ex. Apple TV). They've been ready for a while. They just needed first party support thrown behind a dual-analog controller. Was waiting on Google to release their own version of the NVIDIA Shield. Looks like they're bypassing that strategy to make it so people don't have to buy any separate device at all, and can run it on their phones, or low-end Android devices. Yeah, smart. Didn't see that leapfrog. Won't be adequate for competitive multiplayer due to light speed limitations (too much microlag). Don't fall for cloud computing power boasts. Who cares? You're limited by your stream bandwidth. I'm going to operate on the assumption that 484 GB /s is a typo, and that is meant to say Gb /s. Either way it doesn't matter because they're just pimping connections that don't exist outside of places like Google labs, universities, or the most highly-funded science orgs. In 2018 the average USA internet speed was 96 Mb/s . Keep in mind that doesn't tell you your lows, and that's if you have your connection to yourself. If you have the connection all to yourself, too. If shared in a home with a lot of family members on multiple devices there will be leeching. I mean, it's just laughable figure. It's only about 200x as fast as the current fastest NVMe drives in existence can transfer data. I'm not wasting time checking figures and crunching numbers, but I doubt even the Intel Xeon W-3175X CPU can compute data that quickly. It can't just be on their end. To speak figuratively, that's not how telephones work. Madmick said: ↑ But...apart from intolerable latency to competitive multiplayer the biggest drawback is still nerfed graphics. Those internet users fortunate enough to have the best internet connections see a ceiling compression package delivery via Shadow of 50 Mbps-70 Mbps (Mega bits ), he says. This takes your PC-caliber graphics to Twitch-caliber streaming. After all, for [email protected] , your PC requires a transfer of 2389 Mbps to express every single pixel. Not even Gigabit internet is sufficient. Furthermore, despite that this streamed data is a coded compression, designed to be decoded and unpacked in real-time via hardware acceleration by the ""Shadow Ghost"" box on your end, there isn't a chance in hell that you're closing that gap, and besides, decoding itself operates on an imprecise dynamic strategy in order to look as close to the uncompressed source as possible (like mp4 and ac3 rips online for video/music). This is also merely 1080p at 144fps. Click to expand... Of course, the above means that [email protected] , today's most demanding standard, requires 9555 Mb/s in order to push through 100% of the pixels with perfect fidelity. In other words, big picture gents, we're about to enter an internet-limited age for video games. This just makes too much sense for the major corporations as businesses. They can control all their software, ravaging piracy, deliver a viable product for cheaper, and increase their market by an enormous amount. It will be similar to Netflix/YouTube streaming in its youth, and still to this day. Get ready for graphics to regress, and quite steeply, using these services, for a temporary period. Blu-Ray is still far superior to these in terms of raw image, but the compression algorithms (i.e. mp4 video, mp3/aac/opus audio) and people's internet speeds have caught up to the point that in 2019 that few care unless they have a gigantic 4K OLED TV that they really want to make pop for guests. But it was pretty rough there in the late 2000's. Just look at the old fight vids that pop up in the Street Coliseum. There will be a hazing period for this technology, I think, but it won't be so bad, because on the user end, we've already reached these minimums that the human eye finds more tolerable.",,Madmick,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Google Stadia | Page 3,,,

Why the Future of Gaming Might Mean the End of Consoles





This article comes from Den of Geek UK. 

Just over a month ago, Sony’s PlayStation boss Shawn Layden suggested that the future of gaming could be “kind of a post-console world where you can have quality gaming experiences across a variety of technologies.” 

“Sure, PS4 and PS4 Pro provide what, of course, we think is the best gaming experience,” he added, “but the other consoles out there, be it [Nintendo] Switch, Xbox One X, or tablets, or phones – there are great experiences across all these. What we need to do is recognize all that. We’re not little gaming ghettos that are not federated or aligned at all. We’re all part of the same gaming community, we just come at it through different doorways. I think the future will be an extension of that metaphor. Your platform is not your hideaway. It’s just your doorway to all these other gamer folk.” 

In the month since Layden made that statement, a lot of evidence has emerged that seems to back up his claims that the lines might be blurring between PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox. Let’s have a look at the clues, then, and ponder what this post-console world could look like for the gamers and companies involved… 

More sharing between companies



Game companies are becoming more open to sharing their content than they were in the past. Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s Xbox boss, has provided a perfect example of this sharing-friendly new way of thinking. 

“We want to bring [Xbox] Game Pass to any device that somebody wants to play on,” Spencer told Geekwire in an interview, referring to the streaming service where gamers can pay a monthly fee to access an impressive library of Xbox 360 and Xbox One games. 

The service was originally only available on Xbox One, but rumors suggest that it could soon launch on Nintendo Switch. If Spencer really wants the service to appear on “any device that somebody wants to play on,” it seems safe to assume that the possibility of bringing the service to PlayStation consoles, mobile devices, and PC has at least been discussed at Microsoft. In fact, through the Play Anywhere initiative, there are already a select number of Xbox Game Pass games that you can play on Windows 10 PCs. 

Microsoft has also revealed that Xbox Live support is coming to mobile devices and there are rumors that the service might also appear on the Nintendo Switch, giving players access to achievements, their friends list, and Gamerscore on devices beyond the Xbox One. Developers will also be able to implement Xbox Live support into their games.  

The company has also just launched an update to its Wireless Display app that allows users to stream their PCs through an Xbox One. While this isn’t exactly a partnership between Xbox and PC platforms like Steam, this update has opened the door to streaming Steam games on Xbox One. What is a surprising partnership is Microsoft putting the PC port of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam. That’s a major step for Microsoft, which is hoping its flagship franchise to PC for the first time in more than a decade.  

Meanwhile, Sony’s own streaming service – PlayStation Now – already allows users to stream a library of PS2, PS3, and PS4 games on PC. The boundaries between the games you own and where you can play them seem to be gradually crumbling in a way that would have been difficult to imagine a few years ago. 

The end of the exclusive?



Although you do still see games companies producing exclusive titles (see: Marvel’s Spider-Man, God of War, Crackdown 3, Pokémon Sword and Shield), real progress has been made by Nintendo and Microsoft to bring their first-party titles to other platforms. While the latter company’s cross-platform endeavors have mostly entailed bringing its Xbox exclusives to Windows, another one of its platforms, the Japanese game publisher has truly made the leap. 

The Big N has already brought Pokemon, Super Mario, Fire Emblem, and Animal Crossing to mobile devices, and a new Mario Kart mobile game is also on the way. Bringing Nintendo properties to mobile in new and interesting ways (see: Pokemon Go) has opened new doors for the company, as it attempts to reach a whole new casual audience. 

Going forward, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched to imagine a world where exclusive games don’t stay exclusive forever and a time when a vast amount of older titles will be made available on devices that they didn’t originally launch on.  



Streaming games instead of sitting down with your console



Streaming, it seems, is the next great frontier for games companies. Whether you’re logging into PlayStation Now or Xbox Game Pass on a non-console device, playing PC games through your Xbox One, or remotely controlling your console from your phone (which is also something you can do right now in a lot of cases), the magic of the internet and online streaming is allowing games to bridge to gap between the systems they were made for and the ones that people currently have on hand. 

At the moment, there are limits on the sort of game that you can stream without encountering massive lag or breaking the internet. Older titles and smaller titles can work really well when streamed, but massive AAA games don’t always translate through the internet in the same way. But you can be sure that brainboxes are working behind the scenes to remedy that.  

Microsoft is working on an ominous-sounding initiative entitled Project xCloud, for example, which has the aim of creating a cloud-based streaming platform that can process huge games such as Halo without the need for a physical console in the room. Nobody seems to mind that hefty home consoles could go the way of the dodo as a result. 

“That is not where you make money,” Microsoft’s Phil Spencer said, on the topic of console sales, in that same Geekwire interview. “The business inside of games is really selling games […] So if you open it up, the more often people can play, the more they’re enjoying the art form. It increases the size of the business.” 

If the nut of lag-free streaming for major new games can be cracked, we could hypothetically live in a world where you don’t need to be anywhere near a console (or perhaps you won’t even need to own one at all) in order to play a new title. If your internet connection was strong enough, you could just log into your games membership thingy on whatever device you have handy and start playing from where you left off. 

Of course, there will always be situations when you’d rather play a game offline, so here’s hoping that the rise of game streaming doesn’t make the ability to download games a thing of the past. We can definitely see the physical disc going that way, though. 

Gaming on the go



In the same way that having Netflix on numerous devices has revolutionized the way we watch TV – allowing us to dip in and out of a binge whenever we get a spare minute – the possibility of fully functional AAA streaming and a greater amount of content-sharing between companies could mean that the way we play games majorly evolves in the next few years. 

Imagine a world where you can play the same game on your home TV, your phone, your laptop, or your tablet. As long as you have a strong enough internet connection, you could hypothetically stream that game anywhere. The flexibility of the Nintendo Switch – which allows you to play at home or on the god – could one day apply to all gaming.  

Many companies seem to be interested in game streaming and content sharing, both of which suggest a world where you don’t need to be with your home console in order to play home-console-sized games. This will be music to the ears of people who struggle to find the hours to play at home but would love to fire up an exciting new title when they’re away. Also, if the boundaries properly come down between devices and companies, gaming could start to seem like a less complicated pastime for newcomers to get involved with. 

What’s interesting, though, is that Sony and Microsoft are both developing next-generation consoles, despite all their interest in these new frontiers. It’ll be interesting to see how the PS5 and the Xbox Two (or whatever they end up being called) factor into these big ideas about how gaming can evolve… Are these next consoles the last ones we’ll ever have to buy? We’ll just have to wait and see to find out, but it is an interesting future to imagine.",,antimatterprince,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Why the Future of Gaming Might Mean the End of Consoles,Post,,

At least with the current platform such as PSN, Steam and other online game stores you get to download a full game locally into your PC/Console. Not to mention, you need quite a high requirement for broadband speed which is no problem in EU/US but for our country, it's laughable. Also, it will be tough to preserve the games on cloud when the time comes, unlike what we able to do now with old-gen and current gen games. psnow allows both streaming and download to hdd, nothing new there",,ziniowong,Malaysia,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » I haven't tried a game streaming service, so I'm kind of curious about the latency and speed of light issues that people were talking about. Is it something that makes tons of games simply unplayable for anyone who's ever gone into a settings menu, or does the latency just mean that you maybe don't get a good experience with the twitchiest games, like competitive shooters and fighting games? Armchair seemed to suggest that this would mostly only be useful for turn based games, but people indicated they were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey well enough, and it seems like PSNow has been doing it since 2014. Are streamed games just garbage to play over PSNow, or is it not as bad as all that? I played AC:O on Stream and it worked really well. I was using 100mbps wired Fios. I went in there specifically to test the latency and I'd say it matched my expectations of what a best-case scenario looks like for the tech. i.e. if you watch the screen closely as you press a button on the controller you'll definitely see it, and it's not my preference to sacrifice any input latency, but I could easily play the game that way and get used to it. A lamen player who isn't technical enough to be looking for latency probably would not notice it. That's on a controller though, using mouselook I really didn't like it. Even a casual player might notice the difference there compared to moving a mouse cursor on their computer. As I said before, KBAM is just objectively more precise than controllers can be. It's not a value judgement or a preference call when I say ""objectively more precise."" Think directional movements. With a keyboard, it's all or nothing. On or off. Controllers have far more granularity in left stick control than WASD, and it's there that you can get away with slightly slower control response because people just don't switch finger positions, they're moving a stick over a plane which can take time. Right stick controls are way less precise than a mouse. A mouse has a huge surface area it can move and nearly infinite different speeds, utilizing your entire arm for the movement, whereas sticks are just kind of a general thing that makes use of acceleration. Combine the two and input lag is fundamentally going to be more noticeable. Sure, I do agree that KB+M is incompatible with streaming except for the most casual of players. It would work okay for cursor-driven games with a client-rendered cursor, like RTSes, but that's about it. That said, KB+M is a dying breed - the only players who prefer that over a controller are the ones buying gaming PCs. So that doesn't worry me for the success of these services. Gaming PCs are resurging in recent years thanks to Twitch. It's not a dying breed, KBAM is on the rise if anything. It's what all the pros are using. Mechanical keyboards and excellent gaming mice are also coming out faster than I can keep track. jungleroomx on March 26",,jungleroomx,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,[Google Stadia] Stream all your games anywhere! - Page 16,,,

[a href=""https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-may-step-into-gaming-with-yeti-streaming-service""]More than a year ago[/a], The Information first reported about Google’s Project Yeti, the codename for an internal division responsible for building a next-generation streaming service similar to existing but limited options like Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now.[br][br]Even before Sony and Nvidia’s services existed, cloud gaming had been a bit like the industry’s holy grail: a just-out-of-reach ideal that has preoccupied a number of startups like OnLive, Gaikai, and others, but that’s never been cracked because the infrastructure and economics haven’t been properly worked out.[br][br]CLOUD GAMING HAS BEEN THE INDUSTRY’S HOLY GRAIL FOR YEARS[br][br]The concept is relatively simple. What if, like Netflix and Spotify, you could not only digitally distribute games, but also stream them over the internet, so players wouldn’t need expensive hardware to play graphically-intensive titles? It’s difficult because games, unlike other forms of media, are both incredibly large in size and require real-time input from players. But it is doable, by wiring up the necessary hardware in a data center, running the game on a remote machine, and sending the video and receiving player commands over the internet.[br][br]Regardless, it’s been impressive how many additional companies have revealed cloud gaming services in the past few years, turning what was once a niche experimental effort in an industry-wide race to figure out the future. Microsoft has [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263405/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-demo-video""]gone public with its own game streaming platform[/a], xCloud, that it plans to start testing later this year. EA, after acquiring the rental and cloud gaming service GameFly, is [a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/eas-project-atlas-wants-your-gaming-to-run-on-cloud-computing-and-ai/""]now working on a product of its own called Project Atlas[/a]. Even Verizon is getting into the game, with a [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179048/verizon-gaming-video-game-streaming-service-vzg-nvidia-shield-android""]test service up and running on Nvidia Shield set-top boxes[/a]. Earlier this week, [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265818/valve-steam-link-anywhere-personal-cloud-service-gaming-pc-gdc-2019""]Valve expanded its Steam Link service[/a] to turn it into a personal cloud gaming app. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177253/amazon-cloud-gaming-service-rumor-job-posting""]Both Amazon and Nintendo[/a]are looking into the technology, too.[br][br]There’s been a number of obvious signs that Google is indeed working on cloud gaming. Most prominently, Google [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17924492/google-project-stream-game-assassins-creed-odyssey-free-testing""]launched its public test of Project Stream[/a], an experimental game streaming technology that worked directly in its Chrome browser. Through a partnership with Ubisoft, Google let you play the brand-new Assassin’s Creed Odyssey — without needing to purchase the game — on pretty much any machine, given you had a strong enough internet connection.[br][br]GOOGLE’S PROJECT STREAM TEST IS AN OBVIOUS SIGN OF WHAT’S TO COME[br][br]It was a remarkable experiment, not [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950998/google-project-stream-gaming-assasins-creed-odyssey-first-impression""]just because it actually worked quite well[/a], but also because a game studio as large as Ubisoft agreed to let one of its biggest launches of the year be a test subject. The test is now over, but Google [a href=""https://blog.google/technology/developers/pushing-limits-streaming-technology/""]set out to gather data[/a] from what it considered a “technical test to solve some of the biggest challenges of streaming,” data that could help inform whatever product it announces next week.[br][br]There’s also been a lot of strategic hires in the past 18 months or so that hint toward a large, legitimate push into the gaming sector. Phil Harrison, a long-time executive of both Sony and Microsoft’s Xbox team, [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/22/16921214/phil-harrison-google-games""]joined Google last year[/a] as a general manager and vice president, but working in an disclosed capacity. At the time, it was believed Harrison was going to help Google build out its virtual and augmented reality platforms as viable gaming businesses. But Harrison was also on the board of game streaming company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/16/4442372/inside-gaikai-how-to-make-cloud-gaming-as-easy-as-watching-youtube""]Gaikai[/a], a company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4010420/sonys-playstation-4-will-use-gaikai-game-streaming-technology""]acquired by Sony in 2012[/a] and instrumental to the launch of its PlayStation Now service. So it’s likely Harrison is helping Google in its similar efforts.[br][br]Later in the year, [a href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1564647&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjackbuser%2F""]Google hired Jack Buser[/a], who was a senior director at Sony’s game streaming unit and led the PlayStation platform’s social efforts before that. Shortly after, Google [a href=""https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/30/google-hires-sonys-playstation-vr-guru-and-magic-lab-head-richard-marks/""]also hired Sony senior research engineer Richard Marks[/a], who helped build the PlayStation VR headset and Move controller.[br][br]And just last week, gaming industry veteran Jade Raymond [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/13/18263911/jade-raymond-google-vp""]also joined Google as a vice president[/a], though we don’t what team or division she’ll be leading. The timing may not be coincidental. Raymond, who was executive producer and co-creator of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed and later joined Electronic Arts, could be heading up some type of creative division at Google, or one responsible for developer outreach given her connections at big studios and publishers.[br][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][br][br]Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge[br][br] There’s a hardware component, and it may involve Chromecast [br][br]We don’t have too much to go on regarding what this service might look like, but we do know that there’s a strong likelihood there is custom Google hardware involved. Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware and its senior vice president of devices, tweeted out a link to the GDC keynote earlier this week:[br][br]Osterloh oversees Pixel phones, Google Home devices, and the myriad other hardware products the search giant now produces in-house. Whether that means we’re getting a Pixel-branded cloud gaming console or something else entirely is unclear. But it’s interesting nonetheless to see Osterloh involved in some way. [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]Kotaku[/a] [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]’s Jason Schreier[/a], who corroborated many of the initial details about Google’s upcoming service last summer, also reported that hardware will be one of three big components to the service, the other two being streaming and a massive in-house developer division that sounds very much like what Raymond could be involved in.[br][br]If we had to speculate on what exactly a Google game-streaming platform look like, we don’t have to look too hard. That’s because it could very well already exist, at least in part, as Chromecast. Google’s streaming dongle is already capable of letting you play Android games on your TV using screen mirroring from a compatible smartphone.[br][br]Now, that’s not to say that this new game streaming platform will just piggyback off Chromecast. But Chromecast does provide a model for how Google might go about delivering gaming experiences to a TV. For one, it’s a no-frills package that plugs in through one port and stays out of the way. And because cloud gaming, like media streaming, doesn’t require a ton of local processing power, the hardware can be lightweight and cheap. Given the amount of buzz Google is creating here though, it seems more likely it’ll drop all-new hardware specifically for gaming.[br][br] There could be a game controller to go with it [br][br]You can’t have console-quality gaming (if that is indeed what Google is going for) without some type of peripheral. For Google, that means building your own controller. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257911/google-patent-game-controller-project-stream-streaming-service-render""]According to a patent revealed late last week[/a], that might be exactly what the company has done, with images showing off a Google-branded gamepad that like a cross between a PlayStation controller and the [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]ill-fated[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] [/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]Ouya’s[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] gamepad[/a] from a half-decade ago.[br][br][br][br][br][br][br]Image: Google[br][br]This, even if Google doesn’t produce an actual console, might be why Osterloh’s hardware division is involved. For one, if Microsoft and Sony are building competing services, Google might not want its customers using other companies’ controllers.[br][br]And it’s a no-brainer that a service of this type would need to be first-and-foremost a controller-centric experience. As it stands right now, any kind of cloud gaming service is probably going to have at least some issues with connectivity. The bar for console game performance is much lower than on PC, where competitive games require the best connections possible and even milliseconds of latency matter to hardcore players.[br][br]In other words, this probably isn’t going to launch as a mouse-and-keyboard experience, at least not at first. So while we might not get Fortnite , Apex Legends , or Dota 2 on Google’s platform, there’s a good chance this service could very well be a place to play big-budget, single-player games like Assassin’s Creed .[br][br] ====================::==================== Thanks for the info",,solomon Mogire,France,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,Everything we think we know about Google’s mystery gaming announcement,,,

d097e47f-611e-4faf-9df5-813c21015cbb,3/21/2019,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/b3xm8e/google_stadia_gaming/#,"**Google introduced a new video game service** on Tuesday that allows people to play high-definition games instantly over the internet, joining an industrywide experiment to offer a so-called Netflix of gaming. The new service, called Stadia, will work for anyone with a fast internet connection and a computer, phone or tablet. The service will also work with Google’s Chromecast, an inexpensive dongle that plugs into television sets to stream videos. Google said Stadia would be released later this year, but did not announce a price. By focusing on streaming games — titles that are pulled from servers instead of downloaded to the customer’s device — Google is trying to catch the next wave of gaming. The premise: users pay a subscription to access a library of games that they can immediately play, as opposed to the traditional model of paying for a disc or waiting to download a game. There are pros and cons to each approach. The streaming model lets people try lots of games until they find some they enjoy, but the games tend to be superficial with rougher graphics. Downloaded games typically have more polished graphics, but they can take time to install and require a sizable one-time payment. Console makers having been pushing into streaming services. Sony offers a monthly subscription to a service called PlayStation Now with hundreds of titles, while Microsoft said it planned to offer a trial service later this year to stream games to Xbox consoles, computers and mobile devices. But video games still present a significant technical challenge compared with streaming a song or movie because of the amount of data involved and the unpredictability of game play. So the industry has continued to largely revolve around the releases of new game machines from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. https://i.redd.it/dgmteolc3kn21.jpg",,Dorang7,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,penn65000,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

183571142389,3/19/2019,http://asadiwebnet.tumblr.com/post/183571142389,"Google can earn a lot of money from video games, the best example being the profit from Google Play. However, the very creation of games and platforms associated with it - here the technological giant moves like an elephant in a porcelain store. Google Stadia is theoretically a great solution that will break into reality like water on rocks. 

 OnLive, PlayStation Now, Remote Play, Jump, GeForce NOW - what links all initiatives related to streaming games? Mainly that none of them was successful, what the producers counted on. Even giants like Sony and Nvidia did not offer the service at the appropriate level. Not because they could not. They could not do it. The biggest problem of streaming is not a company or server room. The user is the bottleneck of the service. Customer. Player. 

 Google Stadia is to provide a streaming FHD / 4k image at 60 frames per second. 

 Alphabet can use for this purpose the best server rooms, the most powerful units and the highest bandwidth. But what about these NAJ, if the player receives the picture via his own, not always ideal network infrastructure. Sure, people with a fiber optic led to the apartment will play in relatively comfortable conditions (for the impressions from natural, native 1080p, however, do not count). But what about all those that Vectra and UPC did not reach? 



 The network infrastructure of each country is a mixture of fiber optics, copper cables, radio waves and white spots. In the very center of Warsaw there are still places where you can not count on a faster connection than 10 Mbps. Some families are doomed to radio or LTE. In terms of access to the network, Poland is still one of the leaders. Where the cable infrastructure was laid earlier, today it is in an archaic state. Whoever tried to order a technician from the Internet in Rome knows exactly what I am writing about. 

 Google Stadia depends on what local providers of telecommunications services have to offer. The best server seems to be useless when there is a network with a considerable delay or insufficient transmission at home. This is a problem that no technology company has ever dealt with. Many great compression methods have been created for the streamed image, but none of them are confusingly similar to the native FHD standard. What to write about 4K. Small screens of smartphones and tablets slightly lose these streaming imperfections, but Google wants to run the Smart TV stage after all! 

 Google Stadia is the preview of the new gaming platform … without games. 

 To convince someone to buy a product or service, you need to have something original. Something your own. Something that competitors can not boast about. Sony knows that by creating exclusive games for PlayStation. Nintendo knows it, nurturing its own brands. Netflix knows it and knows HBO GO, producing their own movies and series. It also knows Spotify, fighting for temporary release discs. Google Stadia is proof that Alphabet still does not understand. 



 During the GDC 2019 conference, we learned that Google had just set up the first studio to produce video games. Not bad. It’s just that Sony has a dozen or so of them. Microsoft likewise. Considering that the average video game production cycle lasts 3 to 5 years, the first exclusive game for Google will debut … somewhere in 2021? In spite of this Stadia debuts already in 2019. If the Alphabet does not secure the premiere of several titles for temporary exclusivity thanks to sacks with money (or rather will not secure), it will look pale. 

 I really understand that exclusive games will not be the main strength of the new solution. I know that it is about universality and accessibility. A beautiful thing. Jump into the virtual world where your beloved streamer is located is the opportunity on which Google wants to build the popularity and uniqueness of the Stadia. The problem is that most streamers … broadcast on a competitive Twitch. YouTube Gaming, what would not be talking about this section, did not achieve such success as Twitch and it will not appeal again. 

 Sure, on YT also creates the mass of popular person. However, their materials usually produce complexes from A to Z. Deprived of live interaction. No possibility to play together with an online idol. As a result, Google Stadia loses much of its magic and attractiveness. You can write here - okay, but you’ll see a trailer for a new, hot YouTube hit and tick, you’re moving in 5 seconds to the game . - The problem is that: 

 *  trailers usually appear before the premiere of the game, so I will not launch any program because it has not been released yet. 
 *  publishers will probably first sell games traditionally, and only later will grant Google licenses. If so, I will go to the store because I do not want to wait. 
 Google Stadia is a beautiful vision. Just like Google+, Allo, Inbox and Glass OS. 

 I accept betting on when the Alphabet will obey. 2021? 2022? Probably not earlier. First, the giant will fight a bit. It will lower the price of the subscription. Will distribute free trial periods. But what about the free trial for the person that YouTube automatically starts with 720p? What about a subscription promotion for a player who connects to the Internet via an unreliable radio network? Google Stadia is a service that can be the best in the world. However, even this will not make the link in my apartment magically better, and the streamed FHD will look like native 1080p.

Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service.

In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included.

Essentially, Apple proposes you pay a monthly subscription to get unlimited access to paid titles on the App Store. Partners include Sega, Konami, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more.

Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft’s xCloud, Apple’s service is not cloud-based.

Google ended the speculation Tuesday by unveiling Stadia , a cloud-based service that could change the way users playing video games, as players would be able to access the service from computers, televisions or mobile devices. To highlight this, Google’s Majd Bakar demoed Stadia onstage with gameplay starting on a Chromebook, moving to a Pixel phone, then a PC and ending on a TV with Chromecast. As the game switched across devices, gameplay picked up from right where the previous device left off. Stadia will also be able to stream games at 60 frames per second in 4K resolution with HDR (high-dynamic range). To highlight this, Google demoed ""Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey"" and the upcoming ""Doom Eternal,"" both of which offered state-of-the-art graphics. The consumer advantage? Users won’t have to spend an exorbitant fee on a powerful PC or high-end console in order to enjoy games at their visual peak. This is a timely announcement given that the industry has been moving towards more of a digitally driven platform in recent years. Recent sales numbers out of the U.K. with ""The Division 2, "" for example, are indicative of that shift. There's also the growth of PlayStation Now and Xbox Game Pass, which offers hundreds of games to stream in a model similar to Netflix. While the Stadia doesn’t have a solid release date, it is expected to become available sometime in 2019. Google announced its new gaming platform, the Stadia.

Google Stadia puts Xbox One, PlayStation 4 on notice





Google CEO Sundar Pichai announces Stadia.

For years, we played video games in arcades. Then we huddled in front of specialized consoles hooked up to our living room televisions. The most dedicated of us built our own expensive PCs for the best experience.

Google is hoping to push another big change in gaming.

On Tuesday, Google announced Stadia, a service that lets you play games by way of a wide variety of devices and an internet connection, similar to how you watch shows and movies on Netflix.

 Google rolls out Stadia gaming service and controller 

3:53


The selling point for Stadia is convenience: You don’t need a chunky game console or expensive PC. Just a TV, set-top box, browser, phone or low-end PC that can surf the web using Google’s Chrome browser. You can use your own keyboard, mouse and a controller you have lying around, or you can use a specialized controller from Google that connects to its service over Wi-Fi.



Google’s promise for Stadia.


 James Martin/CNET


“Our ambition is far beyond a single game,” said Google’s Phil Harrison. Instead, the company sees the opportunity to give players “instant access” to a game by clicking a link. “The power of instant access is magical, and it’s already transformed the music and movie industries.”

The project will launch in the US, Canada, the UK and Europe in 2019. Google didn’t say how much games will cost to play, though it plans to say more in the summer.

Google sees gaming as a new way to seep into your life — as if email, search, YouTube and its Android software aren’t enough — through the promise of massive convenience. Who needs to spend hundreds of dollars on Microsoft’s Xbox One, Sony’s PlayStation 4, Nintendo’s Switch or a PC when you can just play a game over the internet on a scrawny laptop?

Though Google isn’t the first company to offer game streaming, its entry into the space could make waves within the video game world. Google has lots of money, and it’s made its name by offering reliable services like Gmail, Google Maps and Google Photos for free or on the cheap.

With Google’s streaming service you’ll no longer have to go to a retailer like Amazon, Best Buy or GameStop to get the latest title. Nor will you have to potentially wait hours to download it from online stores like Valve’s Steam. Instead, Google says, all you’ll need is a fast internet connection and a controller, and you’re set.

“Google has a lot going for it,” wrote IHS analyst Piers Harding-Rolls. He noted that between all of Google’s various services, it has a strong brand with consumers. The question, he said, is whether that can translate to the game world.

“Cloud is the new platform dynamic for the games sector and will be where the future competitive landscape resides,” he added. Google just needs to offer the right games to make it work.

A decade coming

I played my first streamed game about a decade ago, through a service run by a now-defunct startup called OnLive. Back then, the company offered to sell me access to hit games like the sci-fi shooting title Borderlands, playable through a PC, Mac or a little set-top box and a controller.

Just like with Netflix, all I had to do was log in, choose what I wanted to play and start. Sometimes the visuals would garble, just like they did back then with movie streaming too. But it worked. It felt like the future.

I’ve been waiting for that future ever since.

OnLive shut down in 2015, but other contenders have popped up. Sony launched its PlayStation Now streaming game service in 2014, as a complement to its popular PlayStation 4 game console. Microsoft and Electronic Arts, meanwhile, have said they’re developing competing services as well, though they haven’t offered firm launch dates. Even Comcast, the TV and internet provider, has dabbled in game streaming, most recently considering a purchase of the Korean game company Nexon, rumors say. 

All these companies are betting that the streaming approach will eventually upend the way we play video games, much in the same way Netflix did our movie watching a decade ago. The question is when.

“What’s good is in this industry you can play on mobile or PC, and now it’s starting to be the same game,” said Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, who’s been working with Google on streaming game technology for six years. “It’s one more possibility to experience the worlds we create and it gives opportunities to creators to take full advantage of mobile.”

A new promise

Google pitched its service as a way to bring together different people in the game industry, including players, streamers and coders. The company said it’s developed ways for people to start playing a game after clicking a link in YouTube, for example. 

Google has also partnered with game developers like Epic Games and Unity. As a result, Google’s high-performance servers will stream games at up to 4K ultrahigh-definition video at 60 frames per second, meaning animations should move smoothly. 

Already, Google said, Stadia is able to deliver games with more performance than Microsoft’s Xbox One X and Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro combined. And Google said it eventually expects to double that performance as game developers create even more complex games.

Google won’t rely just on other game makers though. The company said it’ll follow Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo in building its own specialized games for its service, through a studio called Stadia Games and Entertainment.

“We are on the brink of a huge revolution in gaming,” said Jade Raymond, head of Google’s game making group and an industry veteran.

For its part, Microsoft said in a statement that it’s “a great time to be a gamer,” and noted that it’s devoted to offering choice as well through its upcoming Project xCloud service. Sony and Nintendo didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In the meantime, Google said it plans to closely knit its game service with YouTube, offering new ways for people to compete and play with one another. That’s particularly exciting to Matthew Patrick, a popular YouTube gaming personality known as MatPat.

“It unites technology and entertainment in ways we’ve never seen before,” he said.

I have recently bought the VR and I am totally amazed with its potential, just a few topics and questions. 1. I am a big CoD fan and love the game play, do you think developers will be focusing on VR game play in the future to make the game play even more realistic? 2. Movies, I have watched a few films with the system on, but as Microsoft have some films in 360 mode, do you think Sony will use the VR to more potential? 3. App development, as every mobile phone has a camera, could an app be developed so that we can look at our 3d photo's and movies in VR? If some of this questions have already been answered then I can only apologise and as mentioned I am new to the PS4 and the VR.

In other words, games that normally run like dogshit will run like dogshit with some lag on PSNow. The degree of lag has to do with your latency to the PSNow servers, while visual quality is determined by internet speed. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about this; upgrading your internet connection might help with lag, but ISPs usually advertise maximum speeds, not latency. The PS2 library is tiny because they just started adding PS2 games a few months ago. They haven't had the time to build the PS2 library the same way they have for PS3, (which has been around since the inception,) and PS4. I also think you're right about the amount of shovelware; does anyone really want Champion Jockey or Rugby 15? Some games just exist to pad the numbers.

Many people reporting on this also stated that companies like Nintendo are trying to go down this route in the future. And what was my reaction? I've hated the idea from the very beginning. Maybe it's something we will have to get used to, but I loathe the idea of not having my games nor my system in my possession. The fact that a data center is doing everything for me and I only own my controller and maybe a ""digital copy"" (i.e. a pass/subscription) to my gaming experience really bothers me. I mean, I'm the type of gamer who loves to have physical copies of my games, much like I have physical copies of my books. I want to be able to form a library as a collector and as someone who primarily games by myself. I also want to own my own hardware and hate the idea of needing to be connected to the internet when I'm gaming. Now, I can understand the positives of going cloud -- it increases the number of people who can conceivably play your games, removes the need to create hardware for every individual person, and removes the need for physical media. In other words, everything becomes cheaper to make and you have a larger consumer base (or so it seems). But will this really be the revolution of gaming for everyone? Netflix is doing well, sure, but watching movies and playing games are two totally different experiences. There is a massive difference between watching something and interacting with it, being immersed into it, and being a subculture. Can cloud based systems of the future really cater to the gaming world? Or is this yet another experiment that will fail miserably, because it really doesn't understand how gamers think, interact, and understand the world of their hobby? Let's discuss. ====================::==================== Who says Nintendo is going this route? There's google stadia, microsoft Xcloud, and Sony playstation NOW.. but there is no Nintendo streaming service. Even Nintendo's NES app is loading onto the 'harddrive' of your switch.. surely nes games can be streamed..

The first is really stupid and is a solved by expendable local storage. Even console makers figured that out. Even Nintendo knows, and has included SD-Card expansion since the Wii. The second is a bit more understandable. Especially if you don't want to release propertary Emulation code, which is what PlayStation Now mainly does. Or if that emulator takes more power than the local hardware could support. So what is Apple's plan with a Game Streaming? Are they looking to do #1 or #2? If #1 they are admitting they have a storage and installation of problem with large (high quality asset, possiblity VR) games. If #2 they are admitting their phones can't handle the processing load of higher end games, which wouldn't be surprising but since Apple still doesn't gaming as serious business.",,Dorje Sylas,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Apparantly twice the power of current consoles can be streamed, straight to any device. Im still very dubious about streaming, but a lot of people claiming it is the future (though, it must be said, most these claims seem to come from people involved with it) The big question mark is obviously pricing structure. I can't see a game like doom eternal being in a subscription, unless big bucks are changing hands. Will you own the game? Will you rent it? I suspect streaming could get big in Japan, but America and Europe will be much harder to make an impact in. And what of vr if consoles are on the way out? We haven't even got wireless vr, let alone streaming. ====================::==================== That's what psnow is tbf. @aaron9992000",,WinnieP michelle_tabor,Netherlands,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,Stadia,,,

I can only assume certain users have recently been committed to an institution and using their 1 hour of free internet access to make arguments that no one ever made. If someone can point to me where in this thread anyone said Sony was the first or best game streaming service maybe the user can finally stop arguing with that imaginary person in their heads.

In the last week, two of the world’s tech giants have made a big play for the attention – and wallets – of the world’s two billion gamers. Apple, already a big player in the video game market thanks to the iPhone and App Store, announced Apple Arcade, a subscription that will offer exclusive high-end games to be played on Macs, iPhones and iPads. And Google, a newcomer to video games, announced the subscription service Stadia, which will let players stream games to any screen from the cloud.

These moves towards a Netflix-style subscription approach present slightly different visions of how video games will be made and played. Google and Apple’s services will join Microsoft’s Xbox Games Pass and Sony’s PlayStation Now. Which company will dominate? And will these subscriptions complement the gaming industry’s current business model or eventually replace it?

The KOTOR (Knights of the Old Republic) series sounds like it fits your needs perfectly. I’m partial to 2 but that you do need to play 1 for 2 to make sense. Just be sure you find some popular bug fixing mods before you start them (1 isn’t too bad with bugs but the restored content mod is basically required to be able to progress normally in 2). If Star Wars isn’t your thing, I’ve heard good things about the villain in Borderlands 2 (haven’t played), or I would also recommend Detroit: Become Human when it releases on pc or through psnow or ps4 if you have one. Sony has released some great single player games in the past few years (Horizon: Zero Dawn, God of War, Spider-Man, and the upcoming Ghosts of Tsushima looks great too) so I would recommend finding a cheap ps4 deal if you enjoy good single player games and want to stay in more modern graphics.",,Fickle-Pickle_,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

183607187629,3/21/2019,http://drewb.tumblr.com/post/183607187629,"One of the biggest boom sectors globally in recent years is esports (electronic sports), which is predicted to become a billion-dollar industry in 2019. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, though, when you consider the video games industry is the richest entertainment form in the world, worth more than $116bn in 2018 according to a Reuters report. 

Online user experience is a key reason behind this demand, as there is a great sense of community in playing and watching multiplayer games like League of Legends or Fortnite online. Being able to login from anywhere, and connect with friends and people across the globe is a fun, empowering and exhilarating experience. 

Esports attracts professional players, dedicated amateurs, and huge viewing figures from fans on social platforms like Twitch and YouTube. Most importantly, it has caught the eye of investors and business leaders, who have transformed video gaming into a highly professional and well-structured competitive esports scene. 

Organisational bodies run tournaments and leagues around the world, with teams and players competing against one another for multimillion-dollar prizes. Gaming is suddenly big business – it’s been elevated to the level of major sporting events, with esports screened in an online arena where gaming professionals take to the stage with millions of people watching online.

Brand integration

Companies and celebrities are beginning to target the gaming industry, integrating both games and esports within business and marketing strategies. Louis Vuitton, for example, was one of the first trailblazers, using a character from Final Fantasy to model its SS16 collection back in 2015. Today’s groundbreaker, however, is electronic dance music producer Marshmello, who recently launched a live, 10-minute, in-game concert within Fortnite – one of the most popular games of the past year or so. Users could dance and interact using in-game emotes, and jump on stage right in front of Marshmello’s avatar, almost akin to an actual concert but 1337 style.

The rise of the gaming industry is opening up many unique opportunities for brands to get involved and tap into this growing economy. New research from Newzoo, global provider of games and esports analytics, estimates that esports revenues will reach $1.1 billion in 2019 (YoY growth of 26.7%) and sponsorship will generate $456.7 million (YoY growth of 34.3%). There is also a lot of freedom for cross-industry creativity with sponsorships and collaborations becoming increasingly common.

Nike and PlayStation, for example, used the original colourings of PlayStation’s first console and its iconic symbols (∆ x o □) to develop custom-made shoes named Nike PG 2.5 x PlayStation. Similarly, fighting game Tekken 7 released additional downloadable content to its roster that included a character from TV show The Walking Dead. Meanwhile, long-running animated comedy The Simpsons even covered esports in its recent episode with Homer as Bart’s coach.

Clearly the gaming industry is becoming a lot more attractive as it intersects the entertainment worlds of music, TV, fashion, and games, and is bringing people with similar interests together to bolster the reach for the companies in collaboration.

Growing audience

It’s not only the gaming revenues that are soaring though – the global esports’ audience is growing rapidly too. The total audience of occasional viewers and esports enthusiasts in 2017 was 355 million, according to Newzoo. In 2018 it rose to 395 million people, with year-on-year growth of 17.8%, but in 2019 is predicted to reach an audience of 454 million. Newzoo estimates that 57% of esports enthusiasts will come from Asia-Pacific region, with just 16% from the EU. This represents a huge opportunity for esports to grow its player base and audience in the EU, just like it already has done within APAC.

There’s no doubt that the esports community will continue to thrive and the gaming industry will keep on growing. With recent developments in cloud gaming (e.g. PlayStation Now, Xbox’s Project xCloud, and Nvidia’s GeForce Now), VR, and Google having just announced its own in-browser streaming games service to compete with PlayStation and Xbox, there’s even more room for esports and games to evolve. Even Snapchat is getting in on the act, having recently announced it will be launching a new gaming platform as early as next month. 

It’ll be interesting to see what’s next for the industry: will Hollywood stars tap into the cinematic aspects of games? Are gamers primed to become some of the world’s biggest influencers? Will we see a Nike-sponsored video games star? How far will cross-industry products go?

 We’ll keep a close eye on developments in coming months and see if it becomes a challenger to traditional social media platforms.

Source: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images
Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on Tuesday unveiled Stadia, its vision for the future of gaming.

Unlike many traditional gaming platforms, which require a powerful PC or dedicated console, Stadia streams games from Google’s data servers around the world to people’s computers, tablets, and smartphones. Players can also start playing on one of their devices and quickly resume on another device — a convenient feature for many consumers who tote around multiple gadgets.

But the Mountain View, California-based tech giant, which now has the full attention of gamers and press, also left several big questions about Stadia unanswered, pointed out Piper Jaffray analysts Michael J. Olson and Yung Kim in a note published Tuesday.

How much?

Google didn’t specify how much Stadia will cost when it launches sometime later this year or how the payment model would work exactly. Current game streaming services such as PlayStation Now, which lets PlayStation owners play select PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 titles, charge $19.99 a month and $99.99 a year for them to play as many of those titles as they want however frequently they want.

But Stadia is a different beast, with Google positioning its streaming platform as a cutting-edge rival to more traditional PC and console gaming. (Indeed, Google Vice President Phil Harrison made pointed comparisons between Stadia’s technical prowess and the less advanced technical capabilities of Sony’s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One X.) And Piper Jaffray cautions Google about giving Stadia a PlayStation Now a Netflix-like buffet-like pricing scheme.

“We believe game publishers may resist an all-you-can-play model, similar to video services such as Netflix,” Olson and Kim wrote in the note.

How do games actually play?

While Google showed brief snippets of different games, the company did not allow the press to have any hands-on time with the software. (They were able to handle Google’s newly announced controller, however.)

“Additionally, one of our larger remaining questions centers on multiplayer functionality,” pointed out Olson and Kim. “Multiplayer was discussed at length during the presentation, but the presentation lacked an actual display of this.”

Google may either hold another event later this year before Stadia’s launch to give reporters hands-on time, or worse, keep that part of Stadia under lock and key until launch time for press and gamers to review and discover on their own. That’s hardly ideal for a company that must shore up as much excitement as possible for its experimental new game streaming platform. After all, just because it’s a Google device or service doesn’t mean it’s destined to succeed. (We’re looking at you, Google+.)

Which games will be available at launch?

A game platform’s launch lives and dies based on the games that arrive alongside it, and that’s where Google was really light on details. The company did tease out three games, including “Doom Eternal,” another fast-paced shooter from developer Bethesda Softworks, Ubisoft’s “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey,” first released last October on other platforms, and an unknown title from Q-Games. But beyond that, Piper Jaffray noted that none of the major third-party publishers, with the exception of Ubisoft, were featured during Google’s presentation on Wednesday. That’s not to say the support isn’t there, but if it was, Google should have made a bigger deal of it.

As Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley pointed out on Tuesday, Google did announce a game studio of its own called Stadia Games and Entertainment, which Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond will run. That’s certainly a plus, because Stadia will need a lot of unique, original games to convince enough gamers the platform is worth paying for.

How’s that lag?

Stadia is hardly the first game streaming platform to come along, and it certainly won’t be the last. Equally as important as third-party software support is “latency:” the delay between a player’s button presses on a controller, mouse, or keyboard and when it registers onscreen.

“We believe the majority of console & PC style games will be streamed, with processing done in the cloud and the gamer only required to have some form of internet consumption device (and a controller),” Olson and Kim wrote, adding that they expect latency issues to be resolved within the next 10 years. “In the meantime, we expect full game download to be an intermediate step, while streaming gains traction. We anticipate multiple streaming platform providers will arise, along with limited direct distribution from some publishers.”

Those are words Google likely doesn’t want to hear, but whether Stadia has the chops and third-party support to prove otherwise remains to be seen.

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.

It is still awful compared to straight gaming on hardware.

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » I haven't tried a game streaming service, so I'm kind of curious about the latency and speed of light issues that people were talking about. Is it something that makes tons of games simply unplayable for anyone who's ever gone into a settings menu, or does the latency just mean that you maybe don't get a good experience with the twitchiest games, like competitive shooters and fighting games? Armchair seemed to suggest that this would mostly only be useful for turn based games, but people indicated they were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey well enough, and it seems like PSNow has been doing it since 2014. Are streamed games just garbage to play over PSNow, or is it not as bad as all that? I played AC:O on Stream and it worked really well. I was using 100mbps wired Fios. I went in there specifically to test the latency and I'd say it matched my expectations of what a best-case scenario looks like for the tech. i.e. if you watch the screen closely as you press a button on the controller you'll definitely see it, and it's not my preference to sacrifice any input latency, but I could easily play the game that way and get used to it. A lamen player who isn't technical enough to be looking for latency probably would not notice it. That's on a controller though, using mouselook I really didn't like it. Even a casual player might notice the difference there compared to moving a mouse cursor on their computer. As I said before, KBAM is just objectively more precise than controllers can be. It's not a value judgement or a preference call when I say ""objectively more precise."" Think directional movements. With a keyboard, it's all or nothing. On or off. Controllers have far more granularity in left stick control than WASD, and it's there that you can get away with slightly slower control response because people just don't switch finger positions, they're moving a stick over a plane which can take time. Right stick controls are way less precise than a mouse. A mouse has a huge surface area it can move and nearly infinite different speeds, utilizing your entire arm for the movement, whereas sticks are just kind of a general thing that makes use of acceleration. Combine the two and input lag is fundamentally going to be more noticeable. jungleroomx on March 26",,jungleroomx,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,[Google Stadia] Stream all your games anywhere! - Page 16,,,

Instead I think, right now they can trick me for an hour (or sometimes a few hours). Maybe soon it’s a few days. Then a few weeks. Then a few months.

We'll see! Hopefully! Quote: : » After watching the Google Stadia announcement I went back and read up some on what Microsoft was promising in 2013, https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/how-the-xbox-one-draws-more-processing-power-from-cloud-computing/ I'm starting to wonder if xCloud is actually their next platform. They could be fulfilling their original idea for the Xbox One, set back by the always online and DRM backlash, but given 6 extra years of development to improve it. Right now they've only been showing it off with Xbox One games, but what if their next Gen games can run fully or partially on xCloud? What if the Xbox One is forwards compatible with their next gen games, running them partially on the local hardware and partially using xCloud? They could still release a new stronger hardware that plays the games natively, or run games entirely in the cloud through an xCloud app on non-Xbox platforms. Imagine launching a next gen platform with millions of compatible hardware units already in consumers hands, and an upgrade option for those that want full native performance on those games. https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/3/15/17123452/microsoft-gaming-cloud-xbox-future https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/23/microsoft-is-building-low-cost-streaming-only-xbox-says-report/ This seems to lend support to my idea. Only thing missing is the Xbox One being potentially forwards compatible Presumably, it is part of the next platform, though it isn't ""the platform"" anymore than the backwards compatibility program is ""the platform"". There are too many people with too limited internet (on top of people with sufficiently capable internet, but service caps that are rampant in countries like the US) to exploit it properly at the current technological level (where Microsoft has described it, so far, as effectively an Xbox One S-powered server), much less the level that Microsoft will need to compete with Playstation 5 and PC advancements. This was always an issue with Gaikai/PSNow too--an interesting theory I've heard is that the whole point of PSNow was not as a replacement (pretty obvious, since it was never even capable of that for people with the best internet), but as a promotional tool: ""You've played this Playstation game on a whim, but in a very limited form. Why not commit to buying it in a much better form, i.e. non-streaming?"" Not by coincidence, Sony always leaned hard on the PS3 library for Gaikai--not only was this not easily emulated, most PS3 games are far less daunting than your average PS4 game in terms if visual fidelity (there are PS3 games in that library that look worse than their Xbox 360 counterpart, which is even older hardware). Google is probably the biggest internet technology company in the world, or very close to it. Google hasn't answered how the Stadia program will address those issues beyond the unspoken default ""It just won't work well, or at all, for millions of people."" They'll have to reconcile that at some point too, considering even their presentation of Assassin's Creed: Odyssey , on a tech floor (with absurdly good internet), technically managed to look worse than high-end consoles and have worse latency. Imagine how it'll look for someone with typical internet, and not whatever fiber connection Google was using at their own demonstration in front of thousands of developers. Imagine how much it'll cost the average consumer to have the minimum bandwidth necessary, as oppose to what they have? Microsoft has to figure this out as well. Of course, the current library model--that software will operate on earlier hardware, and not stream to it (not excluding that possibility)--may or may not allow for forwards compatibility. The-Cloud(tm) offers a novel solution to that problem. Of course, then Microsoft also has to sell new hardware to spur excitement, to attract third-party developers, and recoup the costs of 'Project Scarlet'. Streaming is potentially a really good accessory for that, if it works well, but not a good replacement. Netflix was supposed to kill all other forms of video consumption. It (or rather, media streaming in general) does dominate, but ironically, has long since added support (and actively encouraged) downloading video in advanced. And Netflix never had to contend with upload speed and latency (no one cares if Avengers: Infinity War has 300 ms lag, so long as the audio mostly matches up). It's exciting to speculate on, in any case. We could be a lot closer to an all-streaming standard, or something close to it (UHD films are selling slightly better than bluray discs did at the same point in their lifetime, thanks to a larger market worldwide), but the demand and promised video quality and low latency are rising much faster than internet service is improving for the targeted audience--and no one wants to tell people that things will need to suck so that streaming might succeed. Most people are playing Xbox One and PS4 on DSL-like connections that stutter with 1080p video. Google has been talking a really big game, way bigger than Microsoft--4K at 60hz ""to start"", and then 8K (7680x4320, or 16 times a 1080p screen) at 120 hz ""in the future"". The proposed 10 teraflop hardware will cost a few thousand dollars today , though obviously that price will (slowly) go down. But even that initial minimum would be incredibly daunting to stream at. Streaming to a switch, with its 720p 60 hz screen is a lot more realistic.

183554929770,3/18/2019,http://eduardobutton.tumblr.com/post/183554929770,"All day an ominous lull has been hanging over the video game industry. The Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) just started today and tends to offer some great insight into the creation of video games, both through retrospectives on already released games and new announcements. Google announced that it has something to show in a keynote tomorrow, and all of those rumors from last year about Google entering the video game scene suddenly start holding a lot of water.

But what could Google be showing? Are they releasing a console themselves? A streaming service? Will it be compatible with other console manufactures like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, or is Google entering as a competitor to further confuse the market? That’s the question swirling around everyone’s minds.

When a forward thinking tech giant like Google comes in to a very well established but growing industry, they aren’t just going for the status quo. They want to push the envelope. It’s doubtful that it will release a standard console, given Google’s history with networks and cloud infrastructure. So will they beat Microsoft to the punch on the “console as a service” design I talked about just last week? Will their hardware be a dongle like the Chromecast, or better yet, maybe just a controller that allows you to connect to whatever Google’s gaming service is? (Kotaku’s Jason Schreier seems to think there’s some weight to that theory.)



For us “gamers,” it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense for Google to jump into gaming. We already have our PS4s, Xbox Ones, Switches, and PCs, so why would we want another gaming option? Point is that it’s probably not actually for you, at least not directly. Google isn’t getting into gaming hoping to draw away the die hard Sony and Microsoft crowd. They aren’t going to try to directly compete to take people away from their current consoles. It’s going to be easy hardware and services for people that don’t usually game.

Let me be clear. Google gaming is not here to compete. It is here to innovate.

The Probable Popularity of Google Gaming

As much as gaming has been growing, Google is still far more of a household name than PlayStation or Xbox. So it’s much easier for them to capture an audience outside of the usual gaming market, especially if they make it easy. Let’s say that the controller theory rings true, and that it ends up being a cloud console powered entirely through a controller. The hardware required is relatively inexpensive, and the cost involved becomes the service itself. It’s near portable, allowing you to move it to any TV (depending on how exactly it hooks up, likely via an HDMI dongle transmitter), and you have instant access to a vast gaming library through some kind of service, whether it’s a Netflix for games or a digital storefront. I don’t foresee Google’s games solution to involve physical media in any way at all.

As much of an open platform as Google has in their mobile department, I don’t think we’ll see tomorrow’s announcement involve any compatibility with our current gaming setups. Sony is notoriously closed off from external services, trying to give more weight to their own services and subscriptions. Why get PlayStation Now when you could just get Google’s games service instead? Sony isn’t going to want direct competition right on their own console.



Truth is, Google has already been involved in gaming quite a bit, so this (whatever this is) makes sense as the next step for them. They’ve been snapping up talent from around the industry, and there’s no telling what video game veterans could do with Google’s financial backing, power, and broad think tank. There are people involved—such as Phil Harrison—who know this industry inside and out, and could use this opportunity to make a pretty big leap forward for the industry as a whole. A company known for its commitment to convenience and connectivity is not looking to compete. It’s looking to innovate and change the way that people think about “gaming.” It’s looking to make it more convenient, cheaper, and easier to get into. But can that convenience translate into a market share? And how does it impact what we see from the next generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles? Could Google be the brand that kills physical media in favor of a digital games future?

Of course, it’s all massive amounts of speculation until we learn what secrets they have been planning. One thing is certain, Google seems confident enough in their future in games that they’ve got an entire conference and keynote surrounding it. This isn’t just a small little side announcement. It’s very possible we could be seeing a pretty big turn for the gaming space come tomorrow.

Unlike Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, Sony doesn't have the cloud server network and infrastructure to offer their streaming services worldwide. That is why PSNow has such spotty coverage. Sony is going to have buy cloud coverage from others or invest a lot of money to set up the infrastructure to compete against those other 3 worldwide not only on consoles but also on PC, phones and tablets. With both Google and Amazon entering the fray along with MS. I dont see it being worth Sonys time to try and build infrastructure in countries where it doesnt have any. The other companies are going to have a couple of legs up on them there. Just concentrate on the successful hardware business and only worry about streaming in the wealthy countries where they already have infrastructure and broadband speeds and adoption rates support the technology. Software sales is where they make the most profit though. Hardware sales especially consoles don't really earn the manufacturers that much profit. I think they even incur a loss or close to one on every console they sell. It is the software that they sale on those consoles where they get most of their profit. That is why MS, Google and Amazon has decided to go after the larger mobile and PC market via live streaming where software sales combined dwarf what is available on consoles. https://www.sonymcs.com/ Nothing on this is related to their video game division though. It is sill incorrect to state Sony don't have a world wide cloud service capable or would need to buy cloud service from another company.

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » I haven't tried a game streaming service, so I'm kind of curious about the latency and speed of light issues that people were talking about. Is it something that makes tons of games simply unplayable for anyone who's ever gone into a settings menu, or does the latency just mean that you maybe don't get a good experience with the twitchiest games, like competitive shooters and fighting games? Armchair seemed to suggest that this would mostly only be useful for turn based games, but people indicated they were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey well enough, and it seems like PSNow has been doing it since 2014. Are streamed games just garbage to play over PSNow, or is it not as bad as all that? I played AC:O on Stream and it worked really well. I was using 100mbps wired Fios. I went in there specifically to test the latency and I'd say it matched my expectations of what a best-case scenario looks like for the tech. i.e. if you watch the screen closely as you press a button on the controller you'll definitely see it, and it's not my preference to sacrifice any input latency, but I could easily play the game that way and get used to it. A lamen player who isn't technical enough to be looking for latency probably would not notice it. That's on a controller though, using mouselook I really didn't like it. Even a casual player might notice the difference there compared to moving a mouse cursor on their computer. As I said before, KBAM is just objectively more precise than controllers can be. It's not a value judgement or a preference call when I say ""objectively more precise."" Think directional movements. With a keyboard, it's all or nothing. On or off. Controllers have far more granularity in left stick control than WASD, and it's there that you can get away with slightly slower control response because people just don't switch finger positions, they're moving a stick over a plane which can take time. Right stick controls are way less precise than a mouse. A mouse has a huge surface area it can move and nearly infinite different speeds, utilizing your entire arm for the movement, whereas sticks are just kind of a general thing that makes use of acceleration. Combine the two and input lag is fundamentally going to be more noticeable. Sure, I do agree that KB+M is incompatible with streaming except for the most casual of players. It would work okay for cursor-driven games with a client-rendered cursor, like RTSes, but that's about it. That said, KB+M is a dying breed - the only players who prefer that over a controller are the ones buying gaming PCs. So that doesn't worry me for the success of these services. Gaming PCs are resurging in recent years thanks to Twitch. It's not a dying breed, KBAM is on the rise if anything. It's what all the pros are using. Mechanical keyboards and excellent gaming mice are also coming out faster than I can keep track. Even the consoles are getting in on it. KB+M is quite the opposite of dying, not least as you can use it for document work or whatever when you ain't gaming. KB+M support on consoles is kind of an oddity, I would not say it's a rising trend. More of a thing for people who want to use their console on their desk as if it were a PC. Also anecdotally I think controller usage on PC has been on the rise for years compared to KB+M; increasingly more people are just switching to controllers full time because it's more comfortable and they can play in the living room. Shooters are becoming increasingly friendly towards controllers these days as they aim for crossplay like Fortnite. So you can expect to see more online shooters giving consideration for fairness by tweaking the auto-aim etc. Anyway I digress - yeah, PC gamers use KB+M for shooters more often than not. My point though is that those people aren't Stadia's audience - they have gaming PCs already, they have no use for streaming. Maybe in the future they could choose to switch to streaming rather than upgrade their PC, but if they do then they'll probably have to switch to using a controller. It's a rising trend given that, up until recently, it didn't exist at all on consoles. Developers were loathe to mix KBAM with controllers -- it seems like Fortnite kind of broke that wave, but consoles supporting keyboards for use in games period is new and as such, yeah I'd say it's on the rise. And, anecdotally, Sea of Thieves recently allowed XB1 players to opt out of playing with KBAM users due to the advantages they were giving up when PvPing against them, Fiatil on March 27",,Fiatil,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,[Google Stadia] Stream all your games anywhere! 16,,,

Nvidia has GeForce Now currently in beta. MS is going to announce their game streaming soon. Amazon supposedly has a project for game streaming. There are a few other companies doing this that aren't big names. Sony has PlayStation Now which is live. $20/mo or $100/yr.  Has 750 PS2, 3 and 4 games.  I tried their 7day trial and for the games I did play I could live with it. This can be played on a PS4 or PC. I find these services to be intriguing. I could see myself going away from consoles and not spending coin on hardware.  I need a new PC, so put that at say $1500 and I buy one next gen console I am at almost $2000.   Or I just just keep what I have and subscribe to a couple of these services.  My main concern would be fast pace games and network latency.  I would love to get into Nvidia's beta and try out Rocket League.  Though, if servers are put in Atlanta for me latency likely won't be a serious issue. Second one is getting new games or the big hit games that I personally care about.  I don't mind waiting a bit to get them, but also wouldn't want to be at a point where I need to buy hardware to play a game that isn't offered via a streaming service.",,reddog007,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Game streaming services,,,

They need all the features of PlayStation Now to *start* with, including the ability to play games locally. *Alternatively*, I would be okay with streaming only on a monthly cost IF they are providing a huge array of games for nothing but that monthly fee (like Xbox Game Pass or something), at a lowered service cost to make up for the lack of local games. If I suggested that to a Google accountant, I’m sure they’d run the numbers and find the whole venture to just not be profitable. If you ask me, this is dead in the water given Google’s inexperience catering to the needs of a real “gaming ecosystem”. Look at how miffed people are at Epic’s game launcher. I think they’re senile if they expect to replicate all the aspects of Steam/XBL/PSN that gamers are used to on day one and charge the same amount. It’s a bit like Microsoft premiering the Surface at iPad prices when the ecosystem and features just aren’t there yet. I made a video very recently about where monetization for these services could go; I think link promoting in a thread is against the rules but you can look at my thread posting history to find it.",,Katana314,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

In that sense, I could see it being useful to people with fewer resources. But a laptop is still way more money than a console... Yeah maybe I'm just not seeing it, but I don't get what exactly this is for. It's certainly not for me, considering I already have multiple consoles plus a PC that can handle moderate gaming. Click to expand... There are plenty of households that have cheap notebooks for work reasons, but can't afford a PS4 or Xbox One. I come from a poor background, and had a PS2 until I got an Xbox 360 in 2010. I did have access to my mother's notebook before then though, which she got for peanuts. If such a system existed back then, I wouldn't have needed a console to play the latest games, I would have just been able to use a browser extension. The promise of Stadia is that anyone can have access to a high-end gaming system, as long as they have a device that is capable of running chrome. This also implicitly renders console generations as a dead concept, with hardware updates for games presumably being something google will handle without extra cost to the player. So long as Stadia works when it launches this year, this very well could end up being the future of gaming. ====================::==================== Well according to Digital Foundry's analysis, the latest build of Stadia that they got their hands on had the same input latency as playing directly from an Xbox One X, and that was over a wifi connection. The input latency would be smaller when using a wired connection. The difference between Google and Onlive (Which later got turned into Playstation Now) is that Google has infinitely more computing power, server space and money to make this work. The biggest issue I have with Stadia isn't technological, it's ethical. Not only do you have the privacy concerns that inevitably come from megacorporations expanding their presence ever further into your life, there's the question of ownership. Preserving and archiving video game history is already problematic, especially on PC. But if Steam were to pull something from my Steam library I'd at least have the opportunity to keep it on my hard drive's local files. In an all streaming future, what's to prevent a company like Google just nuking a title from existence if they so choose?",,Chewgumma,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,JCC - Förceboat Parté - JC G4m3z thr34d 121,,,

But for Game/Apps cut has been pretty much standard at 30% from multiple digital storefronts/platforms for some time(likely including all the Consoles), and Apple didn't start it. Steam takes ~30%. Though policies vary more on subscriptions. It's just lately that you are getting more pushback from devs on the standard 30% cut that just about every successful digital storefront takes on Apps/Games. People calling digital storefronts/platforms a monopoly are mistaken. A monopolist is generally considered the sole producer of a product for which there are no close substitutes. Android phones would obviously be considered a close substitute for iPhones. Just like Xbox would be considered a close substitute for PlayStation. Now if you have 97% of the market like Microsoft had, then you can start throwing around the monopolist tag, but when you have 20%, is nothing more than disingenuous whining. To be clear I was making absolutely no assertions in what you quoted and responded to. I was simply asking if Sony takes a cut from Spotify for premium subscriptions and if so, what amount.

That's why Uber can't make it into certain markets / countries at all.

Here’s what to expect [br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095344.png""][br][br][br][br]Google is making a big play in gaming next week, but we’re still unsure exactly what that entails. For years, the company has toyed with the idea of getting involved in what is now the biggest sector of the entertainment industry, worth an [a href=""https://lpesports.com/e-sports-news/the-video-games-industry-is-bigger-than-hollywood""]estimated $138 billion dollars as of last fall[/a]. And it would make competitive sense: Amazon owns Twitch, Facebook acquired Oculus, and Microsoft has Xbox. The only other major tech company without a serious gaming platform or investment of its own, not counting mobile app stores, is Apple, although even the iPhone maker is now [a href=""https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/apple-reportedly-plans-netflix-for-games-subscription-service/""]rumored to be working on a game subscription service of its own[/a].[br][br]Google has always had many of the pieces required to challenge the likes of Sony and Nintendo. The Android operating system is the most-used mobile software on smartphones around the world, while the Chrome browser and Chromecast streaming platform have given the company an easy way to run applications in real time and access television sets. It’s not hard to imagine an Android or browser-based gaming service that can let you play advanced software on a living room TV.[br][br]But, until now, all we’ve seen are a few strong hints to what Google might be building. That changes on Tuesday of next week, when Google plans to hold its [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262215/google-gdc-19-keynote-event-teaser-video-project-stream""]first-ever keynote at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco[/a]. There’s been a lot of news over the past few months that gives us a good idea at what’s to come, but whatever Google does announce, it could have a big impact on an industry that is transforming how it builds, distributes, and sells games. Here’s a rundown what we know so far and what we think might be coming next week.[br][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095355.png""][br][br][br]Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge[br] It’s highly likely it involves cloud gaming [br][br]In teasing its GDC keynote, Google said it would unveil its “vision for the future of gaming.” And, going off numerous previous reports and public showings from the company itself, it’s highly likely the announcement involves a full-fledged cloud gaming service. [a href=""https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-may-step-into-gaming-with-yeti-streaming-service""]More than a year ago[/a], The Information first reported about Google’s Project Yeti, the codename for an internal division responsible for building a next-generation streaming service similar to existing but limited options like Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now.[br][br]Even before Sony and Nvidia’s services existed, cloud gaming had been a bit like the industry’s holy grail: a just-out-of-reach ideal that has preoccupied a number of startups like OnLive, Gaikai, and others, but that’s never been cracked because the infrastructure and economics haven’t been properly worked out.[br][br]CLOUD GAMING HAS BEEN THE INDUSTRY’S HOLY GRAIL FOR YEARS[br][br]The concept is relatively simple. What if, like Netflix and Spotify, you could not only digitally distribute games, but also stream them over the internet, so players wouldn’t need expensive hardware to play graphically-intensive titles? It’s difficult because games, unlike other forms of media, are both incredibly large in size and require real-time input from players. But it is doable, by wiring up the necessary hardware in a data center, running the game on a remote machine, and sending the video and receiving player commands over the internet.[br][br]Regardless, it’s been impressive how many additional companies have revealed cloud gaming services in the past few years, turning what was once a niche experimental effort in an industry-wide race to figure out the future. Microsoft has [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263405/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-demo-video""]gone public with its own game streaming platform[/a], xCloud, that it plans to start testing later this year. EA, after acquiring the rental and cloud gaming service GameFly, is [a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/eas-project-atlas-wants-your-gaming-to-run-on-cloud-computing-and-ai/""]now working on a product of its own called Project Atlas[/a]. Even Verizon is getting into the game, with a [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179048/verizon-gaming-video-game-streaming-service-vzg-nvidia-shield-android""]test service up and running on Nvidia Shield set-top boxes[/a]. Earlier this week, [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265818/valve-steam-link-anywhere-personal-cloud-service-gaming-pc-gdc-2019""]Valve expanded its Steam Link service[/a] to turn it into a personal cloud gaming app. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177253/amazon-cloud-gaming-service-rumor-job-posting""]Both Amazon and Nintendo[/a]are looking into the technology, too.[br][br]There’s been a number of obvious signs that Google is indeed working on cloud gaming. Most prominently, Google [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17924492/google-project-stream-game-assassins-creed-odyssey-free-testing""]launched its public test of Project Stream[/a], an experimental game streaming technology that worked directly in its Chrome browser. Through a partnership with Ubisoft, Google let you play the brand-new Assassin’s Creed Odyssey — without needing to purchase the game — on pretty much any machine, given you had a strong enough internet connection.[br][br]GOOGLE’S PROJECT STREAM TEST IS AN OBVIOUS SIGN OF WHAT’S TO COME[br][br]It was a remarkable experiment, not [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950998/google-project-stream-gaming-assasins-creed-odyssey-first-impression""]just because it actually worked quite well[/a], but also because a game studio as large as Ubisoft agreed to let one of its biggest launches of the year be a test subject. The test is now over, but Google [a href=""https://blog.google/technology/developers/pushing-limits-streaming-technology/""]set out to gather data[/a] from what it considered a “technical test to solve some of the biggest challenges of streaming,” data that could help inform whatever product it announces next week.[br][br]There’s also been a lot of strategic hires in the past 18 months or so that hint toward a large, legitimate push into the gaming sector. Phil Harrison, a long-time executive of both Sony and Microsoft’s Xbox team, [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/22/16921214/phil-harrison-google-games""]joined Google last year[/a] as a general manager and vice president, but working in an disclosed capacity. At the time, it was believed Harrison was going to help Google build out its virtual and augmented reality platforms as viable gaming businesses. But Harrison was also on the board of game streaming company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/16/4442372/inside-gaikai-how-to-make-cloud-gaming-as-easy-as-watching-youtube""]Gaikai[/a], a company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4010420/sonys-playstation-4-will-use-gaikai-game-streaming-technology""]acquired by Sony in 2012[/a] and instrumental to the launch of its PlayStation Now service. So it’s likely Harrison is helping Google in its similar efforts.[br][br]Later in the year, [a href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1564647&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjackbuser%2F""]Google hired Jack Buser[/a], who was a senior director at Sony’s game streaming unit and led the PlayStation platform’s social efforts before that. Shortly after, Google [a href=""https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/30/google-hires-sonys-playstation-vr-guru-and-magic-lab-head-richard-marks/""]also hired Sony senior research engineer Richard Marks[/a], who helped build the PlayStation VR headset and Move controller.[br][br]And just last week, gaming industry veteran Jade Raymond [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/13/18263911/jade-raymond-google-vp""]also joined Google as a vice president[/a], though we don’t what team or division she’ll be leading. The timing may not be coincidental. Raymond, who was executive producer and co-creator of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed and later joined Electronic Arts, could be heading up some type of creative division at Google, or one responsible for developer outreach given her connections at big studios and publishers.[br][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][br][br]Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge[br][br] There’s a hardware component, and it may involve Chromecast [br][br]We don’t have too much to go on regarding what this service might look like, but we do know that there’s a strong likelihood there is custom Google hardware involved. Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware and its senior vice president of devices, tweeted out a link to the GDC keynote earlier this week:[br][br]Osterloh oversees Pixel phones, Google Home devices, and the myriad other hardware products the search giant now produces in-house. Whether that means we’re getting a Pixel-branded cloud gaming console or something else entirely is unclear. But it’s interesting nonetheless to see Osterloh involved in some way. [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]Kotaku[/a] [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]’s Jason Schreier[/a], who corroborated many of the initial details about Google’s upcoming service last summer, also reported that hardware will be one of three big components to the service, the other two being streaming and a massive in-house developer division that sounds very much like what Raymond could be involved in.[br][br]If we had to speculate on what exactly a Google game-streaming platform look like, we don’t have to look too hard. That’s because it could very well already exist, at least in part, as Chromecast. Google’s streaming dongle is already capable of letting you play Android games on your TV using screen mirroring from a compatible smartphone.[br][br]Now, that’s not to say that this new game streaming platform will just piggyback off Chromecast. But Chromecast does provide a model for how Google might go about delivering gaming experiences to a TV. For one, it’s a no-frills package that plugs in through one port and stays out of the way. And because cloud gaming, like media streaming, doesn’t require a ton of local processing power, the hardware can be lightweight and cheap. Given the amount of buzz Google is creating here though, it seems more likely it’ll drop all-new hardware specifically for gaming.[br][br] There could be a game controller to go with it [br][br]You can’t have console-quality gaming (if that is indeed what Google is going for) without some type of peripheral. For Google, that means building your own controller. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257911/google-patent-game-controller-project-stream-streaming-service-render""]According to a patent revealed late last week[/a], that might be exactly what the company has done, with images showing off a Google-branded gamepad that like a cross between a PlayStation controller and the [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]ill-fated[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] [/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]Ouya’s[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] gamepad[/a] from a half-decade ago.[br][br][br][br][br][br][br]Image: Google[br][br]This, even if Google doesn’t produce an actual console, might be why Osterloh’s hardware division is involved. For one, if Microsoft and Sony are building competing services, Google might not want its customers using other companies’ controllers.[br][br]And it’s a no-brainer that a service of this type would need to be first-and-foremost a controller-centric experience. As it stands right now, any kind of cloud gaming service is probably going to have at least some issues with connectivity. The bar for console game performance is much lower than on PC, where competitive games require the best connections possible and even milliseconds of latency matter to hardcore players.[br][br]In other words, this probably isn’t going to launch as a mouse-and-keyboard experience, at least not at first. So while we might not get Fortnite , Apex Legends , or Dota 2 on Google’s platform, there’s a good chance this service could very well be a place to play big-budget, single-player games like Assassin’s Creed .[br][br] ====================::==================== Thanks for sharing",,Gyang Peter,France,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,Everything we think we know about Google’s mystery gaming announcement,,,

I just wanted to emphasize that there is no too big to fail in their markets and how fast it can go. There was no bailout for Nokia and there won't be one for Steam. Steam has been under pressure for quite some time, with more and more AAA titles leaving their platform for self publishing. Now you get an (malicious) actor, that starts to buy the upcoming interesting titles, making Steam even less attractive. Finally netflix like game subscription services are tested and major players have (i.e. Playstation now) or will be starting (i.e. Google) their game streaming services. Steam has to react now and should take their gloves off. Sitting by idle will not work out well in the long run (imho)",,cassiopei,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Terrible and that’s with dedicated developers. (Phil Harrison @ google is pitching the same idea he pitched @ Sony) 2-YouTube integration doesn’t appeal to gamers at all. It appeals to streamers which will monopolize and there will eventually be less streamers in a convoluted market. 3-The games will suck. Expect a lot of Android type games on your television. Most will be phone conversions. There’s no way a game developer will make a dedicated game for this streaming service. 4-They will get crushed by Nintendo. Let’s face it this is Nintendo’s bread and butter. Nintendo’s been making mobile games long before mobile games were a thing and their cell phone games are far superior to most other phone games. 5-They’ll have to bet kids will start loving less appealing simplified games. Poor families are Googles market here. Will the games be better than watching Netflix? 6-streaming gaming service means you’ll need good internet. Like cable internet. That’s 65 dollars a month minimum. Google hasn’t been rolling out the fiber lines past some California areas so the streaming won’t be pretty. PlayStation Now worked for me with cable internet most of the time but not all the time. To have the whole game on the cloud is inefficient and will create new pain points for data centers. 7-We see this every year. A fully cloud based video game streaming service, but why not just go buy an Xbox and put it in your living room? There are 20 companies that revealed the same thing yesterday so why do we care that Googles doing it? Because it can be tied to their YouTube services? 8-Google is so spread out and loosely goosey that their competitors can also tie their streaming services to YouTube. Google wouldn’t find out and if they did they would have to make some sort of mandate that would be a PR mess. This would also force competitors to use better competing streaming services.",,PlayMoreExvius,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

183665527034,3/24/2019,http://aaronaknightca.tumblr.com/post/183665527034,"Google


Yesterday Google announced its long-anticipated streaming game platform, Stadia. In the news post we called it an “invasion” of gaming: this combination platform and delivery service has the potential to compete with consoles, PCs, and mobile games, all at once.

Google’s ambition is huge, but it’s appropriate to the task. The game industry as we know it is stagnating in terms of innovation, but its biggest corporate players are well-entrenched and experienced. If Stadia is to compete with the likes of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, it needs to nail three crucial elements when it launches later in 2019.

Get the Games

The most important piece in the gaming platform puzzle is, naturally, the games. Consoles live and die on their game selection, and securing exclusive and desirable titles (either from third-party publishers or developers owned by the console manufacturer) is the best way to make sure you’re going to succeed.

With Stadia, Google is already on the right track. Its best move is undoubtedly becoming a publisher itself. Google hired Jade Raymond, formerly a game producer and studio head at mega-publishers EA and Ubisoft, to lead its own game studio. Stadia Games and Entertainment, a separate but linked company under Alphabet’s ever-widening umbrella, will be developing its own games for the Stadia platform as well as wooing independent developers to bring their games onboard.
Google’s Stadia studio, under Ubisoft and EA veteran Raymond, will woo developers. Google
Another good move: announcing Stadia at the yearly Game Developer Conference, instead of at the upcoming Google I/O show or E3. By introducing Stadia specifically to game developers and publishers, including quite a lot of time showing off the unique design flexibility  of its remote Linux- and Vulkan-powered hardware, surely ignited the imagination of a lot of game makers. Today, the day after the announcement, you can bet there are game directors and developers scrambling to meet with Google’s Stadia team at GDC, desperate to check out the platform and get games on at launch.

Stadia isn’t the first gaming platform to use a 100% remote streaming setup: the ill-fated OnLive eventually became Sony’s PlayStation Now, NVIDIA’s GeForce Now is currently in beta, and Shadow allows for a more techy, individualistic approach. Microsoft is almost certainly going to go into streaming in a big way with the next Xbox, and rumors suggest that Verizon and Amazon are looking into it as well.
Stadia already works with the industry’s most popular software tools. Google
But Stadia is the first streaming system to be built with streaming in mind from the ground up and upon the massive power of Google’s data centers and money. Demonstrating deep hooks in Chrome and YouTube (to capture the Twitch audience), powerful new ways to play split-screen and asynchronous multiplayer, and baked-in support for massively popular developer tools like Unreal Engine, Unity, CryEngine, and Havok are all smart moves for a new platform.

It means that not only will developers be able to port their existing projects to Stadia’s hardware easily, but they’ll also be able to create entirely new types of games that are only possible with access to Stadia’s web, streaming, and scalability functions.
DOOM Eternal is the only upcoming game confirmed to already be running on Stadia. Google
During the GDC presentation, Google demonstrated partner projects with Ubisoft, Bethesda, 2K, Square-Enix, Tangent Games, Tequila Works, and Q-Games, but at the time of writing only Id Software’s DOOM Eternal has been confirmed for release on Stadia. Of course, Google can still mess up its initial relationship by limiting developers with restrictive platform rules, or by simply asking them for too much of a cut of their profits. Which is a nice segue into…

The Price is Right

No disagreements there. Keyword, of course, being option. I just hate it whenever somebody mentions streaming, and all the tech journalist outfits start harping about how this time its for realz the end of consoles/pcs. I mean, we own so little of our entertainment as it is, so anything that reduces ownership even further is, imo, not something to look forward to. I think EA has the right idea. Subscription service, but let me DL/install the games to my machine. Perfect for those yearly titles or something where you know you really only want to play through the campaign and leave it. Steam: Sir Boors PSN: Sir_Boors It's a great time to be a nerd. ====================::==================== Quote: : ↑ Mar 25th, 2019 3:28 pm Keep in mind current gaming blanket subscriptions like Gamepass and EA Access only came to exist as a response by EA and MS trying to make up for declining sales of their own games in addition to offering a handful of third party and indie games that aren't exactly hot sellers. To me that's a totally different situation from Google trying to gain audience by offering a service where you can get all brand new games from all major publishers many of which don't have a problem making $60 per physical and digital sale. If they're going to successfully attract games from those publishers to Stadia then a subscription model of any kind makes no sense to me. Publishers like Rockstar and Activision who break records make a billion dollars a year or whatever selling individual copies aren't going to ever put their games on a blanket subscription service. The only way those games show up on Stadia is by Google giving them the ability to match what they make on current platforms. Game Pass and EA Access are not streaming services though. You can download the games and play them as long as your subscription is active but its all being done locally. They were designed for the exact reason you described. The barrier for entry here is so low that it will attract people that can't or are unwilling to drop 200+$ on a console. In that sense its not really trying to compete with XB1 and PS4 but trying to find a market that hasn't been tapped yet. PSNow is the only comparison we have. It's been around for years and the only way to use that service is a costly subscription. You cannot buy games off this service. If it It costs money to the provider every time someone even opens a game, I don't envision a scenario where they eat that cost after the initial point of sale. I'm not saying google will require an expensive subscription that covers all games ala PSNOW but I think at a minimum it will require some sort of subscription to use the service. I can't think of a single instance outside of movies where something reliant on the cloud in this capacity isn't tied to some subscription model and I'd be surprised if Stadia isnt any different. I think when these services all get up and running pricing is going to be extremely messy. I imagine we'll see a bunch of tiered subscriptions that covers the gauntlet from a basic subscription that'll allow you to play a few games that google is showcasing in the service and maybe give you access to buy/own/rent the rest of the games in the catalog at your request to a costly deluxe subscription that will give you access to all the games on the service and a bunch of tiers in between.",,SpicYMchaggis,Canada,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,Google launches Stadia gaming service - Page 2,,,

If all you have are massive data centers, everything looks like it should be streamed from those data centers.

Stadia, a new video game streaming platform from Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, is pitched as a way to bring high-quality games to a broader audience by lowering the cost of entry. Instead of requiring consumers to buy hardware like game consoles or high-end PC components, Stadia will run games in Google’s data centers and stream each frame to any device running the company’s Chrome web browser.

This isn’t the first game streaming service. The two most notable cracks at running games in the cloud are Sony’s PlayStation Now and NVIDIA’s GeForce Now. Stadia, and whatever Microsoft, Amazon, and perhaps Apple eventually launch, will join those services as companies race to build the “Netflix for games.”

I don’t doubt that the video game industry is heading toward a subscription model. But I do doubt that streaming games from the cloud will be a significant part of that future.

A solution looking for a problem

If you want to play a AAA video game, you need some hardware. Your choice today are game consoles or a PC with a graphics card. Those can cost a lot of money, and you then need to buy the game itself.

Gaming PCs aren’t cheap, especially if you opt for high-end parts. NVIDIA’s high-end RTX 2080 graphics card has an MSRP of $699, and that’s not even the most expensive option. Mid-range graphics cards can be had for around $200, but you still need other components like a CPU and memory. Even a budget gaming PC will cost at least $500.

Given the cost of entry for PC gaming, a cloud-based game streaming service would seem to make sense. But game consoles already offer a more budget-friendly option. The base versions of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, now in the back half of their life cycles, currently go for $300. Microsoft even offers a subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, which offers downloadable games for $9.99 per month.

Google hasn’t announced pricing for Stadia, but I doubt it will be all that inexpensive. The hardware to run games in the cloud probably isn’t cheap, and game publishers need to be compensated. PlayStation Now is $20 per month, but that service is powered by the guts of game consoles stuffed into data centers. It also offers downloadable games, since streaming only works well on strong internet connections.

The big question: Will Stadia end up costing less than the total cost of ownership of a game console?

Another big question: How well will Stadia even work? Streaming video over the internet is much simpler than streaming games. Video can be loaded ahead of time, ensuring smooth playback even on an unstable internet connection. But for game streaming, each frame needs to be transmitted to the player in real time. Trying to use Stadia will likely be an exercise in frustration on weaker internet connections.

Google has no doubt put a lot of time and effort into reducing latency and ensuring that Stadia works well enough for as many people as possible. But do people who don’t want to spend a few hundred dollars on a game console even want to play these games? And will they be willing to pay what will probably be a fairly steep subscription fee in order to do so? And do those people have rock-solid internet connections?

Hardware plus a game subscription service like Xbox Game Pass seems more likely to be the future of gaming than cloud streaming services. And for more casual gamers, mobile devices are plenty powerful enough to play popular games like Fortnite. That’s not to say that streaming doesn’t have a place, but it’s hard to see services like Stadia upending the gaming industry.

PSNow isn’t awful, but for $20/mo to play 720p/30Hz streamed, I don’t think it’s worthwhile. If it were that price with everything being downloadable, not just PS4 games, I could see more appeal, though. It would just feel weird at first. I mean I know we technically don't ""own"" the games that are on physical media, and we technically don't own the digital games we download to our consoles, and we technically won't own any games we stream from a service. But in the first two scenarios, the games can still be played after the company closes (assuming patches are sent to the consoles enabling offline play after the company closes). But with streaming, what if they just pick up and leave? A little scary to me...even my change to digital downloads is a little scary. Personally, I don’t worry about something like that. Sony, Microsoft, and Google likely aren’t going anywhere anytime soon, so I doubt there’s reason to stress about something like that, it’s just that you’re paying an extra premium to play lesser quality products than what a natively played game could offer. Imagine Game Pass, but instead of $10/mo to get full access to the games, you paid $20/mo to play them at 720p. It wouldn’t be nearly as popular, I’d wager. Same thing applies to PSNow, it just doesn’t offer the quality one would expect from their gaming experience and still charges an extra premium to play.",,flame030191,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade."" Unlike the recently announced Google Stadia, or PlayStation Now and Microsoft's xCloud, Apple's service is not cloud-based.

183545447890,3/18/2019,http://eduardobutton.tumblr.com/post/183545447890,"Could another subscription service be coming to the PlayStation 4? An image on the PlayStation 4 subreddit has gotten plenty of fans talking, sparking speculation that the EA Access subscription service will be coming to the platform.



A single screenshot from what is supposedly the Brazilian PlayStation Store doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. But it’s been enough to spark excitement from fans who have been wanting the service to come to the PS4.

If you aren’t familiar with EA Access, it’s a service that allows you to play through a selection of titles from the EA “vault.” It’s available for $29.99 on the Xbox One, so it stands to reason that the price would remain the same on the PlayStation 4. In addition to being able to play EA titles an unlimited number of times, members also get 10 percent off all EA purchases.

However, another big selling point on the service is the ability to try new releases from EA days before their official launch. It happened most recently with Anthem, which gave EA Access subscribers a ten-hour trial before it released. In fact, PlayStation 4 was the only platform to not have any way to play Anthem early, for better or worse.

If this is true, it would be a huge change from previous comments Sony has made. The company has said the service “does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect” when it was first announced. However, the past year has seen Sony change face on many fronts before, so its possible this could be another instance of that.

As EA Access is a service that has you download games, as opposed to streaming them, it does put into question if the library will differ from that of the Xbox One. Unlike that system, the PS4 does not have backwards compatibility and, while you can download PS2 and PS4 titles with PlayStation Now, you cannot do so with PS3 titles. If all of this turns out to be true, we would have to see if there would be any modifications for the PS4.

Would you want EA Access on the PlayStation 4? Let us know!

Google will stream the keynote live, starting at 10 a.m. PT/ 1 p.m. ET on YouTube. Details of the announcement have been kept under tight wraps, but Google is widely expected to reveal details about a game streaming service.

Google, at the end of 2018, tested such a service under the name of Project Stream. Games were run on cloud servers and streamed directly to players’ PCs, tablets, TVs, or pretty much anything with a screen. That’s fairly typical with films and programs these days, but the interactive nature of games (and the historically laggy qualities of most internet connections ) have made it impractical.

Care to watch the announcement? You can view it here:

Google’s hardly alone in its interest the streaming space. Sony already has a streaming service called PlayStation Now. And Microsoft, later this year, will begin public trials of Project xCloud, which will let players stream Xbox One games to computers, phones and tablets.

Video games have continued to claim a larger piece of the entertainment market in recent years. In 2017, U.S. consumers spent $36 billion on software, according to the Entertainment Software Association.

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller. ""We are working with some of the most innovative game developers in the world to create over 100 new and exclusive games to play across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Apple Arcade games will be great for families, respect user privacy and will not have ads or require any additional purchases. We think players of all ages are going to love Apple Arcade.""

Yesterday Google announced its long-anticipated streaming game platform, Stadia. In the news post we called it an “invasion” of gaming: this combination platform and delivery service has the potential to compete with consoles, PCs, and mobile games, all at once.

Google’s ambition is huge, but it’s appropriate to the task. The game industry as we know it is stagnating in terms of innovation, but its biggest corporate players are well-entrenched and experienced. If Stadia is to compete with the likes of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, it needs to nail three crucial elements when it launches later in 2019.

Get the Games

The most important piece in the gaming platform puzzle is, naturally, the games. Consoles live and die on their game selection, and securing exclusive and desirable titles (either from third-party publishers or developers owned by the console manufacturer) is the best way to make sure you’re going to succeed.

With Stadia, Google is already on the right track. Its best move is undoubtedly becoming a publisher itself. Google hired Jade Raymond, formerly a game producer and studio head at mega-publishers EA and Ubisoft, to lead its own game studio. Stadia Games and Entertainment, a separate but linked company under Alphabet’s ever-widening umbrella, will be developing its own games for the Stadia platform as well as wooing independent developers to bring their games onboard.
Google’s Stadia studio, under Ubisoft and EA veteran Raymond, will woo developers. Google
Another good move: announcing Stadia at the yearly Game Developer Conference, instead of at the upcoming Google I/O show or E3. By introducing Stadia specifically to game developers and publishers, including quite a lot of time showing off the unique design flexibility  of its remote Linux- and Vulkan-powered hardware, surely ignited the imagination of a lot of game makers. Today, the day after the announcement, you can bet there are game directors and developers scrambling to meet with Google’s Stadia team at GDC, desperate to check out the platform and get games on at launch.

Stadia isn’t the first gaming platform to use a 100% remote streaming setup: the ill-fated OnLive eventually became Sony’s PlayStation Now, NVIDIA’s GeForce Now is currently in beta, and Shadow allows for a more techy, individualistic approach. Microsoft is almost certainly going to go into streaming in a big way with the next Xbox, and rumors suggest that Verizon and Amazon are looking into it as well.
Stadia already works with the industry’s most popular software tools. Google
But Stadia is the first streaming system to be built with streaming in mind from the ground up and upon the massive power of Google’s data centers and money. Demonstrating deep hooks in Chrome and YouTube (to capture the Twitch audience), powerful new ways to play split-screen and asynchronous multiplayer, and baked-in support for massively popular developer tools like Unreal Engine, Unity, CryEngine, and Havok are all smart moves for a new platform.

It means that not only will developers be able to port their existing projects to Stadia’s hardware easily, but they’ll also be able to create entirely new types of games that are only possible with access to Stadia’s web, streaming, and scalability functions.
DOOM Eternal is the only upcoming game confirmed to already be running on Stadia. Google
During the GDC presentation, Google demonstrated partner projects with Ubisoft, Bethesda, 2K, Square-Enix, Tangent Games, Tequila Works, and Q-Games, but at the time of writing only Id Software’s DOOM Eternal has been confirmed for release on Stadia. Of course, Google can still mess up its initial relationship by limiting developers with restrictive platform rules, or by simply asking them for too much of a cut of their profits. Which is a nice segue into…

The Price is Right

سنقدم لكم في ملخص واحد كافة الإعلانات التي ظهرت في الفعالية، ولا شك أن الشركة دخلت عالم الألعاب بقوة، ويبدو أنها أصبحت بهذه السرعة، منافس حقيقي لكبار صناعة الترفيه، أمثال Sony و Microsoft و Nintendo.

خدمة Stadia



أعلنت الشركة عن خدمتها الخاصة لبث الألعاب، هذه الخدمة سوف تعمل كمنصة رقمية أو افتراضية يمكن من خلالها بث الألعاب، بآلية تشبه PlayStation Now عدا أنها لا تتوقف حصراً على جهاز بلايستيشن.

طريقة عمل الخدمة بسيطة، يمكنك من خلال أي جهاز لديك، سواء كان هاتف أم تابلت أم حاسب وغيره، أن تدخل إلى الخدمة عبر متصفح Chrome، وبالنسبة لبعض الألعاب، سوف تتمكن من الدخول إليها في خمس ثوان فقط، كيف هذا؟ ببساطة عندما تشاهد فيديو لها في جوجل من خلال متصفح Chrome، سوف تلاحظ وجود أيقونة “Play” أي أن هذه اللعبة متوفرة للعب عبر خدمة البث، وكل ما عليك هو الضغط على هذا الخيار لبدء اللعب.

نلخص لكم ميزات الخدمة الرئيسية كما يلي :

 * قادرة على تشغيل الألعاب بدقة 4K ومستقبلأ 8K 
 * الألعاب ستعمل بمعدل لا يقل عن 60 إطار في الثانية 
 * مكونات الخدمة الرئيسية هي التقنيات السحابية و Vulkan للمعالجة الرسومية ومعالجة API الحاسوبية 
 * تتفوق الخدمة في قوتها على أجهزة الألعاب المنزلية الحالية، بفضل امتلاكها 10.7 تيرافلوبس، أي تقريباً ضعف ما يمتلكه أقوى جهاز منزلي حالياً Xbox One X. 
 * تستطيع أثناء اللعب عبر الخدمة أن تتنافس وتتعاون مع لاعبين من منصات أخرى لأنها تدعم اللعب المشترك، وهذا يشمل أيضاً ملفات الحفظ وإنجازاتك في الألعاب 
 * تعد الشركة بأن الخدمة سوف تعمل بأداء واتصال ثابت غير متقطع، حتى ولو لم يكن لديك إنترنت فائق السرعة 
 * سيتم طرح الخدمة في هذه السنة، بداية مع دول أوروبا وأمريكا وكندا وبريطانيا 
 Stadia Controller



صرحت الشركة أيضاً عن Stadia Controller يد التحكم الخاصة بهذه الخدمة، بالطبع تستطيع استخدام الكيبورد والفأرة إذا كان هذا ما يناسبك، إلا أن الشركة قررت إطلاق يد تحكم خاصة مع أزرار وميزات تماثل أيدي التحكم الموجودة في الوقت المعاصر.

هذه الأزرار تشمل عناصر التحكم الرئيسية وزر مشاركة المحتوى، وهنالك زر إضافي وهو Google Assistant حيث يعتبر زر اختصار للانتقال مباشرة إلى خدمة المساعد الصوتي المعروف من الشركة.

بالنسبة لطريقة توصيل يد التحكم، تتم مباشرة وبسهولة عبر الاتصال اللاسلكي.



Doom Eternal



لعبة Doom Eternal ستكون من أوائل الألعاب التي تدعم الخدمة ويمكن لعبها من خلالها، وهذا تصريح رسمي جاء من  id Software.

ستكون الخدمة قادرة على تشغيل العبة باستخدام وحدة معالجة رسومية واحدة من وحداتها الخاصة، دليل على تفوقها التقني.

كما وسوف تعمل اللعبة بمعدل 60 إطار وبدقة 4K.

183581019308,3/20/2019,http://fpnews-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183581019308,"Now that just about anyone who cares about gaming has announced or hinted at plans for a game streaming service, Google has also decided to announce its plans for the same. This service, >as we now know, is called Project Stadia.

On the surface, Stadia is very promising. Google promises to leverage its cloud computing capability to deliver “instant access” to any supported game at resolutions up to 4K 60 fps "" in HDR and with surround sound no less "" on any device, even a tablet or phone. Google intends for this service to also work with YouTube where anyone should be able to dive into a game from a video they’re watching on said game.

It sounds fascinating to be sure, and I think as gamers, we’re all excited at the prospect of playing Doom Eternal on our phones while on the move. However, the reality is far harsher.

Cloud gaming is still far too impractical to replace traditional gaming.

To begin with, Google is very late to the party. Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now services have been available for years now. Steam supports in-home streaming to any compatible device and recently announced support for streaming your PC game library to any device anywhere over the internet. EA, the publishers of popular games like Battlefield and FIFA, announced Project Atlas last year and there are bigger and bigger hints that Amazon and Facebook are already working on something similar. Microsoft is also leveraging its Azure cloud and Xbox gaming properties to build yet another (and far more compelling) game streaming platform. Hell, there are rumours that the next Xbox will be a cloud-based gaming platform rather than a physical console.

Being late to the party isn’t a bad thing if you, like Apple, take advantage of the learnings from the stumblings of your competitors. With Stadia, Google only seems to be playing catch up.

Cloud gaming: How it works

When you play a game, it’s running on your device (computer, tablet, console). The input you give via a controller or whatever other input method is sent to your device and then the game responds.

The lag between you sending input and seeing a response on screen is called input lag. When it comes to games running on your device, that latency could be as low as 5 ms.

In the case of cloud gaming, the processing of the game happens “in the cloud”, which completely eliminates the need for beefy hardware on your end. Your inputs are simply streamed over the internet to a cloud-based computer, that input is processed and then the game’s response is streamed back to you. In Stadia’s case, Google is apparently using powerful AMD hardware to do the processing.





Given that all the processing is happening elsewhere, you simply need an internet-connected device with a display and control inputs.

On paper, this is great. In reality, this is a horror story. Allow me to explain.

The issues with cloud gaming

Cloud gaming is still a far-fetched dream for good reason. There are enormous technical and bandwidth challenges that are hard to address in even developed countries like the US.

Bandwidth: Google estimates that you will need a bandwidth of 25 Mbps to play a game over the cloud via Stadia. This translates to a crippling 10-12 Gb per hour. How many of us are getting buy with 1.5 Gb/day? And this is just for 1080p 60 fps gameplay, factor in 4K 60 fps gaming with HDR and you’re looking at an exponential increase in data consumption.

To be clear, this is a recommended bandwidth and it should be possible to play on a much slower connection as long as you’re willing to sacrifice quality. This has always been an issue with cloud gaming and Google has announced nothing that addresses the issue.

Latency: This is by far the biggest hurdle of all. When playing on your PC or phone, your input travels virtually instantaneously to your device. When playing on the cloud, your input might travel hundreds of kilometres over the internet before it’s received by the cloud server, and then it must travel back that same distance before you see a response. This could result in a latency of anywhere between 40 ms to 200 ms and beyond, which is entirely dependent on your ISP and the vagaries of your cellular network.

The sheer amount of lag in gameplay precludes any possibility of competitive gaming. Only the most casual of games will be worth playing on such a service. Google has attempted to reduce some of this lag by designing their controller to connect directly to its servers rather than your device, and that should help. Whether it actually works is something we’ll only hear about once the service is trialled at scale.

Quality: Yet another issue is quality. If you don’t have access to the bandwidth required, you’re going to see a massive loss in visual fidelity. Google has made no announcement of new compression algorithms or of any steps taken to mitigate quality loss on a relatively low-bandwidth network.





In other words, you need an infallible, blazing fast connection for any form of cloud gaming to work, and these are issues that have remained unaddressed since the inception of cloud gaming as a concept. Google has brought nothing new to the table, so to speak.

Video streaming services like YouTube and Netflix don’t suffer from these issues because the content is fixed and can be pre-loaded. When it comes to gaming, the computer can’t pre-empt your moves and speculatively buffer your actions, not yet anyway.

And there’s still more to be concerned about.

The impracticality of it

Given bandwidth constraints, gaming on the go is simply impractical. This means that gaming on a tablet or phone, while ideal, will never happen except in extreme circumstances. We can’t even play PUBG Mobile on the go without worrying about latency issues.

This also means that such gaming will only happen at home or at cafes, which would, in turn, mean that you’re gaming on a PC or console. Worse still, gaming on your TV will require that you buy hardware from Google (the Stadia controller and a Chromecast).

Several years in the future, when 5G is a thing, then we can probably revisit cloud gaming and look on it as a practical gaming platform. At the moment, if you’re…

 * going to be playing at home 
 * going to need dedicated hardware 
 * going to suffer massive latency issues regardless 
 * going to pay a subscription fee to choose from a limited library of games… 
… why wouldn’t you just pick up a game console or gaming PC instead? Better yet, don’t you already own one?

Most mobile device games are built to be smaller, bite sized games that can be played for a few minutes at a time, or longer periods if the game is bigger. But they aren't going to replace console gaming. Console gaming is a different experience from mobile gaming, and phones just don't have the capability of having/running games that can even compete with AAA titles on console. > The big three know mobile gaming is the future that's why we have game pass, PlayStation Now/Remote play and the Switch. Gamepass does nothing for mobile gaming. Playstation Now/Remote play is not what I'm talking about. Not streaming games to your phone. I'm talking about it directly playing using the phone's hardware. Nintendo has been in the handheld market since before smartphones were a thing. They've always been in the mobile market. > However instead of developing their own mobile platform to invade the mobile market they are using the base that iOS and Android already setup. Like I mentioned already, Nintendo already has their own mobile gaming devices. They don't have to push for mobile phone gaming, although they can as that does bring in extra $$$. But their games on mobile phones are still not the same gaming experience as if you were to buy a Switch and play BOTW. They are built with a phone in mind. Sony and Microsoft make more than enough money that they aren't forced to push for mobile gaming since people will pay the big money for the full console experience.",,unusedwings,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Google’s Netflix-like Stadia instantly makes it a video game powerhouse





Google CEO Sundar Pichai announces Stadia.


 James Martin/CNET


For years, we played video games in arcades. Then we huddled in front of specialized consoles hooked up to our living room televisions. The most dedicated of us built our own expensive PCs for the best experience.

Google is hoping to push another big change in gaming.

On Tuesday, Google announced Stadia, a service that lets you play games by way of a wide variety of devices and an internet connection, similar to how you watch shows and movies on Netflix.

 Google rolls out Stadia gaming service and controller 

3:53


The selling point for Stadia is convenience: You don’t need a hunky game console or expensive PC. Just a TV, browser, phone or low-end PC that can surf the web using Google’s Chrome browser. And a specialized controller from Google that connects to its service over Wi-Fi.



Google’s promise for Stadia.


 James Martin/CNET


“Our ambition is far beyond a single game,” said Google’s Phil Harrison. Instead, the company sees the opportunity to give players “instant access” to a game by clicking a link. “The power of instant access is magical, and it’s already transformed the music and movie industries.”

The project will launch in the US, Canada, the UK and Europe in 2019. Google didn’t say how much games will cost to play, though the company said it plans to say more in the summer.

Google sees gaming as a new way to seep into your life — as if email, search, YouTube and its Android software aren’t enough — through the promise of massive convenience. Who needs to spend hundreds of dollars on Microsoft’s Xbox One, Sony’s PlayStation 4, Nintendo’s Switch or a PC when you can just play a game over the internet on a scrawny laptop?

Though Google isn’t the first company to offer game streaming, its entry into the space could make waves within the video game world. Google has lots of money, and it’s made its name by offering reliable services like Gmail, Google Maps and Google Photos for free or on the cheap.

With Google’s streaming service you’ll no longer have to go to a retailer like Amazon, Best Buy or GameStop to get the latest title. Nor will you have to potentially wait hours to download it from online stores like Valve’s Steam. Instead, Google says, all you’ll need is a fast internet connection and a controller, and you’re set.

A decade coming

I played my first streamed game about a decade ago, through a service run by a now-defunct startup called OnLive. Back then, the company offered to sell me access to hit games like the hit sci-fi shooting game Borderlands, playable through a PC, Mac or a little set-top box and a controller.

Just like with Netflix, all I had to do was log in, choose what I wanted to play, and start. Sometimes the visuals would garble, just like they did back then with movie streaming too. But it worked. It felt like the future.

I’ve been waiting for that future ever since.

OnLive eventually shut down in 2015, but other contenders have popped up. Sony launched its PlayStation Now streaming game service in 2014, as a compliment to its popular PlayStation 4 game console. Microsoft and Electronic Arts, meanwhile, have said they’re developing competing services as well, though they haven’t offered firm launch dates. Even Comcast, the TV and internet provider, has dabbled in game streaming, most recently rumored to be considering purchase of the Korean game company Nexon. 

They’re all betting this technology will eventually upend the way we play video games much in the same way Netflix did our movie watching a decade ago. The question is when.

“The power and accessibility of streaming will give billions unprecedented opportunities to play video games in the future,” said Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, in a statement. “This is only the beginning.”

A new promise

Google pitched its service as a way to bring different people in the game industry together, including players, streamers and coders. The company said it’s developed ways to start playing a game after clicking a link in YouTube, for example. 

Google’s also partnered with game development software makers like Epic Games and Unity. As a result, Google’s high-performance servers will stream games at up to 4k ultra-high-definition video, at 60-frames per second, meaning animations will move smoothly. 

Already, Google said, Stadia is able to deliver games with more performance than Microsoft’s Xbox One X and Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro combined. And, Google said it eventually expects to double that performance as game developer create even more complex games.

Google won’t just rely on other game makers though. The company said it will follow Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo in building its own specialized games for its service, through a studio called Stadia Games and Entertainment. “We are on the brink of a huge revolution in gaming,” said Jade Raymond, head of the game making group and an industry veteran.

In the meantime, Google said it plans to closely knit its game service with YouTube, offering new ways for people to compete and play with one another. That was particularly exciting to Matthew Patrick, a popular YouTube gaming personality known as MatPat. “It unites technology and entertainment in ways we’ve never seen before,” he said.

And if all control input latency issues can be 100% mitigated, you will eventually be telling your children of a time when you actually owned a physical or digital copy of your game. All the casuals will be jumping on the streaming bandwagon because that's just the kind of shit casuals do. Additionally, with the emergence of dirt-poor millennials who are lucky to have a pot to piss in (let alone an expensive gaming console or rig), the demand for streaming games will be driven even higher. As demand for consoles and $3000 gaming rigs goes down, the prices of those items will be driven up which will further decrease the demand for physical gaming hardware as more and more gamers jump ship in favor of less the less-costly streaming option. The cycle will repeat until gaming hardware is too expensive for even the most privileged richfags. It's inevitable. Being an oldfag who's been around since the Commodore/Atari eras, I've seen our games slowly slipping from our grasp as we went from physical copies to mostly digital copies and now heading toward not even owning a digital copy at all. Soon will be gone the days of pulling out an old console or building a retro gaming rig so you can play your old games. Once the rightsholders decide they want to make a game disappear, they just remove it from the streaming service and it's gone for good. So fuck the future basically. It's going to suck for gaming and you cannot prove me wrong. ====================::==================== >>16268447 Where are you getting this information from?

And 25Mbps for 4K, which they have determined is a worthwhile service to make available. And you now saying ""which most people have"" completely contradicts the entire point of your original argument which was ""waaah, I only have 52kbps!!!! SO I'M LIMITED"" > Not all copper cables are the same. Just FYI. I'm well aware. You are the one who said ""That is a physical limitation of copper."" You didn't say ""that is a physical limitation of MY particular copper cable."" > Yes, it is. No. ""There is something physical that is your limitation."" Is grammatically correct. If you are going to assert it isn't, you need to provide justification. Tell me what is incorrect about it. > And as already covered, this WILL reach most people's bandwidth limitations. NO. IT WON'T. When the average person has over DOUBLE the recommended download speed, you're not going to hit people's bandwidth limitations. > I used to be a sysadmin. So do I. Then you must've been a shitty one if you don't even understand basic Networking. > ""Our measurement here was using a LAN connection to the router, with 200mbps of bandwidth."" Cool. They did measurements on 200Mbps. What are you trying to prove? Google's recommendation is 20Mbps https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/google-stadia-internet-requirements-for-1080p-60fps-4k-revealed-2010348 ""We were able to test a lot of this with our Project Stream test late last year, starting back in October,"" said Harrison in conversation with Kotaku. ""To get 1080p, 60 frames per second, required approximately 25 megabits per second. In fact, we use less than that, but that's where we put our recommended limit at. But with innovations that we've made on the streamer side and on the compression side since then, when we launch, we will be able to get to 4K but only raise that bandwidth to about 30 megabits per second. So if you have less bandwidth, we'll give you a lower resolution… We do a lot of that for you in the background, and we will only offer up the appropriate bandwidth for the infrastructure that you have.” > Not for 0 latency. Oh my god. You are seriously so fucking dumb. Game streaming latency will not change. If you don't have the download speeds and bandwidth necessary to get everything at the same latency, they are doing active compression and will send you lower resolution video. If you don't meet the minimum, it just won't stream at all. With normal video, you can buffer because it doesn't require input. You can't do that with a game. You're demonstrating a COMPLETE lack of understanding of what's being done here. Moreover, TCP/IP doesn't even send ""big files"" over that could smash your bandwidth and increase latency. Even with the buffering video, the latency is the same. Video is broken into packets and sent over the internet just like anything else. > As you stated, not all cities have 200Mbps. 1. THEY DON'T NEED 200Mbps. 2. THOSE WERE AVERAGES. EVERY major U.S. city has at least one provider pushing >200Mbps. 3. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE CITIES TO USE THE SERVICE > I am talking about ""most people's limit"". WHICH IS WHY I SAID YOU WERE CHANGING THE SUBJECT AND TALKING ABOUT IRRELEVANT NONESENSE. Because, 1: The conversation you chimed in on was about the absolute limits imposed by physics. 2: EVEN IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ""MOST PEOPLE'S LIMIT"" YOU'D STILL BE WRONG. > If this were the case then Netflix wouldn't need to use compression. Netflix video compression has nothing to do with latency.... jfc It has to do with making the total filesize smaller, so that the whole file can be sent over faster. Latency is about how long it takes to get the packets from one place to another. Seriously dude. Take a basic networking class. > The only speed we have seen this running at so far is 200Mbps. That's not even remotely true. I participated in the beta with a 50Mbps connection. There are hundreds of videos out there of people using this exact technology on a variety of connections. Moreover, there are several competitors already to market with similar solutions you can test and use without issue on much slower connections. Shadow, GeForce Now, PSNow, etc. > Irony. God, you're fucking dense. I'm giving up. Every single thing you're saying is SO wrong that I'm completely convinced you're just trolling me at this point.

183695068114,3/25/2019,http://aresworld-universe.tumblr.com/post/183695068114,"It looks like PlayStation is ending the sale of game download codes in physical stores.

Long-time Twitter leaker Wario64 has released a memo sent by PlayStation to GameStop stores worldwide, stating that “Sony will no longer provide full game digital download codes to [any] retailers” from April 1.

While games with a physical disc release will still be offered in-store, digital only games will now only be available for sale through the PSN store itself, accessed directly via your PlayStation console. 

 * Streaming games? Check out our PlayStation Now review
 * Google Stadia: everything you need to know
 * Sony PS4 review
Stores will still, however, be able to sell general top-up codes for adding credit to PSN accounts.

The memo specifies that the move only affects Sony game releases, and has no effect on the policy of Microsoft or Nintendo, who have yet to make a similar announcement.

Long live the e-store

For as long as games have been sold digitally, physical stores like the UK’s Game, and the US’s Gamestop, Walmart and the like have offered in-store purchases of digital titles – effectively selling players a one-use code they can then use to download.

While the process of getting the game on your console in this way is a bit inefficient, some people still like to browse in a bricks-and-mortar store, and may be more likely to buy something they can physically hold – even if there isn’t a real disc or cartridge inside it. That’s before considering them as surprise gifting options.

While this move is likely not to prove too disruptive in the short-term – the memo, at least, suggests removing the titles should only take “one hour to complete” – but it’s a further blow to physical stores, which are feeling more redundant the more our collective purchasing habits move online.

Monopoman posted... LOLIAmAnAlt posted... I've been pc/nintendo for a while now. Unfortunately you just can't get nintendo games on the pc. Well you can't get Sony games on PC either, its seems the only console manufacturer that actually puts out most of their games on PC is Microsoft. That is not true. Except for the latest games, many of Sony's older exclusives(including some from this gen) are available on PSNow which you can access on PC or via emulators. The Quantic games exclusives including Detroit Become Human are also about to be offered on the Epic website on PC. Eventually all the newer exclusives will also be made available on PSNow on PC. MS also owns the Windows OS platform on PC so basically they are offering their games on their own platform on PC and not just on Xbox One. They have been publishing PC games(MS Flight Simulator) long before even the Windows OS existed. Yeah Sony will offer their games on PC after they feel those specific games are no longer driving console sales which is pretty smart. I’m sure by the time PS5 comes out and they no longer care about selling PS4s they will put all the PS4 exclusives on PSNow. If you don’t mind waiting 4-5 years to play a game then there’s no point in buying consoles... I have thousands of games on steam. It will take a long time for me to get to the major games in my backlog much less the few games that Sony keeps exclusive. I can wait. There are plenty of multi-platforms(majority of games) to keep me busy, including hundreds of PC exclusives(from RTS to grand strategy to MOBA and flight simulator games) that are currently not available on consoles. Besides with the advent of live streaming, I think that Sony will eventually need to release their exclusives early. Otherwise they eventually will lose out on the billions of non console gamers on mobile, PC, smart phones, tablets, etc. that Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon are maneuvering to try gain a market share in. With the advent of streaming we don’t need gaming PCs anymore either since we will just be able to stream 4k60fps to out toasters anyway. Streaming is exactly what console companies want as they never made big profits from the hardware anyway. Also streaming will affect us PC gamers who enjoy the openness of this platform as streaming will take away any semblance of control from us. No more mods! I don't mind streaming. After trying Google's Project Stream AC Odyssey trial, I thought it was viable, but I think not everyone would have the data cap and internet infrastructure to be able to use live streaming, so consoles with disc players and PCs with hard drives will still be the norm for the next decade at least.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

What you are looking for is emulation. There are currently experimental emulators of the PS4, but they don't even boot to the operating system. PS3, Switch and Xbox 360 are a bit further (you can already run many games on very powerful PCs, albeit not perfectly and many won't work at all), more refined but still unfinished emulators of 3DS and Wii U, really complete and mature emulators of DS, PSP, Wii, PS2 and Gamecube, as well as most, but not all, older games consoles. Sony is offering a streaming service that allows you to stream a selection of [PS4, PS3 and PS2 games](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-now/) over the Internet to PCs, but performance is about equal, just with worse image quality, added lag and a rather substantial monthly fee. The only PS4 games you can play on PC right now are multiplatform titles that have also seen PC releases, which do indeed look and run better on decent hardware. You would have to purchase these games again, of course.",,DdCno1,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

They showed some examples for games like Dead Cells, Cuphead, and FH4. Wonder if it extends to creating a full on multi-touch interface, or just customized virtual controls.

183577094155,3/19/2019,http://eduardobutton.tumblr.com/post/183577094155,"After much speculation about what Google would be doing to change the face of gaming, we know have a much clearer picture of what that upheaval looks like: Google Stadia. Touted as a platform free of traditional boxes, Google Stadia allows you to play games instantly on nearly any screen, with all of the processing power being done by Google datacenters. Given that the power of even a single Google Stadia instance is more than the PS4 and Xbox One combined, there’s monumental potential for truly moving the industry forward with this next-gen tech. And it’s all streaming. But how does today’s announcement from Google change the landscape of video games? Where will we be in a year? Five years? A decade? Will I still be buying the next “PlayStation,” or does the console start to take on a different form?

I feel like Daily Reaction has been predicting this inevitable future since I restarted the column a couple weeks ago. In that short time I’ve talked about “consoles as a service,” where instead of a box, you pay for access to the ecosystem. I’ve talked about big brands being the ones to decide when physical media is “dead.” And then Google comes in a proves everything right in a big way, at least as far as their intentions go. Google wants to nail convenience, breaking down any of the current barriers to gaming (while adding a few of their own. We’ll get to those in a moment).

The pitch is simple. Stadia is a network platform where you can effectively play any game on the service through any screen or device that supports Chrome because the processing is done entirely in the cloud. It’s not unlike what Microsoft once attempted to achieve with its early Xbox One tech that caused a huge backlash, and then again with promises in Crackdown 3 that never delivered. Is Google’s pitch a reality, or a distant pipe dream of a future yet unrealized?

Google Stadia Puts on an Impressive Show

As one of the largest tech megacorporations in the world, Google has a lot of power to tap into, both from a financial perspective, as well as the power to force a change of this magnitude onto gaming. But is it really all that broad of a change? If you look at the state of gaming, Google Stadia is simply a sign post showing where we are now. Sony’s been exploring these kinds of options with remote play and PlayStation Now. Microsoft is expanding its cloud capabilities and taking focus off of the particulars of a specific box. Even Nintendo’s got some skin in the game with the desire to redefine how and where you play. Stadia simply takes all of those ideas and centralizes the focus of its entire service around them.



The ability to get high-quality AAA experiences on anything from a phone to a Chromebook to a low-end, off-the-shelf computer is tantalizing. No longer are high frame rates and gorgeous graphics limited to those with the money or know how to purchase or build high-end machines. There’s no waiting for a download. You can instantly move from device to device. Links can be placed anywhere to immediately jump into the game. That’s the ultimate combination of remote play, cloud computing, and the ability to play games almost anywhere and on anything, no longer tethered by the power of the hardware it’s being played on. My Pixel 2 XL has the capabilities of running a game through Stadia just as efficiently as a high-end PC or my PS4, if not more so.

Google Stadia’s promise is a broad one, and it doesn’t just provide for the players, but creates a threefold experience for players, content creators, and developers alike. Allowing everyone to tap into the “power of Google” is an enticing premise. Developers have more power at their hands than ever before. Content creators can connect with their viewers in unprecedented ways. Players get a more convenient gaming experience. It all sounds great, but closer examination of the early reveal misses the mark in a few key places.

Google Stadia Misses the ‘Living Room Experience’

Google came out swinging, and it was easy to be hyped by the buzzwords and flashy tech that Google was showing off, but one thing that struck me is that it misses a piece of the larger core experience of gaming. While they showed a lot of “click here to go into your game from YouTube” type of stuff, I never got a sense that there was a centralized library of games and experiences. There was nothing shown equivalent to the PS4 dashboard, and while I’m certain there will be, the lack of focus on the user’s library is concerning.

Stadia seems like an enormous video game network, reliant on the internet, but what if gaming to me is not about finding a streamer on YouTube and loading into a game from right where they are (because who wants to play a game from the start anymore, I guess)? What if I know what I want to play, and I just want to get home after a long day (or in my case, move from the office to the living room), plop down, and boot up Destiny 2, or The Division 2, or whatever other experience I’m playing? Again, I’m sure that Stadia will have this capability, it was just interesting to note the lack of focus on a type of gaming experience that is not inherently keyed off by some internet search.



Steam Boxes and other PCs designed to be a living room experience never really took off, and I imagine that it will be harder than Google thinks to get the layman to appreciate a network platform as a replacement for that box sitting next to their TV. Google has a stigma surrounding it associated with mobile and data collection, and even I, whose whole house runs on Google, have a hard time imagining myself booting up a Chromecast to play the latest AAA games. Stadia is pitched as this active experience of constant engagement via the internet, but that’s just not how some people are playing games. Will it work as a standard living room experience? Oh sure, but they are going to have a hard time selling it to most people who are comfortable with the status quo. It’s why we saw Microsoft back off the Xbox One innovations they originally wanted to launch with. A PlayStation box of some sort will still have a home in your living room.

The Missing Google Stadia Details

At a big and flashy keynote, you don’t want to focus on the potential downsides of the platform, but their absence from the presentation really highlighted what issues Stadia might have. What games will be supported on the platform? We know of a few partners, but if this is really designed to be a wholistic gaming experience, I would have to expect every title that’s not a first-party exclusive to launch on Stadia. If it’s missing anything (and doesn’t have a compelling lineup of its own first-party exclusives), it will stumble out of the gate. If Stadia is supposed to compete with the likes of Sony and Microsoft for platform attention, it needs to have effectively everything that both of those console manufacturers have. I’m not going to migrate over to Stadia if I still have to get another consoles to supplement the experience anyway.

How much is this thing going to cost. Being a network thing, I imagine that it’s some kind of subscription model and not a one-time access fee, but then how does that work for the games? Do I get access to the full library of games on the service? Is each game an additional fee? Are they added to any kind of library on my account? It’s a nice demo to show someone clicking on a YouTube video and instantly loading up Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, but I feel like they missed the part where that box pops up asking for my credit card number. If it’s subscription-based, that mitigates that, but presents mountains of other questions about ownership of those games. Could this effectively be the “Netflix for games” that spells an even more rapid death for physical media and traditional games ownership?

And then there are questions of network requirements. Cloud processing immediately means latency, and for all of the benefits that it has, it still inherently has to stream your button presses to the datacenter and then stream the video output back to you. No matter how fast the Google cloud is doing its work, that’s still inherently relying on local network connections to be able to handle that data transfer. That’s not even mentioning poor network infrastructure, data caps, and Net Neutrality issues, all of which could make the service prohibitively expensive with hidden costs, or simply non-functional at all. And what if my internet goes out, or I want to game where I don’t have internet access? Right now I have offline options, but with Google Stadia, I don’t. With Stadia, I would have not only been out of internet for weeks after my move to a new house, I would have been without gaming too.

Is Google Stadia the Future?

I think that Google Stadia is a signpost for the future, but it’s not the entire picture. This isn’t new territory at all. Sony’s been quietly building this kind of platform for years, starting with their acquisition of Gaikai seven years ago and of course, the current PlayStation Now service that was a result of that purchase. We’ll see the PlayStation 5 lean heavily into cloud gaming, but Sony is smart. We’ll also see them provide options. While Google puts up a huge flashy billboard for the tech, there are simply things that a home console does that Stadia can’t replicate.



At the bare minimum, Stadia will catch on with the tech nerds in the same way that new and flashy tech always does. Google Glass had a loyal following of people convinced it was the wave of the future. While the tech is cool, the longer I think about it, the less I think it will kill off consoles, or even have that big of an impact on the console market share. If anything, we’ll see Stadia as competition to PC gaming, rather than the console experience. Having a strong ecosystem is one thing that console manufacturers have done well. You’ve got PlayStation and Xbox loyal, who have their accounts and their trophies and their friends lists, and many won’t want to leave all of that behind for an internet-based platform.

If there’s anything there though, it’s that Google will push gaming forward. Whether Stadia becomes an industry staple or not, there’s no denying that every success and failure along the way has helped push gaming to new heights. People wrote VR off as a niche and encumbered experience that would never hit mainstream, yet we’ve seen immense success for the platform. Gaming experiences and the way we engage with games is chugging forward whether you like it or not. Google Stadia is definitely a stepping stone along the path to embracing new technologies and new experiences in gaming. As a bigger industry than movies and music, gaming has grown far beyond the typical “gamer.” With the pace of new technology, it’s really difficult to tell exactly where things will be in even five years.

My Ideal Google PlayStadiation Future

Ideally, what I’d love to see is Google working with console manufacturers, rather than as a competitor. I would love to be able to have my PlayStation console with the power of Google Stadia’s tech built into it. Let me access that cloud computing power, but also allow me to have the games stored locally. Let me stay with the PlayStation ecosystem, keeping my trophies and existing profile and purchases. It’s the best of both worlds. Who knows, with Google’s commitment to offering its tech to third-parties, maybe we’ll see Sony potentially exploring what they could do with it.

There’s a lot to take in with Google Stadia. Even if you aren’t quite buying into Google’s vision of a gaming future, it will inevitably have ripples into the gaming experiences you’ve come to know and love (or hate, as the sentiment I get from most of these comments tends to be). Just as music, movies, and books before it, we’re moving further and further away from the days of having a static platform and individual experiences. Consoles as a service is real, and we’ll see the first big iteration of that later this year. After that, we’ll continue to see how the current powers in the gaming industry respond with their own visions of what the next-generation of gaming looks like, and I’d be quite surprised if it doesn’t involve similar functionality.

Is Google Stadia the future of gaming? Probably not all by itself. There are too many hurdles and potential potholes right now, but I think it’s got a strong role to play as a signpost for the direction that games are headed.

For the purpose of argument, let’s assume that Google Stadia just works. Internet speed, latency and visual quality isn’t an issue. Is the product good enough to stand up on its own merits? Let’s also presume a Netflix-style subscription service (the most likely price model) rather than a Steam-like storefront. And thirdly in this rather generous scenario, Stadia is offering a wide library of games you actually want.

On the one hand, you would be able to immediately access a game you see on YouTube, play it, share it with your friends and seamless move it between devices, be it a smartphone, tablet, TV or potato laptop, without worrying about hardware investment. You could try out games early and find out if they’re good without committing $60 a pop to pre-orders or hundreds of dollars for next-gen hardware.

On the other hand, there are some glaring disadvantages to the model even if it works well. You don’t own the games yourself, they could be pulled by Google at any moment, and can’t be modded, played offline or saved for posterity. Not ideal, but if the price is right, it could well work for many.

Writing about how Stadia could compete in the gaming market, I guessed about $15-$20 for a subscription service to take on rivals like PlayStation Now, Xbox Game Pass, and Shadow. But Google might go even cheaper than that. After all, the company makes its money from our data by offering a suite of free online services like Google Photos, Gmail, Google Docs and so on. It’s Google Home range of smart speakers are very aggressively priced, and Mountain View may similar try to undercut the entrenched gaming giants as much as possible.

Are there any regular gamers ready to ditch their prized hardware? Anyone who’d like to game more but would prefer an on-demand streaming model to the traditional market?",,prosyscomtech,Singapore,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== In the beginning of the gen, sony talks trash about it. now since got some success on xbox, yea lets take it to",,Grown93,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA Access could reportedly be on the way to PlayStation 4,,,

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,gwynbleidd892,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

So I need to earn a LOT of Silvers, Golds & Platinums in 7 days to help boost me in Sony Rewards. What are the easiest & fastest 🏆 games on the PSNow service? Right now my guess is LEGO games. They seem quick & easy. Can those of you who are very familar with using PSNow & their game catalog please reply with a list of easy games with tons of trophies that YOU played?

It's basically both services in one right now. You also don't need PlayStation Plus for the multiplayer games that are on there (So 3 in 1). https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/09/20/playstation-now-adds-downloading-of-ps4-ps2-games/ They have been investing heavily on the PSN backbone infrastructure, and recently opened it up to several European regions as well. They are just not as vocal about it, probably because they are actively doing it for 5 years now. I still prefer local native play personally however.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,thediscoursehoernchen,Germany,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

I'm comparing it to local gaming. The ultimate goal is for streaming gaming to be indistinguishable from local gaming. Psnow is not that. I doubt either google or xcloud will be that. Psnow should be considered the lowest rung of the ladder that streaming services are shooting for. Doing exactly what sony has done is not progressing anything. What we have seen is a video from a service that is months away from the testing phase, a video we don't even know if was actually the service running or not. The only point I was making was that there is really nothing to base anything on at this time. It very well could suck, but this would be like basing judgement of a game on an alpha version. I personally view something at this stage as little more than a proof of concept video.",,Steppy_76,United States of America,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,

I tried out Project Stream in BC with a US VPN on a 100mb connection, and it ran surprisingly smooth. I haven't tried PSNow, but Project Stream was significantly smoother than GeForce Now which I already thought was decent. I think the one thing they did really well was purely prioritizing input. The video feed blurred up pretty rarely, but it did happen, and yet the movement was still pretty fluid. Barring intense multiplayer FPS games, I think I'd be willing to give it a shot. It did eat up data though, if you are capped in anyway this is a no go, taking something like 5-10gb/hour.",,PharaohsVizier,Canada,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Google launches Stadia gaming service,,,

That endgame only works if the service explodes among people not currently actively gaming, imo. Long term, yes, they would love for all gamers to convert. Streamed games aren't unique, and exclusives always have varying weight. They will be the *4th* entrant to the streaming market (GeForce Now, PSNow, Stadia, and xCloud) and the gaming market is *very* different from business and productivity software. There you can get people outright *dependent* on your software, switching off of it will kill their productivity and incur switching costs. So folks pay up. Individuals consuming entertainment media are not nearly as easily pinned down. I mean have you seen Netflix destroy the existence of retail movies? Players? Definitely *dented* it (a lot). Steam and Playstation aren't going away either. > increase price of owned software/hardware That's something they don't have in their power to do. Increasing the price of XB outright will just tank it and Sony+Valve+Nintendo will reap the rewards. Increasing the price of software... just can't happen. They don't control any of those prices. I don't anticipate anything in PC/Console gaming changing really. At least not directly.

Imagine not being able to go back and play your ps2, N64, or what have you just because those consoles aren't getting support anymore.

For example, in this case Naughty Dog is owned by Sony, so whether they make a profit on the game itself or not, they're gonna profit in other ways. Uncharted 4 for example was PS4's 3rd bestselling game ever, but even that is just 8.7M units. Did it turn a profit? Sure, but not a huge one on the game itself. God of War for all it's accolades sold just 5M copies. Did it turn a profit after development and marketing costs? Probably not. Maybe it broke even. But again, you can get away with those numbers on a console-only game as they make up for that in PS4 sales, PSPlus & PSNow subscriptions. So in the case of companies like EA (who are multiplatform), their profits are tied to the game itself. I think your point is excellent but just a small thing with your examples - God of War sold 5 million in the first month, not overall https://au.ign.com/articles/2018/05/25/god-of-war-sales-top-5-million-in-the-first-month Fair point!

The Xbox One X makes a great multimedia device(movies and games) if you have a home theater setup at home especially with features like a 4K HDR blu ray player, Dolby Atmos, DTS-X, Dolby Vision HDR, Free Sync, Auto Low Latency Mode and Voice control via Alexa. It can access nearly 600 back compatible games from previous gens, many of which have been enhanced to 4K resolution, as well as console exclusives that you cannot access on PC. All these features are not available on Sony or Nintendo. You can also use your Xbox One X like a steam link by accessing your PC games in another room in the house via wifi in resolutions up to 4K on your console. Now that it supports mouse and keyboard support it basically becomes a mid range gaming PC + steam link + 4K HDR blu ray device + home theater enhancer, all at a price 1/2 to 1/3 of that of an equivalent gaming PC. There are many reasons to get it aside from gaming and therefore makes a very good supplement to a gaming PC which is still the best platform for gaming overall because of its extensive library. Sony and Nintendo is just good for playing their few exclusives(and you can access many of those on PC via PSNow, Epic(Quantic games like Detroit Becoming Human will soon be released on PC at this site, and emulators) while their 3rd party multi-platform games are generally inferior to the versions found on the Xbox One X.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

The more “out there” an idea is, the easier it is to poke holes and be cynical about it because it seems like such a pipe dream that is overpromising. There’s a lot of valid concerns about game streaming. But a lot of people think that a big company like Google has not put latency and data limits at the top of their list of concerns when developing Stadia. I’m sure when the service launches, there will be tons of horror stories and people saying “I told you so!” But I’m excited to see how the platform develops if Google really stays with it and is serious about pushing game streaming. The Oculus Rift was not the end-all-be-all of VR. But it gave VR development new life and kicked off a VR arms race.

A game streaming service isn't aimed at the core gaming community, it's aimed at people who: haven't had a console in years, or have never had one but would be willing to play games if they didn't have have to buy one. people who only buy 1 or 2 games a year, usually the big multiplayer shooter titles and/or sports games. Kids who's parents won't buy them a new console yet cause they already have a system. Are you sure? I mean that like saying no one is who goes to the cinemas regularly will care about Netflix, small screen, you have to wait for the mail to arrive etc. And look st it now, biggest entertainment company in the world. the difference is, this isn't adding netflix, its trading it. I like both, but I would never give up the ability to go to a theater, or the ability to buy whatever I wanted for ONLY netflix, and be doomed to only watch what they had on the service at the time. Like psnow or gamepass this could be a nice service to have in addition to my regular console, but not as a replacement.",,singhellotaku,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

183702120771,3/25/2019,http://cellerityweb.tumblr.com/post/183702120771,"At this year’s Game Developer Conference in San Francisco last week, Google finally pulled the curtain back on one of the worst kept secrets in gaming: Google Stadia, its games streaming service. This article does a capable job of explaining what the Stadia is, but in a nutshell: Stadia is a cloud-based games streaming service that allows players to interact with video games instantly, without downloading anything, on their tablets, laptops, televisions, and mobile phones so long as their internet connection is sufficiently fast. Some specific hardware requirements, such as the fact that Stadia will not work on non-Pixel Android phones at launch, have dampened the lofty aspirations of the service, though.

Stadia isn’t the first ambitious cloud-based games streaming service to come to market: OnLive somewhat infamously was sold for less than $5MM after raising more than $50MM in financing and reaching a peak valuation of nearly $2BN. Gaikai fared better with a $380MM sale to Sony in 2012 and now allegedly powers the “Playstation Now” service, and GameFly acquired Playcast in 2015 to deliver what it called a “Netflix for Games” service. 

That term is important, as it has become something of a popular call to arms lately as a number of different companies, from Microsoft to Amazon to Apple to Electronic Arts and a subsidiary of Rovio, have announced products that could be deemed a “Netflix of Gaming”. And in fact, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s CEO, may have tipped his hand for such an endeavor from Netflix itself when he stated that the company “compete(s) with (and lose(s) to) Fortnite more than HBO. When YouTube went down globally for a few minutes in October, (Netflix’s) viewing and signups spiked for that time.”

Almost nothing is known about how Stadia will source content, what it will cost to use, what requirements will be placed on developers in order to have their games appear on the platform, etc. Former Ubisoft executive Jade Raymond recently joined Google to head an internal first-party studio to make games for Stadia, but it’s unknown how large that studio will be or how many games it will publish per year. Google will surely expect to lean heavily on third-party developers for content on the Stadia at launch and for the foreseeable future. As Netflix would certify, being the Netflix of something is expensive: the company is expected to spend $15BN on content in 2019.

And indeed, as this article asserts, the Stadia may be more of a YouTube strategy than a games streaming strategy — or, at least, the Stadia may serve the purpose of further aggrandizing YouTube as games streaming goes mainstream. 50BN hours of gameplay footage were watched on YouTube in 2018, and 200MM people watch gameplay footage each day on YouTube: YouTube is an important part of the gaming ecosystem, and Stadia unifies the viewing experience and the first-hand playing experience in a way that could create a powerful virtuous circle between first-person and third-person gaming engagement. Players will be able to drop pins into gameplay footage on YouTube and then immediately open the game at that moment and start playing. Likewise, players will be able to seamlessly switch between devices, retaining their in situ game state.

It is that last capability that could perhaps be the most monumental promise of Stadia: if every game is playable on a mobile device (all computation is done in the cloud, so end-user hardware profile is irrelevant), then every game is a mobile game. And the Stadia effectively distintermediates the app stores: with Stadia, there is no download requirement in playing a game, and the click-to-stream mechanism effectively extends game discovery to the entire surface area of the web. If game distribution escapes the app stores, then the entire mobile advertising ecosystem could become upended, with a critical pain point — the click-to-install conversion dynamic — being circumvented and otherwise poorly-converting ad inventory like mobile web banners, interstitials, and, conveniently for Google, YouTube inventory becoming suddenly very interesting to mobile advertisers. 

This could be a very interesting development. The mobile app ecosystem has been trending toward intermediation as the biggest mobile properties start to look more and more like app stores themselves; Stadia could change that by abstracting away the idea of an app store, at least as games are concerned. Of course, a vast amount of territory exists between now and Stadia being a hugely successful platform that has materially, indelibly changed the landscape of the mobile app ecosystem. Stadia is a complex, ambitious undertaking, so of course it could fall; it’s frankly annoying that so many media commentators elect to vocalize that very obvious fact.

But if the Stadia is successful, it will have a massive impact on the way that smartphone users interact with games. That possibility is intriguing.

They could be fulfilling their original idea for the Xbox One, set back by the always online and DRM backlash, but given 6 extra years of development to improve it. Right now they've only been showing it off with Xbox One games, but what if their next Gen games can run fully or partially on xCloud? What if the Xbox One is forwards compatible with their next gen games, running them partially on the local hardware and partially using xCloud? They could still release a new stronger hardware that plays the games natively, or run games entirely in the cloud through an xCloud app on non-Xbox platforms. Imagine launching a next gen platform with millions of compatible hardware units already in consumers hands, and an upgrade option for those that want full native performance on those games. https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/3/15/17123452/microsoft-gaming-cloud-xbox-future https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/23/microsoft-is-building-low-cost-streaming-only-xbox-says-report/ This seems to lend support to my idea. Only thing missing is the Xbox One being potentially forwards compatible Presumably, it is part of the next platform, though it isn't ""the platform"" anymore than the backwards compatibility program is ""the platform"". There are too many people with too limited internet (on top of people with sufficiently capable internet, but service caps that are rampant in countries like the US) to exploit it properly at the current technological level (where Microsoft has described it, so far, as effectively an Xbox One S-powered server), much less the level that Microsoft will need to compete with Playstation 5 and PC advancements. This was always an issue with Gaikai/PSNow too--an interesting theory I've heard is that the whole point of PSNow was not as a replacement (pretty obvious, since it was never even capable of that for people with the best internet), but as a promotional tool: ""You've played this Playstation game on a whim, but in a very limited form. Why not commit to buying it in a much better form, i.e. non-streaming?"" Not by coincidence, Sony always leaned hard on the PS3 library for Gaikai--not only was this not easily emulated, most PS3 games are far less daunting than your average PS4 game in terms if visual fidelity (there are PS3 games in that library that look worse than their Xbox 360 counterpart, which is even older hardware). Google is probably the biggest internet technology company in the world, or very close to it. Google hasn't answered how the Stadia program will address those issues beyond the unspoken default ""It just won't work well, or at all, for millions of people."" They'll have to reconcile that at some point too, considering even their presentation of Assassin's Creed: Odyssey , on a tech floor (with absurdly good internet), technically managed to look worse than high-end consoles and have worse latency. Imagine how it'll look for someone with typical internet, and not whatever fiber connection Google was using at their own demonstration in front of thousands of developers. Imagine how much it'll cost the average consumer to have the minimum bandwidth necessary, as oppose to what they have? Microsoft has to figure this out as well. Of course, the current library model--that software will operate on earlier hardware, and not stream to it (not excluding that possibility)--may or may not allow for forwards compatibility. The-Cloud(tm) offers a novel solution to that problem. Of course, then Microsoft also has to sell new hardware to spur excitement, to attract third-party developers, and recoup the costs of 'Project Scarlet'. Streaming is potentially a really good accessory for that, if it works well, but not a good replacement. Netflix was supposed to kill all other forms of video consumption. It (or rather, media streaming in general) does dominate, but ironically, has long since added support (and actively encouraged) downloading video in advanced. And Netflix never had to contend with upload speed and latency (no one cares if Avengers: Infinity War has 300 ms lag, so long as the audio mostly matches up). It's exciting to speculate on, in any case. We could be a lot closer to an all-streaming standard, or something close to it (UHD films are selling slightly better than bluray discs did at the same point in their lifetime, thanks to a larger market worldwide), but the demand and promised video quality and low latency are rising much faster than internet service is improving for the targeted audience--and no one wants to tell people that things will need to suck so that streaming might succeed. Most people are playing Xbox One and PS4 on DSL-like connections that stutter with 1080p video. Google has been talking a really big game, way bigger than Microsoft--4K at 60hz ""to start"", and then 8K (7680x4320, or 16 times a 1080p screen) at 120 hz ""in the future"". The proposed 10 teraflop hardware will cost a few thousand dollars today , though obviously that price will (slowly) go down. But even that initial minimum would be incredibly daunting to stream at. Streaming to a switch, with its 720p 60 hz screen is a lot more realistic.

I recently just found this website, and I have to say, it is amazing. I have been playing the PlayStation ever since I was 4 when I got a PS2, and have been a hardcore gamer ever since. One thing I really love about PlayStation now is earning trophies. Earning trophies make me feel really awesome about myself and I get respect from people both in real life and on the Internet when I tell of my accomplishments. This website's leaderboards is a great way to also compare myself against players like me everywhere, and I also love how cheaters are easily removed. However, there is a problem. Years ago, on Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, I unfortunately ran into a hacker. I was in a random lobby on the TranZit zombies map trying to find people to complete the Tower of Babble trophy, which required you to complete the easter egg/quest for the map. While my friend and I were in the cornfield trying to do the steps, we started having random trophies appear on our screen, which we figured were just a few glitches because I recognized them as campaign trophies. I soon realized what was happening the second I earned a trophy for the zombies map Mob of the Dead, which was a DLC map that I did not own at that time. By the time I realized what was happening, the damage was already done to me and my friend. Even after the game ended, we were still being awarded trophies for absolutely no reason. It did stop eventually, and when it did it left me a few trophies to earn in the campaign that I could still earn legitimately. Black Ops 2 is my rarest platinum, but because I know I unintentionally was hacked into making the platinum easier I did not include it in my trophy cabinet. I am an honest person when it comes to things like this and I would like to know how I can not be flagged as illegitimate because of events I had no control of. Is there any way that I can talk to the owner of the site or someone who helps out with maintaining the cheating system? I'm worried someone will see the dates for the hacked trophies and make the assumption that I am a cheater, which is not the case. I appreciate everyone that reads this long post and gives me helpful advice or even helps me solve the problem that I am currently facing. ====================::==================== Just make sure you hide your game, and any other game you find this has happened too.",,malachi1987,United States of America,,,Positive,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,I need help staying legitimate on the leaderboards!,,,

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Wait so if I paid £19.99 for my years subscription I could play FIFA for free? Rather than the 50 odd quid it costs... Seems a no brainer or are there other costs involved?",,Mako_Sulu,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,F,,,,EA Access could reportedly be on the way to PlayStation 4,,,

183588158986,3/20/2019,http://techbotic.tumblr.com/post/183588158986,"Google


Yesterday Google announced its long-anticipated streaming game platform, Stadia. In the news post we called it an “invasion” of gaming: this combination platform and delivery service has the potential to compete with consoles, PCs, and mobile games, all at once.

Google’s ambition is huge, but it’s appropriate to the task. The game industry as we know it is stagnating in terms of innovation, but its biggest corporate players are well-entrenched and experienced. If Stadia is to compete with the likes of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, it needs to nail three crucial elements when it launches later in 2019.

Get the Games

The most important piece in the gaming platform puzzle is, naturally, the games. Consoles live and die on their game selection, and securing exclusive and desirable titles (either from third-party publishers or developers owned by the console manufacturer) is the best way to make sure you’re going to succeed.

With Stadia, Google is already on the right track. Its best move is undoubtedly becoming a publisher itself. Google hired Jade Raymond, formerly a game producer and studio head at mega-publishers EA and Ubisoft, to lead its own game studio. Stadia Games and Entertainment, a separate but linked company under Alphabet’s ever-widening umbrella, will be developing its own games for the Stadia platform as well as wooing independent developers to bring their games onboard.
Google’s Stadia studio, under Ubisoft and EA veteran Raymond, will woo developers. Google
Another good move: announcing Stadia at the yearly Game Developer Conference, instead of at the upcoming Google I/O show or E3. By introducing Stadia specifically to game developers and publishers, including quite a lot of time showing off the unique design flexibility  of its remote Linux- and Vulkan-powered hardware, surely ignited the imagination of a lot of game makers. Today, the day after the announcement, you can bet there are game directors and developers scrambling to meet with Google’s Stadia team at GDC, desperate to check out the platform and get games on at launch.

Stadia isn’t the first gaming platform to use a 100% remote streaming setup: the ill-fated OnLive eventually became Sony’s PlayStation Now, NVIDIA’s GeForce Now is currently in beta, and Shadow allows for a more techy, individualistic approach. Microsoft is almost certainly going to go into streaming in a big way with the next Xbox, and rumors suggest that Verizon and Amazon are looking into it as well.
Stadia already works with the industry’s most popular software tools. Google
But Stadia is the first streaming system to be built with streaming in mind from the ground up and upon the massive power of Google’s data centers and money. Demonstrating deep hooks in Chrome and YouTube (to capture the Twitch audience), powerful new ways to play split-screen and asynchronous multiplayer, and baked-in support for massively popular developer tools like Unreal Engine, Unity, CryEngine, and Havok are all smart moves for a new platform.

It means that not only will developers be able to port their existing projects to Stadia’s hardware easily, but they’ll also be able to create entirely new types of games that are only possible with access to Stadia’s web, streaming, and scalability functions.
DOOM Eternal is the only upcoming game confirmed to already be running on Stadia. Google
During the GDC presentation, Google demonstrated partner projects with Ubisoft, Bethesda, 2K, Square-Enix, Tangent Games, Tequila Works, and Q-Games, but at the time of writing only Id Software’s DOOM Eternal has been confirmed for release on Stadia. Of course, Google can still mess up its initial relationship by limiting developers with restrictive platform rules, or by simply asking them for too much of a cut of their profits. Which is a nice segue into…

The Price is Right

Named Apple Arcade, the service is designed for mobile, desktop, and the living room. You can check out a brief overview trailer below. >Essentially, Apple's service takes the form of a monthly subscription that provides unlimited access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. Development partners include Sega, Konami, Disney, Sumo Digital, Cartoon Network, and more–more than 100 exclusive games will become part of the service. More games will be added ""all the time,"" the company said. It will support games across iOS devices (both iPhones and iPads), MacOS, and Apple TV, and you'll be able to transfer your progress between these different platforms. In other words, you can move from playing something on your phone to your TV or laptop, for instance. >Apple went on to state that every game would be playable offline, while future game updates and DLC would be included at no extra cost. In addition, you can pick up on other devices right where you left off. Apple Arcade will have its own tab on the App Store, and the games will be free of ads and microtransactions. Apple Arcade will be available in 150 countries ""this fall."" One key bit of information–how much it will cost–has not yet been shared. Apple says pricing and more details are still to come. >During the event, we got a brief look at a few of the games coming to the service, with more being confirmed afterward in a press release. Among the confirmed games are Sonic Racing, Lego Brawls, Oceanhorn 2, Overland, Fantasian (from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi), and Beyond the Steel Sky (which is being worked on by Dave Gibbons of Watchmen fame). We also got a list of Apple Arcade developers and publishers, including names like Lego, Disney, Sega, and Konami. >Apple says it will be ""contributing to the development costs and working closely with creators to bring the games to life,"" suggesting it will do more than just pay developers for their games to be included. ""The App Store is the world's biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade, the first game subscription service for mobile, desktop and the living room,"" said Apple marking boss Phil Schiller.

The bigger question is how would you pay a team to develop a high-quality game? I assume today's computers are much better suited than the old assembly machines during the NES era, say. And you could always distribute the game to Steam / GOG / Playstation Now etc. to give access to players who don't have the classic consoles. Somewhere in there is the equation for making actual money, which would ultimately be the bottom line. It would be great if a legit game studio would release a new game, assuming it was top notch (a big assumption). When I think of the best homebrew original games, they still don't crack the top 50 or even 100 all-time for the systems they were created for. The best possibility is a small, indy team comes to a major publisher with a game already done and the publisher helps them make it even better, then distributes.

You're acting like talent is a static force that works solely for one company. But we already know that Google's gaming branch is being run by Jade Raymond and Phil Harrison, two names you can't exactly scoff at given their pedigree in the industry. They're people with interesting connections, especially Phil. The guy worked closely with all of Sony's first party studios during his time at Playstation. He could very easily snag some of that Playstation magic to come work for Google. For example, we already know Amy Hennig is looking for work after EA cancelled her Star Wars game, and Phil Harrison worked with her on the Uncharted games. It's not a huge leap to assume that she's been working on something for google. There's also the not insignificant factor of price and availability. If the rumours are true and the streaming service is a big part of the platform, then it's going to make the current market run for its money. Playstation Now is the only similar service I can think of, and they don't include the PS4's whole library on there. Heck, they don't even have a fraction of the PS3's library on there yet.

183584565146,3/20/2019,http://franciscojavierfernandez.tumblr.com/post/183584565146,"Google presenta Stadia *Javier Fernandez auditor*

Google ha presentado la plataforma a través de la cuál ingresará al mundo de los videojuegos, se trata de Stadia un servicio de stream Gaming. En su lanzamiento esta alternativa estará disponible para computadoras de escritorio, laptops, televisores y dispositivos móviles.

El Stream Gaming es un servicio a través del cual un videojuego es ejecutado en un servidor online en su totalidad, la información visual es transmitida en formato de video al jugador en su hogar, y el jugador por su parte envía los datos de los comandos que ingresa a través del teclado, el mouse o un gamepad. El principal beneficio del sistema es que permite al jugador acceder a productos de calidad sin importar el nivel del hardware y sin tener que descargar datos y ocupar parte de su disco rígido.

Futuro y antecedentes

Google ha señalado que el servicio será lanzado tanto en Europa, Canadá y los Estados Unidos durante 2019. Sin embargo todavía no existen datos sobre el precio. Uno de los primeros títulos que estará disponible será Doom Eternal.

Stadia no es el primer proyecto de Stream Gaming, actualmente existen alternativas tales como PlayStation Now, Geoforce Now, y xCloud. Tampoco es el primer paso de Google en este espacio, ya había intentado algo similar con Project Stream.

El problema que han atravesado estos servicios es que necesitan conexiones a Internet rápidas y estables. El lag en el mundo de los videojuegos en línea sigue siendo un problema y a menudo produce fracciones de segundo que deciden la victoria o la derrota.

 El Gamepad

El anuncio de Stadia fue acompañado con el lanzamiento de un gamepad. El dispositivo es similar a los que se pueden encontrar en las consolas, con la única particularidad de contar con un botón para capturar y compartir video directo a YouTube.

Sin embargo en el aspecto técnico Google ha señalado que el dispositivo se conectará de forma directa a Internet, para acceder a los servidores de la compañía más rápidamente y evitar demoras.

Características

El objetivo de Google es que Stadia brinde juegos en una resolución 4K a 60 FPS, con una posible mejora a 8K y 120 FPS en el futuro. Los servicios actuales son capaces de alcanzar las primeras marcas, pero solo en algunos títulos.

Integración con YouTube

Google espera que la conexión con YouTube sea de dos sentidos. Esto quiere decir que cuando una persona con el servicio Stadia esté viendo un video de un juego en YouTube tendrá la posibilidad de presionar un botón y jugar ese juego en dicha plataforma en tan solo unos pocos segundos.

La entrada Google presenta Stadia aparece primero en RedUSERS.

SO I'M LIMITED"" I am limited though. So are most people. That's my point. You need to take bottlenecks at the user's end into consideration. People aren't going to buy something they cannot use. >I'm well aware. You are the one who said ""That is a physical limitation of copper."" You didn't say ""that is a physical limitation of MY particular copper cable."" There are different limits of different copper cables. >No. ""There is something physical that is your limitation.""

""your limitation is something physical"" would be correct. >NO. IT WON'T. When the average person has over DOUBLE the recommended download speed, you're not going to hit people's bandwidth limitations. Again, we haven't seen it running on this. >Then you must've been a shitty one if you don't even understand basic Networking. Says the one that doesn't understand bottlenecks. >Cool. They did measurements on 200Mbps. What are you trying to prove?

""To get 1080p, 60 frames per second, required approximately 25 megabits per second. In fact, we use less than that, but that's where we put our recommended limit at. But with innovations that we've made on the streamer side and on the compression side since then, when we launch, we will be able to get to 4K but only raise that bandwidth to about 30 megabits per second. So if you have less bandwidth, we'll give you a lower resolution… We do a lot of that for you in the background, and we will only offer up the appropriate bandwidth for the infrastructure that you have.” Cool, where's the video of this so we can see for ourselves? >Oh my god. You are seriously so fucking dumb. >Game streaming latency will not change. You call me dumb but then argue my point for me. Clever. >If you don't have the download speeds and bandwidth necessary to get everything at the same latency, they are doing active compression and will send you lower resolution video. If you don't meet the minimum, it just won't stream at all. EXACTLY. So the sentence ""Partnered with various studios so latency shouldn't be a problem"" Is incorrect. >With normal video, you can buffer because it doesn't require input. You can't do that with a game. Exactly... >You're demonstrating a COMPLETE lack of understanding of what's being done here. Says the one LITERALLY ARGUING MY POINT. >Moreover, TCP/IP doesn't even send ""big files"" over that could smash your bandwidth and increase latency. Even with the buffering video, the latency is the same. Video is broken into packets and sent over the internet just like anything else. But streaming a game COULD increase latency. >THEY DON'T NEED 200Mbps. Do you have footage of it working on under 200Mbps with comparable input delay to a PC? >THOSE WERE AVERAGES. EVERY major U.S. city has at least one provider pushing >200Mbps. Yes, this is how averages work... >YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE CITIES TO USE THE SERVICE But you DO have to live somewhere with good enough internet to use this service. >WHICH IS WHY I SAID YOU WERE CHANGING THE SUBJECT AND TALKING ABOUT IRRELEVANT NONESENSE. >Because, 1: The conversation you chimed in on was about the absolute limits imposed by physics. 2: EVEN IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ""MOST PEOPLE'S LIMIT"" YOU'D STILL BE WRONG. I just pointed out that copper ALSO has its limits. >Netflix video compression has nothing to do with latency.... jfc Again, do a ping test, download something that consumes all of your bandwidth, watch the ping go up. >It has to do with making the total filesize smaller, so that the whole file can be sent over faster. This is called compression. >Latency is about how long it takes to get the packets from one place to another. I am glad you have a basic understanding of latency. >Seriously dude. Take a basic networking class. Why are you pretending like I don't know this information? >That's not even remotely true. I participated in the beta with a 50Mbps connection. There are hundreds of videos out there of people using this exact technology on a variety of connections. Oh, you have a Google Stadia controller do you? >Moreover, there are several competitors already to market with similar solutions you can test and use without issue on much slower connections. Shadow, GeForce Now, PSNow, etc. I have an Nvidia Shield. The input delay is over 1 second. This is why I am pointing out that this service will not be fit for everyone because of physical limitations in how the internet works. The connection between the chrome browser and google's servers is only as fast as the slowest connection between them. You should know this. >I'm giving up.

Google entered the fray last week when they announced Google Stadia, the ‘ultimate’ streaming service. With rumors of Wal-Mart, Amazon, and Verizon wanting a piece of the gaming streaming pie, it looks as if Sony might be making a pre-empitive strike to up their numbers for PlayStation Now with this amazing deal. As of this moment, Amazon unexpectedly dropped the price of the 12-month PlayStation Now subscription from $99.99 to the jaw-dropping price of $59.99! Credit: PlayStationBrahs Store link: Amazon US Extra: not familiar with pricing but it seems as if it was $100 before and now $60, flagged as rumor since it's up in the air ATM.

I tried out Project Stream in BC with a US VPN on a 100mb connection, and it ran surprisingly smooth. I haven't tried PSNow, but Project Stream was significantly smoother than GeForce Now which I already thought was decent. I think the one thing they did really well was purely prioritizing input. The video feed blurred up pretty rarely, but it did happen, and yet the movement was still pretty fluid. Barring intense multiplayer FPS games, I think I'd be willing to give it a shot.

Some very interesting ideas, the social part looks really interesting, integration with YouTube and Google Assistant among other features.They say it's ready for 4K and 60fps, and they expect it to go beyond that, and I remember that they did some beta tests with Assassins Creed before. The most disruptive part in here is the lack of hardware, you just need a PC, a TV ready, or a smartphone. The only hardware showed was a Google's game controller. Do you think this could mean something for the home console market? What does it mean for Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo? I think they will be OK as long as they keep a strong exclusive library (worried about Microsoft). It is too early to say if this will be another Ouya, or something focused for the casual or mobile gamers, ot if they are going to target the hardcore gamers too. ====================::==================== I think it is too early and the world is not ready. It is questionable if it would work in the US for the speed connection and availability, so imagine the rest of the world.

183583707356,3/20/2019,http://eveningstandard-new-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183583707356,"Google has its sights set on the gaming industry with the launch of new digital platform Stadia, which will allow users to stream games without the need for a console.

The tech giant’s latest endeavour will allow users to access games that have traditionally only been available to download or be purchased on disc using just an internet connection.

Google is promising better-than-console quality games at high resolution and 60 frames per second, with surround sound.

A new controller was also unveiled at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.

Google is hoping to capitalise on its partnership with YouTube, which has proved an extremely popular platform with gamers who share tips and skills online.

Phil Harrison, Google’s new head of gaming, said: “In a world where there are more than 200 million people watching game-related content daily on YouTube, Stadia makes many of those games playable with the press of a button.

“If you watch one of your favourite creators playing Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, simply click the ‘play now’ button.

“Seconds later, you’ll be running around ancient Greece in your own game, on your own adventure – no downloads, no updates, no patches and no installs.”

At launch, Google Stadia will work on existing desktops, laptops, TVs and phones.

Google is expected to trickle out more details about Stadia as they edge ever closer to its release date, but here’s what we know so far:

When will Google Stadia launch?

Google is yet to announce a release date, but they did reveal that Stadia would launch at some point in 2019 in the US, UK, Canada and Europe.

What games will be available on Google Stadia?

So far, the only game announced for the service is id Software’s major title Doom Eternal.

According to Google, the game will run on Stadia at 4K resolution with HD colour at 60fps.

This is not the first time Google has experimented with game streaming. In 2018, as part of their Project Stream initiative, the firm made the Ubisoft game Assassin’s Creed available to play via the Chrome web browser.

Google Stadia price

Google has remained tight-lipped about the price of Stadia, but critics have already been speculating whether the platform will run as a subscription service similar to that of Netflix.

Using Sony’s streaming service PlayStation Now as a benchmark, which charges a subscription fee of £12.99 a month, tech website Inverse estimates that Stadia could be within a similar price range, though it’s unclear how much the Stadia’s controller will cost or whether it will be included with each subscription.

Google Stadia controller features

One thing Google was able to show off at the announcement event was their new custom controller.

In addition to a USB port and headphone jack, the slick controller has dedicated buttons for Google Assistant- powered voice features, YouTube sharing and capturing video of your gameplay.",,eveningstandard-new-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"Google Stadia price, release date, controller and games: What we know about the new gaming streaming platform",Post,,

1. Google Stadia: Here’s the good, the bad, and the questions



Google’s fantastic sounding launch of Google Stadia, shifting gaming to the cloud, was as genuinely exciting as it was disappointing. Let me explain!

First, the details:

Google Stadia is the name of Google’s game streaming service, which first debuted as a test called Project Stream.
 Now players can jump straight into a game with a single click – even from a YouTube video or embed on a website, without installs or hardware. It just works, and within five seconds, according to Google.
 Using Google’s state of the art network infrastructure, the company is promising seamless streaming, providing you have a good enough connection – more on that below.
 Stadia is designed to be available everywhere: the cloud-based service works seamlessly on a Chrome browser, as well as Chromecast Ultra devices. That means both desktops, laptops, and phones with Chrome, can instantly stream a game and start playing.
 No install, no patches, no downloads – just fire up the Stadia service, and games will be available, if you’re on a fast enough connection to handle the data requirements. 60FPS, 4K, and Googles hope to stretch to 8K, 120fps streaming in time. That’s crazy.
 You can switch devices within seconds, going from playing on your TV to your phone rapidly, for on the go gaming.
 There’s a Google controller which connects directly to a data center, or you can BYO favorite Xbox, PS4, or Switch controller too.
 This is for AAA games – one of the first will be Doom Eternal, from id Software.
 It will launch in 2019 in the US, Canada, UK, and most of Europe. Google has been working on it for years, going back as far as 2014.
 We don’t know much else about how the platform will work when it comes to pricing. On-going subscription costs, plus purchasing of premium titles?
 Google says it will share more about Stadia “this summer,” which we imagine means Stadia will have a big presence at E3 2019.
 There are loads more technical details (The Verge) too, including performance info and new GPU chip from AMD. Google suggests that input latency might even be low enough for FPS games, although that’s a bold claim.
 Can and will PC gamers now just game on any device? Will this kill the need for high-spec PCs and laptops for casual gamers and others?
 How soon will this kind of service – if not Stadia, than a competitor – make buying a $400 console (plus the games) no longer make sense? Being offline isn’t really an option for any game, anymore, including single player.

Questions:

Stadia is an exciting proposition: play games anywhere, from any platform that has a Google Chrome browser which is just about every device you own, including directly on your TV via Chromecast, is massive.
 The idea of having brilliant performance available without upfront cost for a gaming PC or console, available anywhere you go, is superb.
 Though, of course, there are reasons to be skeptical.
 Until we all see this working for us, it’s hard to really know how it will perform. What kind of DSL/Cable connection is sufficient? Do we need to wait for 5G?
 Putting game clients and multiplayer servers in one place seems like it will work to reduce latency, but the speed of light remains fixed.
 A large proportion of gamers aren’t worried about input lag and competitive edge, and don’t even know it really exists – and those that are.

Content:

The bigger problem is that Google doesn’t yet have the content. As Google’s announcement went on, our Slack channel lit up talking about the details and the lack of games announced.
 Instead we saw Google offer technical demonstrations, pitching to the developers at its developer conference rather than the wider audience.
 If Google was able to announce a single blockbuster game – Fortnite, PUBG, or Apex Legends, or something like Red Dead Redemption 2 on any platform, as my colleague Joe Hindy typed, that would’ve become a trending topic on Twitter that stayed there for three days. Doom Eternal was announced, but with no detail given, it didn’t have much pull.
 Instead, we saw Google pitch to encourage people to create for their platform.
 We saw game publishers id Software and Ubisoft involved, and two of the most popular game development engines, including Unreal and Unity, are supported. That’s encouraging from the get-go, but necessary as well.
 Stadia will live or die on content, and we don’t yet really know how it will convince existing publishers and game houses to join its platform.
 Scale counts, which Google mentioned, but its competitors that already have the games and IP are working on their own service. Epic is all-in on its own game store and Fortnite is its portal towards streaming gaming. (Imagine getting into a game of Fortnite within seconds, no install, no updates)
 Sony is notorious for never giving an inch and already has PlayStation Now, Microsoft is working on streaming via Project xCloud, Amazon is working on its own service, Geforce Now is good right now, and many more, as we’ve discussed previously.
 So how does Google get the big games it needs for Stadia to really, really matter?
 Google is starting its own game studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment, to produce its own titles, with people like Jade Redmond involved.
 But the memes have already started about a lack of games.
 And many wondered if this would become another Google product to launch and disappear within a few years, as so many of its products do. (Here are 50 examples.)
 And asking around my friends who are fringe gamers or not really into the tech scene, Stadia didn’t cross over into their consciousness – which Google may not mind just yet, given it has the reach to do so when it wants. Until it launches, that might not be necessary, as long as it gets publishers and developers on board.

Bonus: Google did pay a nice tribute to the Konami code with its controller. Type in the code () to the stadia.com website for a surprise.

2. Big breaking news: The EU has fined Google €1.49 billion for “abusive practices in online advertising” (EU): “Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites. This is illegal under EU anti-true rules … The misconduct lasted over 10 years.”

3. Disney moves from behemoth to colossus with the closing of 21st Century Fox deal, for $71.3 billion (NY Times). A Hollywood monster rises.

4. Apple released an iMac refresh for both its 4K and 5K models. That’s useful if you really wanted an iMac, but Apple leaving a completely outdated 5400RPM HDD as the default is terrible (MacRumors). If you’re going to buy one, you absolutely must pay $200 for an SSD upgrade. Also, expect more Apple device updates this week.

5. Apple’s MacBook ‘Flexgate’ is real, and Apple should acknowledge it (The Verge).

183587032677,3/19/2019,http://fortune-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183587032677,"Google is getting into video games. And it’s playing to win.

The search giant, speaking at the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in San Francisco Tuesday, unveiled Stadia, an ambitious game streaming service that could present the most significant challenge yet to console makers such as Sony and Nintendo.

Scheduled to launch later this year, Stadia will allow subscribers to play top-tier games at the maximum resolution on virtually any screen—TV, PC, laptop, phone, or tablet—without needing the latest and greatest processor, graphics card or console. Players will interact with games via a Stadia controller, made by Google.

The pricing model and other details for the service and controller will be unveiled later this summer.

Google has already signed up several major game publishers to the new service, but to ensure it also has major exclusive titles, it has also created its own studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment. Industry veteran Jade Raymond, a veteran of Ubisoft and Electronic Arts who led the creation of the Assassin’s Creed franchise (among others), will head that unit.

“The power and accessibility of streaming will give billions unprecedented opportunities to play video games in the future,” said Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot in a statement. “We are proud to partner with Google … building on what we’ve learned with Project Stream via Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. This is only the beginning, and we can’t wait to continue collaborating closely with Google on what’s next for Stadia.”

Prior to Tuesday’s announcement, Google executives sat down with Fortune to discuss Stadia’s evolution and what the company can offer gamers that competitors can’t.

“If you look at the games industry today, it’s very fragmented,” says Phil Harrison, vice president and general manager of Stadia. “You’ve got people playing on mobile, on PCs, on consoles. I would love for Stadia to unify the screens, so that developers have a bigger audience to create for and gamers have the absolute best quality experience as they play and a seamless link to share what they play and what they stream with their friends.”

What is Stadia?

Stadia is more than the game-streaming service Google previewed with Project Stream last year. While it will offer a large catalog of titles, all playable in 4K at 60 frames per second with surround sound, it will also tie in with YouTube, letting players watch their favorite game streamers and, should the mood strike them, play the game they’re watching on that YouTube stream in seconds.

You Tube Creators, another term for streamers or influencers, are a central part of Stadia, says Harrison.

“Creators become a very important part of our platform,” he says. “A Creator can be talking about the latest game or the latest feature for a game and their subscribers and fans can click and instantly play that experience—and, in some cases, play that experience with the Creator. We’re bringing those two experiences together and that’s powered by technology that only Google has.”

Stadia got its start four years ago at Google; internal testing has been going on for about a year now. It was born, in some ways, from the company’s Chromecast project, the streaming media adapter that lets people play online content on their television.

Shanna Prevé, director of global product partnerships for Stadia, was the co-founder of Chromecast and has been a key member of Stadia’s creation. Development on this project, she says, has followed the same basic vision as Chromecast.

“With Chromecast, we bet big from the beginning on the future of the computer,” she says. “What we tried to do was look 10 years into the future and asked, ‘How can we build a product that would take advantage of where computing was heading?’ When I look at our approach with cloud gaming, we’ve taken a very similar approach. We wanted to bet big on the cloud, bet big on mobile and make sure there was tight software-hardware integration. I think that has transitioned to a very developer-first focus.”

Stadia, in fact, is viewed within Google as a data center, giving game makers access to tremendous amounts of computing horsepower that could lead to eliminating some of the limitations of modern game making. Game developers routinely have to kill planned features because a gaming system’s hardware is incapable of handling what they want it do to.

“For the last 40 years, game development has been device-centric,” says Harrison. “The creator of the game works, and in many cases scales down their vision, to fit within the constraints of the device they are targeting. We are turning that completely on its head. This allows game makers to scale up their vision.”

Stadia Games and Entertainment

Outside game developers like Ubisoft are critical to any game platform, but exclusive titles are also a key differentiator.

To stay competitive, Google has launched a game studio , with Raymond at its head. The company is also working with some external, independent developers to create titles that will be exclusive to Stadia.

Raymond’s first day with Google was March 11, so the company understandably isn’t talking about titles it develops in house, but Harrison did say the internal focus on game development will allow both Google developers and partners “to unlock the deep technical partnerships with Google.”

All of the titles, though, will launch at the 4k, 60 fps standard and will be upgradable to future high-end video specifications, including resolutions of 8k (eight times the resolution of high definition video) and 120 frames per second (making for a smoother video experience).

Another key to playing a game on Stadia is the controller. Google has introduced a Wi-Fi controller that it says will link directly to the game inside the company’s data center, rather than pairing with a device in the home. That, says Harrison, is key to smooth gameplay without any lag.

The controller will also integrate a Google Assistant button and have a built-in microphone, letting players interact vocally with both the game they’re playing and the Stadia platform. Additionally, there’s a “Share to YouTube” button, letting anyone stream or share a gameplay clip to any audience they choose—themselves, friends, or the world at large. And the controller will let players immediately access Google divisions, like YouTube, that can help them as they play without having to switch to a different device.

“Imagine you’re playing a game and you’re stuck,” say Harrison. “Historically, you would go to a second service. You’d probably Google a walk through on a different device or go on YouTube and watch someone playing through. Then you’d try to recreate that in the game. With Stadia, because YouTube is integrated into the platform, you’d say ‘Hey Stadia, how do I defeat this boss and it brings up the video straight away. … It integrates watching and playing at the same time.”

Stadia launch details

Gamers will have to wait until E3, the video game industry’s annual trade show in Los Angeles, in June or possibly later before they learn some crucial details about Stadia, including the price—specifically, whether Google will sell games on a per-title basis, like traditional retailers, or a Netflix-like, all you can stream model. (Harrison hints both will be an option, saying, “Our platform is very flexible and will enable developers to engage with their fans in a variety of ways.”)

The service will initially roll out to gamers in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe (including the U.K.) this year. Google says it plans to expand to other countries “as quickly as possible in 2020 and beyond.”

It’s also unclear, as of now, whether Stadia’s mobile and tablet compatibility will be limited to Android devices.

What is clear is the competitive threat Google presents to traditional gaming platforms. The company’s tremendous cash reserves could be used to lure game makers into striking deals to release titles first on Stadia, giving the platform a limited periods of exclusivity. Currently, Microsoft and Sony often battle for those exclusive windows.

That puts tremendous pressure on the three console makers, which are exploring the same technology. Sony currently offers PlayStation Now, giving players instant access to a library of 650 games (mostly older, catalog titles) for $99 annually. And Microsoft Microsoft will begin public trials of its take on game streaming later this year.

While Google certainly has high expectations for Stadia, Harrison says the platform’s purpose is not to drive others out of business. (Granted, any such admission would probably send a red flag to regulators who are already concerned about Google’s size.)

“We wouldn’t be having this conversation if it weren’t for the fantastic work of the games industry over the past 40 years,” he says “So we’re very respectful of the companies that brought us to this point. But Google has some very unique capabilities in the cloud—not just technology, but technology at scale and I think that’s really the difference.”",,fortune-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"Google Unveils Stadia, a Video Game Streaming Service That Could Threaten Xbox and PlayStation",Post,,

Many people reporting on this also stated that companies like Nintendo are trying to go down this route in the future. And what was my reaction? I've hated the idea from the very beginning. Maybe it's something we will have to get used to, but I loathe the idea of not having my games nor my system in my possession. The fact that a data center is doing everything for me and I only own my controller and maybe a ""digital copy"" (i.e. a pass/subscription) to my gaming experience really bothers me. I mean, I'm the type of gamer who loves to have physical copies of my games, much like I have physical copies of my books. I want to be able to form a library as a collector and as someone who primarily games by myself. I also want to own my own hardware and hate the idea of needing to be connected to the internet when I'm gaming. Now, I can understand the positives of going cloud -- it increases the number of people who can conceivably play your games, removes the need to create hardware for every individual person, and removes the need for physical media. In other words, everything becomes cheaper to make and you have a larger consumer base (or so it seems). But will this really be the revolution of gaming for everyone? Netflix is doing well, sure, but watching movies and playing games are two totally different experiences. There is a massive difference between watching something and interacting with it, being immersed into it, and being a subculture. Can cloud based systems of the future really cater to the gaming world? Or is this yet another experiment that will fail miserably, because it really doesn't understand how gamers think, interact, and understand the world of their hobby?

183665317989,3/24/2019,http://adamgdooley.tumblr.com/post/183665317989,"Google


Yesterday Google announced its long-anticipated streaming game platform, Stadia. In the news post we called it an “invasion” of gaming: this combination platform and delivery service has the potential to compete with consoles, PCs, and mobile games, all at once.

Google’s ambition is huge, but it’s appropriate to the task. The game industry as we know it is stagnating in terms of innovation, but its biggest corporate players are well-entrenched and experienced. If Stadia is to compete with the likes of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, it needs to nail three crucial elements when it launches later in 2019.

Get the Games

The most important piece in the gaming platform puzzle is, naturally, the games. Consoles live and die on their game selection, and securing exclusive and desirable titles (either from third-party publishers or developers owned by the console manufacturer) is the best way to make sure you’re going to succeed.

With Stadia, Google is already on the right track. Its best move is undoubtedly becoming a publisher itself. Google hired Jade Raymond, formerly a game producer and studio head at mega-publishers EA and Ubisoft, to lead its own game studio. Stadia Games and Entertainment, a separate but linked company under Alphabet’s ever-widening umbrella, will be developing its own games for the Stadia platform as well as wooing independent developers to bring their games onboard.
Google’s Stadia studio, under Ubisoft and EA veteran Raymond, will woo developers. Google
Another good move: announcing Stadia at the yearly Game Developer Conference, instead of at the upcoming Google I/O show or E3. By introducing Stadia specifically to game developers and publishers, including quite a lot of time showing off the unique design flexibility  of its remote Linux- and Vulkan-powered hardware, surely ignited the imagination of a lot of game makers. Today, the day after the announcement, you can bet there are game directors and developers scrambling to meet with Google’s Stadia team at GDC, desperate to check out the platform and get games on at launch.

Stadia isn’t the first gaming platform to use a 100% remote streaming setup: the ill-fated OnLive eventually became Sony’s PlayStation Now, NVIDIA’s GeForce Now is currently in beta, and Shadow allows for a more techy, individualistic approach. Microsoft is almost certainly going to go into streaming in a big way with the next Xbox, and rumors suggest that Verizon and Amazon are looking into it as well.
Stadia already works with the industry’s most popular software tools. Google
But Stadia is the first streaming system to be built with streaming in mind from the ground up and upon the massive power of Google’s data centers and money. Demonstrating deep hooks in Chrome and YouTube (to capture the Twitch audience), powerful new ways to play split-screen and asynchronous multiplayer, and baked-in support for massively popular developer tools like Unreal Engine, Unity, CryEngine, and Havok are all smart moves for a new platform.

It means that not only will developers be able to port their existing projects to Stadia’s hardware easily, but they’ll also be able to create entirely new types of games that are only possible with access to Stadia’s web, streaming, and scalability functions.
DOOM Eternal is the only upcoming game confirmed to already be running on Stadia. Google
During the GDC presentation, Google demonstrated partner projects with Ubisoft, Bethesda, 2K, Square-Enix, Tangent Games, Tequila Works, and Q-Games, but at the time of writing only Id Software’s DOOM Eternal has been confirmed for release on Stadia. Of course, Google can still mess up its initial relationship by limiting developers with restrictive platform rules, or by simply asking them for too much of a cut of their profits. Which is a nice segue into…

The Price is Right

That is on the low side. That's not a breakeven, because if you go the hardware route, you have to buy all games separately.

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » I haven't tried a game streaming service, so I'm kind of curious about the latency and speed of light issues that people were talking about. Is it something that makes tons of games simply unplayable for anyone who's ever gone into a settings menu, or does the latency just mean that you maybe don't get a good experience with the twitchiest games, like competitive shooters and fighting games? Armchair seemed to suggest that this would mostly only be useful for turn based games, but people indicated they were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey well enough, and it seems like PSNow has been doing it since 2014.

183508031458,3/16/2019,http://joshuajacksonlyblog.tumblr.com/post/183508031458,"GPU-based cryptocurrency miners have taken a beating throughout this bear market — just ask NVIDIA. However, users with spare GPUs may soon be able to put their ineffective mining hardware to another profitable use: renting rendering power to those looking to experience quality PC gaming on an underpowered computer. 

As reported by TechCrunch, Vectordash is looking to allow people with underpowered rigs not meant for gaming — such as Apple computers — to experience quality PC gaming with the help of individuals willing to rent their spare power for cloud rendering. This means that, in theory, even those with a Macbook Air could game at 4K resolution and 60 frames-per-second, given their internet bandwidth is capable of handling that amount of data.

If this sounds too good to be true, it’s not. Cloud rendering itself is nothing particularly new, so this idea is far from half-baked. Sony launched a cloud rendering service in PlayStation Now years ago — though it never really took off. Nevertheless, the company proved that cloud rendering is a viable option for gaming going forward.

Vectordash’s service will apparently run users $28 per month for cloud rendering capabilities. On the other side of the deal, GPU renters stand to make about $0.60 per day — which isn’t life-changing money for anyone who has the dough to throw at high-powered GPUs. However, the ability to put less-than-profitable meant-for-mining GPUs to work for another reason may help those who have been beaten down by both a bear market and dramatically more powerful ASIC mining rigs.



The key for Vectordash, of course, is offering payments for renters that are competitively priced with cryptocurrency mining returns — which shouldn’t be too difficult, given that GPU mining returns are currently negligible.

What do you think about Vectordash and cloud rendering PC games? Do you have GPUs you bought for cryptocurrency mining that you no longer use? Let us know in the comments below!

183703853870,3/25/2019,http://brucedayne.tumblr.com/post/183703853870,"http://brucedayne.com Apple unveils Apple Arcade subscription gaming service 

Apple announced a premium game subscription, Apple Arcade, for its App Store, bundling together paid iPhone and iPad games that consumers can play for a monthly fee.

Confirming rumors, the service fee will be divided among the game developers, based on how much time gamers spend playing each game.

Subscriptions are popular in games these days. Sony offers its PlayStation Plus on the PS4 for $10 a month, and Sony also offers PlayStation Now cloud gaming on the PC and PS4 for $20 a month. Microsoft has its Xbox Live Gold service for $10 a month on the Xbox One and Xbox 360, and it also offers its Xbox Game Pass on the Xbox One for $10 a month.

On the streaming front, Amazon Prime gives you access to Twitch Prime, which otherwise costs $13 a month on the PC and Mac. Utomik also offers $6 a month service for instantly accessible games. And EA is offering its EA Access service for $5 a month. EA also offers Origin Access for $5 a month.

Subscriptions are a good way to get reliable revenue at a time when free-to-play games carry so much risk. Google is likely to charge some kind of subscription fee for its Stadia cloud gaming platform, but Google has declined to comment on that so far.

“We want to make gaming even better,” said Tim Cook, Apple CEO, at the company’s press briefing today.

Ann Tai, marketing manager for the App Store, said there are 1 billion people who have downloaded games from the store. There are 300,000 games available. Besides paid and free-to-play games, ther will now be a new subscription category.

“Competing with free is hard,” Tai said.

You won’t need an expensive gaming PC or a dedicated game console. Instead, you’ll just need access to Google’s Chrome browser to instantly play games on a phone, tablet, PC, or TV. It’s a bold vision for where gaming is heading, and Google hopes its Stadia cloud streaming service will make it a reality. Google may have just unveiled the future of gaming at the Game Developers Conference (GDC), but it’s a future the company has left us knowing very little about. Google’s Stadia controller. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge At the heart of Google’s Stadia cloud streaming service are YouTube and Chrome. Google is leveraging YouTube to lean heavily on the popularity of gaming clips and creators who regularly stream games to millions of people on services like Twitch. These communities and games like Fortnite have turned into virtual places where kids hang out to chat, play, and watch streamers. It’s a big business, too. Fortnite made around $2.4 billion alone last year, and one of the most popular streamers makes more than $500,000 a month . The Stadia premise is that you’ll be able to watch a clip of a game and then instantly play it or even launch to the very same point in the game of the clip you were watching. Streamers will be able to create lobbies for fans to join and play with them on YouTube, and Stadia will support instant clipping to the video service. This is a game console running in the cloud and built for the YouTube generation, and it’s Google’s big push here. Chrome also plays a big role as Google’s dominant web browser. Stadia will only be available through Chrome, Chromecast, and on Android devices initially. Google has promised more browsers in the future, but it’s not clear when this will arrive. Google only demonstrated the service on its own devices, and there was no mention of iOS support through a dedicated app or Apple’s Safari mobile browser. Google’s Project Stream test. Google has some significant hurdles to overcome if it wants to dominate gaming for the next generation, though. The biggest among them is getting games on its platform. Google showed a single new title, Doom Eternal , running on Stadia, and it promised that more than 100 game studios already have dev kits. Google even unveiled its own Stadia Games and Entertainment studio to create Stadia-exclusive titles, but it didn’t mention any details on what games it will be building. Google is using Linux as the operating system powering its hardware on the server side. That means game developers will need to port their games to Stadia, and you won’t be able to bring games you already own like some other cloud gaming services (Nvidia’s GeForce Now or Shadow). Google is partnering with Unreal and Unity and even middleware companies like Havok, but there’s going to be some lifting involved for developers to get games onto Stadia. Google needs to convince big publishers to sign up, but it failed to detail how much it costs to develop, publish, and run games on Stadia. We don’t even know how much the service will cost for consumers or when it’s launching — only that it will arrive in some form in 2019. Will it be subscription-based? Can you own your games in the cloud? These are important questions that Google needs to answer, and it skipped past them yesterday to promise more details in the summer. It feels like Google has rushed to beat some self-imposed GDC deadline to court developer interest here, and it’s likely why the company was only able to show a handful of games yesterday. Inside a Google data center. Economics aside, Google also stealthily avoided the big questions around existing game streaming services: internet connectivity. Google is using its own compression technology to stream games in 1080p or 4K to devices, and some of the typical latency will be reduced by having the game client and server on the same machine. Still, you’ll need a reliable and active internet connection to access Stadia, and Google is recommending a connection of “approximately 25 Mbps” for 1080p resolution at 60 fps. In an interview with Kotaku , Google Stadia boss Phil Harrison says, “[W]e will be able to get to 4K but only raise that bandwidth to about 30 Mbps.” That means the average fixed broadband connection in the US, currently around 96 Mbps by some estimates, will be sufficient, but if you’re living in a state without broadband coverage or relying on rural internet speeds then you’ll be stuck waiting on the Federal Communications Commission to raise the minimum rural broadband speed standard to 25 Mbps. You’ll also need a connection without broadband caps because if you’re going to be playing games a lot, then it will soon eat into data limits. We don’t know the exact bitrates of Stadia just yet, but watching a regular HD Netflix stream uses around 3GB per hour , and this more than doubles for 4K streams. Speeds won’t cover the latency aspect, though. This is key to any game streaming service. While services like Netflix can download and buffer the fixed content you’re streaming, a game service relies on picking up your controller movements and relaying them in real time back and forth between you and the server you’re playing on. This means the closer to the server you’re playing on, the better, and the fewer hops through internet traffic, the better. Google has a solid advantage here due to its cloud infrastructure, but if you’re not near a big city where Google’s data centers are located, then you won’t get the most ideal experience. Google is addressing part of this by connecting its Stadia controller directly to the server you’re playing on over Wi-Fi, but it has no control over the thousands of ISPs and how they route traffic to its data centers. Google’s Stadia service is also entirely cloud-based, which means no offline play. While you might typically sync a few Netflix shows to your phone or tablet because you know your LTE connectivity sucks, you’ll need a constant connection to Stadia to play games on the go. 5G will certainly help here, but only partially and not anytime soon. Google’s servers are more powerful than an Xbox One X. Photo by James Bareham / The VergeGoogle also revealed that its servers will be powered by a custom AMD GPU that will deliver 10.7 teraflops of power, which is more than the 4.2 teraflops of the PS4 Pro and the 6 teraflops of power on the Xbox One X. This graphical power is impressive but largely irrelevant. The end result of actual gameplay will rely entirely on your internet connection to Stadia. Google will compress the image from its servers to your client, resulting in a loss of image quality. We don’t know the exact bitrates that Google will use for Stadia, but if you’ve ever watched a 4K version of a Netflix show, you’ll know the image quality isn’t as good as a Blu-ray copy. The same will apply for Stadia, and how you notice it will depend on your internet connection and the device you’re using to access Stadia. Smaller screens will make the drop in image quality less noticeable, and more internet bandwidth will give you a higher bitrate and thus a higher-quality image. This will all vary from game title to title, and Google hasn’t shown enough variation of games to really give an understanding of how well Stadia will perform. Eurogamer’s Digital Foundry was able to test Stadia, but the testing was limited to Assassin’s Creed Odyssey instead of a demanding title like a first-person shooter that requires quick player response time or fast-moving action games where artifacts are much more obvious. All of this makes Stadia look like an early beta for what will be part of the future of gaming. Google has hired a lot of industry talent for this ambitious project. Phil Harrison, a former Sony and Microsoft executive, is leading the Stadia charge, and Jade Raymond, who has previously worked at Sony, Electronic Arts, and Ubisoft, is heading up the company’s first-party games. Xbox Live Arcade creator Greg Canessa is also working on Stadia, alongside former Xbox gaming partnerships lead Nate Ahearn. All of this experience should help Google in its cloud gaming fight. Sony already runs PlayStation Now. Image: SonySony already streams PlayStation games to its consoles and PCs via its PlayStation Now service. Sony acquired game streaming service Gaikai to turn it into PlayStation Now, and it even acquired rival OnLive only to shut it down. Microsoft is also planning its own xCloud game streaming service , which it demonstrated recently , with public trials set to start later this year. Sony and Microsoft’s approaches aren’t cloud-native like Google’s, and they don’t require developers to port their games or rebuild them for their cloud streaming service. Both companies are using console hardware in server blades. That’s a benefit for now as both Sony and Microsoft can offer big game libraries without needing developers to change anything. Google’s ambitious effort will require more heavy lifting from developers, but Google has the longer-term advantage of being able to switch out its hardware with ease in the future and implement changes that don’t affect legacy console hardware. Amazon also looks like it will be a big cloud gaming competitor to Google, and Nvidia also streams games. Even Valve is expanding its Steam Link game-streaming feature to allow you to stream your Steam games from a PC to anywhere through the Steam Link hardware or the Steam Link app. Sony, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google will be the key players in any cloud gaming war. Sony has the games and PlayStation Now, Microsoft can leverage its Azure data centers and Xbox Game Pass for xCloud, and Amazon can lean on its cloud dominance, Prime, and its massively popular Twitch service to entice gamers. Google has some fierce competition, but it looks like this cloud gaming war is just getting started.",,FUBHO,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,32079568,,,

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.",,lethal-cuddles,United Kingdom,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,
183698884314,3/25/2019,http://helloarungautamblog.tumblr.com/post/183698884314,"Google’s vision for the future of gaming is one I can’t wait to get my hands on.



I’m not old enough to have memories with consoles like the Nintendo 64 or Saga Saturn, but I’ve been a lover of video games since I can remember. My very first gaming system was the Gameboy Color, followed by the PlayStation 2 which I sunk waaay too many hours into as kid. Those were followed by the likes of the OG Nintendo DS, PSP Go, PS3, Xbox 360, etc. In other words, I really like video games. And honestly, who wouldn’t? They’re engaging, exciting, and one of the best forms of entertainment we have access to.

Like probably ever gamer out there, I was really excited to hear what Google had to talk about at its GDC press conference this past Wednesday. That conference is where Google announced its new game streaming service Stadia, and if it works out the way Google’s saying it will, I may never buy another console ever again.

We have a big guide talking all about what Stadia is, but here’s the quick rundown for anyone that may have missed the announcement — Stadia is a new service from Google that allows you to play video games by streaming them similar to how you watch shows on Netflix or YouTube. Because the games are streamed and not download files or on a disc, you can play big, AAA titles like Assassin’s Creed and DOOM on a computer, smartphone, tablet, or a TV using a Chromecast. As long as you have access to a reliable internet connection, you’ll be able to play.



The Stadia Controller

Google says this will make games more accessible, and for the most part, it’s right.

Before you can start playing anything, you need to either buy a console or gaming PC. Flagship systems like the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X cost around $400, and even if you go for something more affordable like the PS4 Slim or Xbox One S, that’s still $200 - $300 you need to cough up. And, once you do have a console, there are the joys of waiting for games to install and downloading updates for them. With Stadia, the idea is that you can start playing instantly on any device you want with nothing to download, update, or install.

To be fair, Stadia is far from the first service of its kind. NVIDIA GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Vortex are all trying to do the same thing — not to mention that Microsoft’s also expected to announce something similar at E3 with Project xCloud.

The potential Google has with Stadia is unfathomable.

But even so, Stadia still has my interest more than anything we’ve seen. Google proved during its Project Stream beta late last year that it has the technology to make game streaming an enjoyable experience, and it’s only gotten better since then. Google claims Stadia will offer gameplay at 4K and 60 FPS at launch, essentially giving it the performance of an Xbox One X. Later on down the road, Stadia will support 8K at 120 FPS. This next generation of consoles could do 8K at 120 FPS, but there’s the age-old issue of needing to buy new hardware to get the best performance. With Stadia, you essentially have access to a system that’s constantly improving without you having to go out and buy a new console every 5 years or so.

So, what’s the catch?



There’s still a lot Google’s not telling us. We don’t know how much data Stadia’s going to eat up while playing, what games will be available, or even how much it’ll cost. Will users need to spend $60 on titles as one-time purchases, or will Google offer a subscription-based model where you get access to a collection of games for a recurring fee? Right now, we simply do not know.

Those are some big questions that need to be answered, but if the library’s there and the pricing model is fair, Microsoft and Sony are going to have a tough time making an argument as to why players should spend hundreds of dollars on their next consoles.

I’m interested to see what the PS5 and Xbox Two bring to the table, but for the first time in as long as I can remember, I don’t think I’ll want to rush out and buy them to replace my current consoles. Stadia could end up being a complete dumpsterfire and not at all what we’re expecting, but if Google manages to deliver on the promises it’s making — which I think it will — it really does have potential to change the gaming industry as we know it.

183565813245,3/19/2019,http://zacks-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183565813245,"Alphabet’s GOOGL division Google is set to revolutionize the gaming industry with its concept of game streaming service.

The search giant is geared up to roll out its streaming game service at 2019 Game Developers Conference (“GDC”). The move will mark as one of the company’s major steps in the gaming space. Additionally, Google focuses on leveraging its robust cloud capabilities to add efficiency to its soon-to-be-launched gaming service.

Per sources, the company is about to unveil a console hardware — Yeti. The device is likely to act as a streaming box that will help in connecting the service with TV. The feature will enable gamers to stream their content on TV.

Notably, the service rules out the requirement of high-end gaming devices and will be compatible with any desktop, laptop, smartphone as well as TV.

We believe that the company will gain momentum among gamers with its latest plans.

Intense Gaming Competition

Gaming industry is booming on the back of higher consumer spending on video games across the world. Per a IDC report, the industry has generated revenues worth $136 billion in 2018.

Further, the report suggests that the industry is growing at a rate of 15% every year, which presents immense opportunities. We believe that Google with its cloud-based game streaming service will be able to rapidly penetrate this booming market.

However, growth potential in the market is alluring enough to attract other tech giants like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA and Sony SNE among others. We note that these companies are leaving no stone unturned to bolster their presence in the gaming space.

The e-commerce giant has unveiled an all-in-one toolkit at the ongoing GDC. The toolkit is targeted toward game developers and comprises back-end services, SDKs, analytics and monetization tools. Apart from the latest launch, the company already offers a huge game streaming portfolio via Twitch.

Meanwhile, Microsoft owns the huge video gaming brand, Xbox. It is planning to develop a streaming box that will offer streaming services for video games on Xbox consoles with the support of its cloud platform, Azure.

Further, the company introduced a development kit called Game Stack that includes services like Azure, Xbox Live, App Center, PlayFab and others at GDC. Additionally, it is gearing up to launch trials of dubbed XCloud, its cloud streaming service for games.

Further, Sony has its cloud gaming subscription service namely — PlayStation Now— that streams a huge library of video games on PlayStation 4 and PC.

NVIDIA’s GeForce GPU includes a library of 400 games. The service works on its own Android-based Shield console that is compatible with TVs, Macs and PCs.

We note that strong endeavors of these companies will continue to intensify the gaming arena.

Google’s Aggressive Stance

Google’s upcoming streaming service seems to be the commercial version of its Project Stream that was launched in 2018. It is a subscription-based streaming service for AAA video games that usually includes graphically-rich content.

Further, the company is aggressively looking for deals with developers to release interesting games on its platform. Its partnership with UbiSoft Entertainment, a video game publisher, has facilitated the streaming of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey via Chrome on Project Stream.

Google has appointed the former Playstation and Xbox executive — Phil Harrison — as Vice President. Moreover, its vast base of developers is a major positive.

We believe Google’s cost-effective game streaming service and growing initiatives to strengthen footprint in the gaming industry is likely to fortify its market position.

I guarantee you they aren't. Well, Nintendo, maybe. Sony and Microsoft have been gearing up to do the exact same thing already, and just like Google, Microsoft is already a big player in the cloud computing industry with Azure and has been getting ready to make the same play and transition into services alongside traditional hardware for the last couple of years (see: Gamepass, Mixer). Sony looks to be in a more precarious position, but they have just expanded their Playstation Now service with dedicated servers to cover most of Europe, likely for the exact same reason, so they know what the deal is. They don't have the same kind of cloud and video chops that Google and Microsoft does, though. Google honestly seems to be in the worst position of them all to me because they'll get to be first (unless Microsoft wants to soft launch at E3), with all of the disadvantages that come with that, and then they'll have two highly competitive adversaries in the same space after growing pains with a much bigger library, exclusive games, and dedicated hardware while they're cloud only. It will probably be hard to get developers to make the kind of games that take advantage of any of the elastic computing they have on offer for the next generation too, as long as they have to launch on traditional consoles as well. Apart from infrastructure, it's hard for me to see what kind of edge they have in comparison to Microsoft and Sony. Maybe their video compression if ML plays a part in that. I do agree that it is the beginning of the end, though, it's just that it would happen with or without Google. Microsoft for sure was gearing up to do this anyway, and with it, force Sony to do the same. I'm more surprised we haven't heard from Amazon yet.",,so_witty_username_v2,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Even if this Google Stadia takes off in the future and it’s as smooth as Google is promising or as smooth as the people who tested Google Project Stream say it is, and people will no longer need to buy new expensive home consoles anymore or no longer need to keep upgrading their PCs, I can still play Switch games on the go without needing a connection. I think stuff like Google Stadia and Microsoft xCloud is why Sony is looking to a post console future...but I can still find room for a portable non-connected device like the Switch. PS5 and Xbox Two have lost a lot of hype with me seeing where Google is taking it and news on Microsoft’s own service. Surprisingly enough I’m starting to be a little more worried for Sony, they don’t exactly have the massive infrastructures for big networks like Google and Microsoft has...what we got so far is the PlayStation Now service that isn’t as smooth or seemless as people were hoping it to be. I’m really starting to see this post-console future and Netflix like environments for gaming that big companies are starting to do moving forward, and I don’t think Sony has what it takes to run a successful smooth network like what Google and Microsoft have in place.

I know illustrating the other companies are evil doesn't make Google any less evil, I just bring it up because we're spending t ns of time on the merits of Google as a company. We being a large enough amount of people that it dominates large swathes of the thread, but obviously not everyone. To addendum Delduwath's breakdown, I don't even particularly care about the service or tech at all in the context of this discussion. Time will tell on that, for me. I'm fascinated by the direction the discussion has taken re: evil corporate overlords and Google specifically. It's an interesting forum for this discussion because, hyperbolically, we all have blood on our hands. Unless you're playing only indie games on your Linux setup using the videocard you made on your grandpappy's farm growing up, we're all suckling at the corporate tech giant teat. So I'm curious to understand all of that -- do people think Google is just The Worst? If so, by what metrics? Are you biased towards Microsoft or Sony because you have a lot of videogame happy experiences to offset their crazy anti-consumer behavior? Or, did I just miss the days in the megathreads of yore where we spent years debating the ethical behavior of the existant tech giants in the industry and we're all just kind of tired of it now and want to yell at the new guy? Fiatil on March 26 ====================::==================== Quote: : » Quote: : » Quote: : » Was there any actual claim about partial or distributed GPU loads? I very much got the impression that for your average game, a single rendered viewpoint gets a single blade to itself. That's why there is a tflop cap for a rendered scene, and why they had to resort to gimmicks like splitscreen or multiple cameras to get beyond that cap on a single screen. One GPU per player is expensive but not clearly so when you compare to the console space. I mean Sony has managed to sell 90 million PS4s that spend most of their time collecting dust. Whats a million or so that will see much more use to start a server farm? The answer to your question is Sony sold them. As in, they received a profit from the hardware (or at least broke even) on top of licensing and other things. And those 90 million GPUs are distributed worldwide, their operation paid for again by the end user via utilities. Google is proposing subsidizing the hardware cost (I assume, they haven't released pricing or cost of entry), which is not insignificant. Neither is the cost of having a million 100+ watt GPUs running (given the idea that a million+ concurrent users is not an absurd goal for this service.) Someone's gotta foot that 100 megawatt electric bill. Shared GPU loads would be a huge boon, but as of now they're impossible given current virtual architecture. Not only did they sell PS4s, they have the standard cut of all digitally downloaded software, which gives them a HUGE revenue stream locked into their consoles. They are basically selling boxes that print money, as long as people buy them. Google is going to take some cut as well so I don't see how that part is any different. There's 90 million PS4s out there but the vast majority aren't turned on at the same time. Hell after seven years the majority are probably sitting in a closet at this point. Google can easily support the same modern, active playerbase as the PS4 with a fraction of the GPUs over lifetime simply because not everyone is using them at once. They don't even need to get into load balancing/sharing which their presentation demonstrated zero evidence for and many points agianst. I mean this stuff isn't even groundbreaking. The problem with onlive! wasn't that they didn't have the severs, it was no-one wanting the service. PSnow is just blades of PS3s (and I guess some PS4s) and its also making a lot more money on the shareholder reports than you'd think based on zero talk about it online. Microsoft is setting up xCloud the same way. Latency, pricing, and consumer interest will be tricky, but just setting up enough hardware to give each active play session its own GPU isn't by compare. rahkeesh2000 on March 26",,rahkeesh2000,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,[Google Stadia] Stream all your games anywhere! 16,,,

183591690632,3/20/2019,http://immedtech.tumblr.com/post/183591690632,"There’s a good chance we’ll remember Google’s Stadia announcement as a landmark moment in gaming. In one fell swoop, Google laid out its plans for an ambitious game streaming service that goes far beyond anything we’ve ever seen before. Stadia promises unparalleled graphical power, near-instant access and the ability to play the latest titles on almost any screen. As Google’s announcement went on, the future came into focus – a world where the frustration of modern consoles didn’t exist, and games flowed freely as water.

Obviously, plenty of questions still remain. We don’t know what Stadia will cost, or how well it’ll perform with millions of players slamming Google’s servers (the “Project Stream” beta was solid, at least). But after plenty of false starts in game streaming, Stadia feels like the bold swing that could make it truly take off. That might seem surprising, coming from a company that hasn’t has much experience with games. But historically many of the biggest shifts in the industry came from newcomers: Sony proved CDs were a viable upgrade to cartridges with the PlayStation; and Microsoft showed the importance of a robust online service with Xbox Live. Each of those companies tapped into their expertise to shift the gaming landscape, so it makes sense that Google would be the one to nail streaming. It requires a deep understanding of the internet and experience in delivering complex services to a wide variety of devices.

For years, streaming games over the internet has seemed like a pipe dream. OnLive made a huge splash a decade ago, only to burn out a few years later (Sony picked up its patent scraps). GaiKai was a direct competitor, which Sony snapped up and used its technology to build PlayStation Now and Remote Play. More recently, we’ve seen the likes of NVIDIA take a stab with GeForce Now – a solid service, but one that’s perpetually been in beta. There are also smaller companies, like Blade and Parsec, that are trying to make their mark. Microsoft, meanwhile, says it’s working on its own game streaming solution, Project xCloud, which we’re expecting more details about at E3.

While all of these services basically do the same thing (let you play titles running on remote servers over the internet), Stadia’s scope is on an entirely different level. Google says it’ll be powered by servers running custom CPUs and AMD GPUs capable of 10.7 teraflops, on par with NVIDIA’s GTX 1080 Ti. In comparison, the Xbox One X, the most powerful console today, has six teraflops. The company claims Stadia will support up to 4K HDR at 60 frames per second, something that only gaming PCs can achieve today. It’s also eyeing 8K 120+ FPS down the line, specs which no game supports today. To deal with more demanding games, Stadia will be able to use multiple servers and GPUs seamlessly. And it will also rely on server-class SSDs, which means your games and levels will load faster than any console. Basically, you won’t have to worry about specs anymore.

Of course, raw power doesn’t mean much if your gameplay is laggy because the servers are far away, but Google says it’ll have 7,500 server locations around the world. We haven’t seen server stats from earlier streaming services, but even OnLive at the height of its popularity couldn’t deploy data centers as easily Google. That’s also a sign that smaller companies like Blade and Parsec will have a hard time competing.

Google is also making its service a much more web-connected experience than consoles. Press a button on the new Stadia controller, and you’ll quickly start streaming your experience on YouTube gaming. Another button lets you access Google Assistant, which can automatically point you to YouTube videos to help you get through a tough level. Google says Stadia will also lead to lag-free multiplayer matches, since all of the networking complexity happens on its cloud. And there’s another surprising advantage: the service could also help us relive the days when we spent hours playing Goldeneye on crowded couches.. Many modern titles are too demanding to support co-operative multiplayer on a single TV, but that’s not problem for Stadia’s cloud processing.

The Stadia controller is unique in another respect: It connects to the internet over Wi-Fi, giving it direct communication with the server. That’s a smart way to reduce input lag, a common problem with every game streaming service so far. Previously, you’d press a button on a controller and it would go through a local device, make its way to a server, and you’d see the result when it appears on your screen.

Stadia appears to address most of the problems inherent with game streaming, while also offering significant advantages over today’s consoles. With its large server footprint and powerful hardware, Google says you’ll be able to start a game in under five seconds. You won’t have to worry about downloading, installing and updating anything. (I can’t count the number of times when I’ve had 30 minutes to play something, only to be thwarted by a huge update.) Its expandable graphics means it could scale to whatever quality you need. And of course, there’s no giant box to deal with – all you need is an internet connection and a device that runs Chrome. As Google demonstrated at GDC, you’ll be able to continue a single play session across multiple devices easily.

Perhaps most importantly, Google seems to be throwing everything it has behind Stadia, something we haven’t seen with a game streaming service since PlayOn. They’ve even hired industry veteran Jade Raymond to head up their first-party studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment. Hopefully, Stadia will encourage competitors like NVIDIA and Microsoft to step up with their own offerings. While there’s still plenty left up in the air, Stadia is the boldest play we’ve seen yet for the next generation of gaming.

Yeah, I'm not sure who would subscribe to this gaming service. No Apple hardware justifies paying a monthly fee for games, IMO. But the fact they compared the power of the A12X to an Xbox One may be a sign of things to come. If Apple were serious about games, they would release a dedicated TV model because the current design really cannot accommodate any AAA game. They need to bundle a pair of controllers and give it a descent amount of storage. That'd be at least 1TB, and given the price of SSD's of that size, a fusion drive would be in order, which would have consequences on the size of the box. Or they may offer an optional ""gaming kit"" that would include controllers and an external USB-C drive (SSD or fusion). You can't really make a small media box and pretend it's a game console. The current TV shows it doesn't work. Given the current games the 4K AppleTv is adequate if they have a streaming solution like Google’s New Stadia or Sony’s PlayStation Now service. But the controller is wholly inadequate, even if they somehow make it work with an iPhone or iPad. They need dedicated controllers. I don't see Apple developing a game streaming service. They're all in the ""on device"" idea, and they keep touting the power of their AX SoC.

183550651178,3/18/2019,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/183550651178,"Google is expected to reveal some kind of gaming news at the Game Developers Conference on March 19. Exactly what that will be remains to be seen, although some kind of cloud gaming service and/or hardware has been the suspicion since the company first teased an announcement for GDC 2019.

This being Google, it could be major news–cloud gaming is a big part of gaming’s future, and a massive company getting involved has the potential to shake things up for the industry. With all of that in mind, we’ve rounded up some of the essential information regarding both Google’s event and some things to know about cloud gaming. We’ll update this once the news from Google, whatever it turns out to be, is announced.

Google GDC Livestream And Time

Provided you’re eager to find out what Google is up to as soon as possible, you’ll be able to watch a Google keynote livestream of the event. It takes place on March 19 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 5 PM GMT (4 AM AET on March 20).

As for what to expect, Google recently shared a teaser video showing off various environments. It also said the event would “unveil Google’s vision for the future of gaming.”

Why Is Cloud Gaming A Big Deal?

Cloud gaming isn’t new by any means; PlayStation Now, for instance, has been around for a while. But we’re finally reaching the point at which it stands to become a more significant component of how games are distributed. That doesn’t necessarily mean cloud gaming will replace consoles and dedicated hardware, as it could be a matter of complementing those things. To get you up to speed, we’ve put together an explainer on why cloud gaming is the future.

Jade Raymond Is (Probably) Involved

Just ahead of GDC, Jade Raymond announced that she has joined Google as a vice president. We don’t yet know exactly what Raymond–who is best known for her work as a producer on Assassin’s Creed–will be doing, but it seems fair to assume that she’ll be helping to spearhead whatever this “future of gaming” is that Google has in mind.

Who’s The Competition?

As noted above, PlayStation Now already exists, and Microsoft just recently showcased its xCloud streaming technology, with Forza Horizon 4 being played on a phone. Microsoft also announced plans to begin public testing this year. To help you keep track of all this, we’ve assembled a list of the top companies in the cloud gaming space.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"Google's GDC Gaming News: Date, Time, How To Watch, And What We Know",Post,,
183579531099,3/20/2019,http://businessliveme.tumblr.com/post/183579531099,"(Bloomberg) — Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. shares slid after Alphabet Inc.’s Google outlined a major push into video games with a streaming service called Stadia.

Nintendo dropped as much as 4.6 percent and Sony declined 4.5 percent Wednesday, the biggest intraday drop for both stocks in six weeks. Stadia lets developers put games on a streaming platform that will allow players to access the action through the web, skipping expensive consoles or personal computers, Google announced at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.

The game industry’s business model of creating a hardware platform, such as Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo’s Switch, and then charging publishers for the right to access it has come under pressure in recent years. That’s happened as many casual gamers turn to free-to-play mobile titles.

“There is no doubt this service makes life even more difficult for established platforms,” Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors Pte, said in a note to clients. “Google will help further fragment the gaming market which is already coming under pressure by big games which have adopted the mobile gaming business model of giving the titles away for free in hope of generating in-game content sales.”

The Japanese companies have responded by creating subscription services and offering content other than games, but Google’s push into the $180 billion industry threatens the longstanding hardware model. The search giant however not only has to provide a smooth lag-free experience, it must also convince publishers to bring their marquee titles.

Sony has already rolled out its own streaming service PlayStation Now, which was released in 2014. But its streaming technology and limited investment in data centers has held back the service, with some users complaining about lag times. Asumi Maeda, a spokeswoman for Sony Interactive Entertainment, said “the game industry heating up is something that should make players happy.” A Nintendo spokesman declined to comment.

“Technology should adapt to people, not the other way around,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said at the event. “We are dead serious about making technology accessible for everyone.”

Google wouldn’t say how much it will charge users, or whether it will be funded through advertising like most of its other businesses. The service will launch later this year, the company said, without announcing partnerships with the top-tier game developers.

Stadia runs through the company’s YouTube video-streaming platform and takes advantage of Google’s extensive network of data centers. With its presentation, Google drove home the point that its technical tools alone would make the future of gaming services work. It repeatedly mentioned the advantage of its cloud-computing power and YouTube, suggesting the service is designed to bring more users to those units — two areas where investors are looking for sales growth beyond advertising.

“This is only the start,” said Karol Severin, co-founder of MIDiA Research. “The tech majors Microsoft, Google and Amazon will be the real winners creating synergies with their existing entertainment ecosystems and leveraging cloud infrastructure and high content budgets.”

I'm comparing it to local gaming. The ultimate goal is for streaming gaming to be indistinguishable from local gaming. Psnow is not that. I doubt either google or xcloud will be that. Psnow should be considered the lowest rung of the ladder that streaming services are shooting for. Doing exactly what sony has done is not progressing anything. What we have seen is a video from a service that is months away from the testing phase, a video we don't even know if was actually the service running or not. The only point I was making was that there is really nothing to base anything on at this time. It very well could suck, but this would be like basing judgement of a game on an alpha version. I personally view something at this stage as little more than a proof of concept video. Ok and I certainly agree that PSNow when compared to a workable solution for local gaming would be the bare minimum. It's not that great and likely never can be as good as local gaming, just like video streaming can never be as good as physical media just due to the natural laws of nature. I also don't think it's fair to judge the end product from this, but I think MS is getting the flak they are getting because they had a big flashy presentation and lots of talk when you have Nvidia, Google, and Sony working in the background launching and betaing projects to the public. Honestly, if MS launched a beta when they were ready then we would having a lot of talk. Instead it feels and sounds a lot more like marketing just to keep people interested in their future offerings and combat the early competitors rather then having a viable product now. As I business I understand that, however as a consumer who doesn't like to be strung along. I'm less forgiving.",,michaelmikado,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Pushing graphics and physics on games if you're running off their platform. If you're into streaming, you can easily stream onto YouTube. Split screen is made much easier to do in their environment. Latency shouldn't be an issue because you're not pinging a remote server. You're going over the Google backbone not exposed to the public Internet, so network latency if anything would be better especially for multiplayer games.

No matter how good the internet becomes in the next five to 50 years, local hardware will likely always be a thing. The question is: how will Valve react to this? Back in 2013 Gabe already spoke about it and said he's not a fan. >Newell said that cloud gaming is great for caching and saving on network resources, but ignores the fundamentals of IP costs. ""There's always this 'let's ignore the fact that you have this network cost,'"" he said. ""Cloud gaming works until it becomes successful, at which point it falls over from its own success. As soon as everyone starts using a continuous network connection to get its applications, consumer IP pricing is going to go through the roof."" >He also said that latency is a problem with the service in that it puts compensation for it at the center of the network instead of on the edge where he thinks it belongs. ""We believe that latency sensitivity is going to increase in the future,"" Newell said. ""The ability to do local high-speed processing will become more important than it is right now... We actually think there is going to be a bunch of hardware in the future where you have more sensitivity than a human does to latency and putting that functionality at the center of the network will actually be impossible."" >In the end, Newell said he will continue to be skeptical of the whole process. ""If you really just want to have a standard client out there that's not a full-blown game engine, there are much better approaches than sending video."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=PeYxKIDGh8I https://www.shacknews.com/article/77747/valve-ceo-cloud-gaming-best-for-demos-spectating I don't think he's changed his mind that much since then, if at all. But I think Valve is still well prepared for the future, since they already offer Cloud Gaming with Steam Link Anywhere with the only major difference being the fact that you need to provide your own Cloud and cover your own costs. Valve has always been a proponent of choice. Want to play at your desk? Just use Steam as it is. Want to play from your couch? Use Big Picture. Want to use a controller? Pick whichever you want. Don't want to use Windows? Just use Linux or Mac. So what could they do? I think they will at some point offer the option to rent a Cloud computer for a daily or monthly fee. Licensing won't be an issue as players will just use their own library of games. The networking/streaming technology already exists. They also wouldn't have to buy licenses for Windows computers, because they already support Linux/Vulkan, just like Google. But that would just be an option for anybody who wants to use it.",,kuhpunkt,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Pretty sure it takes 6 months or even a year for the titles to come out.

Google Stadia gaming at GDC 2019: Everything just announced





Google’s Stadia head Phil Harrison announces the new service.


 James Martin/CNET


When you think of ways to play big-name video games, you probably think of Microsoft’s Xbox, Sony’s PlayStation or Nintendo’s Switch. 

If Google has its way, you’ll soon be considering its Stadia service too. 

The tech giant announced its new streaming game service at a press event during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. The new service, called Stadia, is designed as a way for people to play and watch gaming together, Google said. The company said it plans to bring together players, broadcasters on YouTube and game developers to create a new experience. It’ll launch later this year, Google said, without saying anything about how much it’ll cost.

 Google rolls out Stadia gaming service and controller 

3:53


“Our ambition is far beyond a single game,” said Google’s Phil Harrison. Instead, the company sees the opportunity to give players “instant access” to a game by clicking a link. “The power of instant access is magical, and it’s already transformed the music and movie industries.”

Google teased its announcement with a video game museum.

The service allows gamers to play standard PC games within anything that can browse the web, including a TV, a phone, a tablet and of course a PC. The games are powered by Google’s high-performance computers, which then stream the images to the web browser in a similar way Netflix streams videos. And they’re streamed at up to 4k high-definition video, at 60-frames per second, meaning animations will move smoothly. 

Gamers play using a controller Google designed, which connects through WiFi to Stadia’s systems.

“It’s seamless,” Harrison said. 

Google isn’t the only company doing this. Sony’s offered its PlayStation Now game streaming service since 2014, and chipmaker Nvidia offers one called GeForce Now. Microsoft is also readying an Xbox-related game streaming service, called Project xCloud, expected in the next couple of years. 

Here’s everything we know about Google’s service so far.

It uses the “cloud”

The service relies on Google’s massive global network of computers and servers that delivers YouTube, Google Maps and Gmail to you already. Google said it’s developed specialized graphics and computer chips to make its systems work particularly well for gaming.

Google has a controller

The rumors were true: Google has developed a controller for its Stadia service. But unlike most gaming controllers, which connect to a video game console, the Stadia controller is designed to connect directly to the internet, to ensure the fastest connection.

Stadia streams at high quality

Google said its service currently streams video at 1080p, 60fps. But at launch later this year, Google said it should be capable of 4k video at 60fps, and in the future it’ll be able to output 8k video at 120fps. 

Google already has partners

The company said it’s working with Ubisoft, makers of the popular Assassin’s Creed adventure games, and id Software, makers of Doom, to bring games to the service.

Google is going to make its own games

The company also said it has started a game-making studio, much like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo have done. The company didn’t show off any games it has planned, but it’s recruited industry veterans such as former Electronic Arts and Ubisoft executive Jade Raymond.

We don’t know how much it’ll cost

Of all the things Google did announce, it didn’t put a price tag on any of it. It’s fair to assume the games will likely cost the same they typically do on a standard Xbox, PlayStation or Nintendo, but the company’s staying quiet for now.

Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, said in an interview after the event that he expects several different approaches, from direct purchase to game rentals where people sign up to play for a certain number of hours.

Stadia is designed with YouTube in mind

Google showed off how Stadia can stream video to spectators, and also offer them ways to join in. One example Google described was a “play” button on a YouTube video that brings you straight into the game on Stadia. Another example was allowing gamers watching someone play a basketball game, for example, can click a link to join in.

Google also said Stadia will have a “State Share” feature, where people can share a link that allows someone to play starting exactly at the same spot in the game that they are.

Google wants developers to use Stadia too

Google said it’s partnered with game development software makers like Epic Games, Unity and Cryengine to ensure game developers can take advantage of its technology.

Stadia is planned for launch this year and allows you to stream games across a variety of devices with very little friction. It could be a very big deal for gaming going forward. The platform aims to bring together playing, spectating, and developing games onto a single platform. As an example, you could view Assassin's Creed Odyssey on YouTube and then begin playing it through streaming in ""as little as five seconds."" Things like game updates and patches and system requirements are effectively a non-issue, because the game is running on Google's servers, rather than your local device. Google VP Phil Harrison promised the technology will work across desktops, laptops, TV, tablets, and phones. In a demonstration, the same demo was seen working across a Chromebook, smartphone, tablet, and TV, the latter through a Chromecast Ultra HDMI streamer. At launch it will stream in 4K at 60 FPS with surround sound and HDR support, and in the future Google is planning to support 8K resolution and frame-rates upwards of 120 FPS. Harrison also promised that the platform will embrace cross-platform play. You'll be able to use existing controllers on laptops and PCs, and Google will offer its own Stadia controller. The Google Stadia controller links to whichever device you're playing on, and it sports a dedicated Google Assistant button for referencing walkthrough videos if you get stuck. Gamespot . Another Gamespot article says that it doesn't work very well, even on a 20Mbps connection. ====================::==================== Quote: : Avatar They think that these streaming ""services"" will be the next big thing, but honestly if they are going to go that route, why not just let you pay for the service and download the full game to your hard drive? Then it will play perfectly and they can still get the monthly fee out of you. I know.... it's called Xbox Game Pass. WHAT A CONCEPT! Give credit where credit is due Evil... only Microsoft figured this out. Playstation Now is going the streaming route and still sucks.

I'm more the mech than you call when the servers and load balancing servers are immolating themselves because the devs are in crush since day one and stack an army of timers and loops \^\^ Gentle joke but not so far from the reality. The ""cloud gaming"" context (let's use the next gen marketing) is very demanding for devs of cheats (i compare with the actual state, off course). The lazy idiots using cheats are generally using it like a wheelchair to don't have to walk, i don't doubt by defaut than you're very good in your speciality but it imply something close to a military aiming assistance. It's no longer a framework than you add on an existing decompil code but a true standalone engine than should work in a very adverse environment (because it's very more easy and cheap to secure than a client hosting all datas and in direct link with the servers instructions). You can have unilateral authorities like with Unity, it don't change the fact than all datas are directly available on the network and on the clients. And this easy availability and context don't even help the big majority of cheat's devs to avoid insane pings peaks with their rented fecal production, specifically with aiming bots btw. This factor is not so born from an hypothetical hope, but by experience as a ""watchdog"" for a F2P (the one i'm coming from exactly). I repeat, all you can intercept between the terminal and the servers is just a video stream and inputs datas. And at the condition to broke the encapsulation, and all ""bombs"" and lures hided inside. The situation is totally inverted. And we don't even speak about virtualized context with add another layer of difficulty with things as old than ""honey pots strategies"" ... And that, to update each week if the editor is not too stupid, with the possibility to do it each hour with a minimal efforts and costs. Which is not the case actually, they continue to think in general than an heuristic engine on client side is like an archangel than will fix everything. Since twos decades at least, we all known than it don't work. The good old days of Punkbuster are gone for good \^\^ We reach there a darwinian dimension where a certain kind of professionalism is needed. Actually the majority of the cheats are coded with the feets to make little money (compared with the money you can do with this kind of skills in a decent way) and i don't speak about the usual injection of mining agent inside or onions, if not worst \^\^ Sure, you can even put your cheat engine in an ARM chip but it stay tributary to conditions than are at a light year from the actual situation, where all the critical datas are hosted by the clients and easy to capture/decompile by a teenager whatever is the strategy adopted. For Stadia i don't really follow the project, i was more interrested on Gakaï 7 years ago. Before it become ""Playstation Now""'. The curve of this project is passionnating. And i still regret today to don't have joined the company when it was possible \^\^ You're right, i've totally missed your point in translation about the hardware aspect. Make more sense for sure with your additionnal share, thanks. I share your point under this new light, but maybe in a more radical way. I allready consider than it's the end of ""personnal gaming"" and than we are living the last years of this situation. I don't say that without any tears, i love to set LAN parties with friends, juggling with microcode and firmwares, browsing BIOS ... basically having the hands in the engine. Not a suprise for a sysadmin you will say. But mixing an ""open bar"" client with terminal is just not possible to last imho. And partially for the reasons you're feeling also. I think than only the chaos and bankrupts can born from that strategy. The companies than will try to make this transition possible are not understanding the change of the paradigm imho I see that a bit like the apple store in its time in a way, so the transition between the physical support and the de-materialized one. One of the twos have to naturally die in its corner, simply. It don't change the fact than a fews DJ continue to have fun with vinyls, but on a massive scale the winner of the jackpot is the one with the better weissman score. I'm just curious to known how will mutate the hardware industry than is living from the gaming scene, i've tons of scenarios in mind but none appear rationnal lol But on human side i'm sure than the spirit will be similar to the fast food, with people eating more than necessary a food build to have an insane turn over then the progressive disparition of people knowning how to cook for themselves or to even known the lifecycle of what they eat lol Damn it appear dark writed like that, but i think than it's an advantage for niche editors like BSG in fact; than will take the role of luxury restaurants in this new world of boring and ""streamlined/easy access"" trash food for the mass.",,nopanolator,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Reddit,,,,,,,,

For years, the company has toyed with the idea of getting involved in what is now the biggest sector of the entertainment industry, worth an estimated $138 billion dollars as of last fall . And it would make competitive sense: Amazon owns Twitch, Facebook acquired Oculus, and Microsoft has Xbox. The only other major tech company without a serious gaming platform or investment of its own, not counting mobile app stores, is Apple, although even the iPhone maker is now rumored to be working on a game subscription service of its own . Google has always had many of the pieces required to challenge the likes of Sony and Nintendo. The Android operating system is the most-used mobile software on smartphones around the world, while the Chrome browser and Chromecast streaming platform have given the company an easy way to run applications in real time and access television sets. It’s not hard to imagine an Android or browser-based gaming service that can let you play advanced software on a living room TV. But, until now, all we’ve seen are a few strong hints to what Google might be building. That changes on Tuesday of next week, when Google plans to hold its first-ever keynote at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco . There’s been a lot of news over the past few months that gives us a good idea at what’s to come, but whatever Google does announce, it could have a big impact on an industry that is transforming how it builds, distributes, and sells games. Here’s a rundown what we know so far and what we think might be coming next week. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge IT’S HIGHLY LIKELY IT INVOLVES CLOUD GAMING In teasing its GDC keynote, Google said it would unveil its “vision for the future of gaming.” And, going off numerous previous reports and public showings from the company itself, it’s highly likely the announcement involves a full-fledged cloud gaming service. More than a year ago , The Information first reported about Google’s Project Yeti, the codename for an internal division responsible for building a next-generation streaming service similar to existing but limited options like Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now. Even before Sony and Nvidia’s services existed, cloud gaming had been a bit like the industry’s holy grail: a just-out-of-reach ideal that has preoccupied a number of startups like OnLive, Gaikai, and others, but that’s never been cracked because the infrastructure and economics haven’t been properly worked out. CLOUD GAMING HAS BEEN THE INDUSTRY’S HOLY GRAIL FOR YEARS The concept is relatively simple. What if, like Netflix and Spotify, you could not only digitally distribute games, but also stream them over the internet, so players wouldn’t need expensive hardware to play graphically-intensive titles? It’s difficult because games, unlike other forms of media, are both incredibly large in size and require real-time input from players. But it is doable, by wiring up the necessary hardware in a data center, running the game on a remote machine, and sending the video and receiving player commands over the internet. Regardless, it’s been impressive how many additional companies have revealed cloud gaming services in the past few years, turning what was once a niche experimental effort in an industry-wide race to figure out the future. Microsoft has gone public with its own game streaming platform , xCloud, that it plans to start testing later this year. EA, after acquiring the rental and cloud gaming service GameFly, is now working on a product of its own called Project Atlas . Even Verizon is getting into the game, with a test service up and running on Nvidia Shield set-top boxes . Earlier this week, Valve expanded its Steam Link service to turn it into a personal cloud gaming app. Both Amazon and Nintendo are looking into the technology, too.",,revlisoft,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Everything we think we know about Google’s mystery gaming announcement,,,

Since the actual resources are all being processed by some server. It just streams all that data back to you like you're playing it from your own device. But of course games need to be on the service. It's nothing new. PlayStation Now does just that and there was this thing called OnLive a few years back but that kinda flopped. There are a few much smaller endeavours along the same lines but since they're small so they're not available worldwide like the google service will be. Plus you will be able to do things like stream directly to YouTube using it and having people watching your stream be able to join your game directly. Also using the same service. So yes it is an interesting question. With Stadia games actually have to be on the service.

If you don't care about Sony and Nintendo exclusives then there is no reason to buy a console if money isn't an issue. The Xbox One X makes a great multimedia device(movies and games) if you have a home theater setup at home especially with features like a 4K HDR blu ray player, Dolby Atmos, DTS-X, Dolby Vision HDR, Free Sync, Auto Low Latency Mode and Voice control via Alexa. It can access 600+ back compatible games from previous gens, many of which have been enhanced to 4K resolution, and are console exclusives that you cannot access on PC. All these features are not available on Sony or Nintendo. You can also use your Xbox One X like a steam link by accessing your PC games in another room in the house via wifi in resolutions up to 4K on your console. Now that it supports mouse and keyboard support it basically becomes a mid range gaming PC + steam link + 4K HDR blu ray device + home theater enhancer. Many reasons to get it aside from gaming and therefore makes a very good supplement to a gaming PC which is still the best platform for gaming.

183567579707,3/19/2019,http://yahoofinance-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183567579707,"Google has announced its new game streaming platform called Stadia. (image: Google)
Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is getting into gaming with a new cloud-based streaming service. The tech giant on Tuesday announced the offering called Stadia at the Game Developers Conference 2019 in San Francisco. Stadia will allow you to stream games online to any compatible internet connected device.

Game streaming cuts out the need for gamers to purchase expensive consoles and pricy gaming computers. Google says Stadia will be playable on desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones and smart TVs. The company also said you’ll be able to play on one device, and then instantly begin playing on another without issue.

It also puts Google smack in the center of an industry that continues to see exceptional growth. The U.S. gaming industry saw $43.4 billion in revenue in 2018, up 18% from 2017. The global gaming industry is valued at $134.9 billion.

Google says you’ll be able to view a game trailer on YouTube, where there will be a “play now” button. Click that, and you will launch the game in less than 5 seconds and be able to start playing it without any download needed.

Google believes that it is the only company that is equipped to be able to handle streaming games to people around the world thanks to its existing cloud infrastructure, which houses data centers and endpoints in a slew of regions and countries.

The competition

Google’s streaming service isn’t the only game in town, though. 

Nvidia’s (NVDA) GeForce Now, available through a free beta, lets you stream games to your Windows PC, Mac, or the Nvidia Shield, the company’s Android TV-powered streaming device. Microsoft (MSFT) is also working on a streaming service called Project xCloud, which is expected to let you stream your favorite Xbox games to other devices. Trials for the service will begin later this year.

Valve’s Steam Link Anywhere was recently updated to allow you to stream games from your home PC to your Android device, while Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation Now lets you stream games to your PlayStation 4. Amazon (AMZN) is also reportedly getting in on the streaming business with plans to offer its own service.

Then there are the smaller companies like Blade’s Shadow, a streaming service that lets you remotely access and use a high-end PC to do everything from gaming to video editing.

Google’s planned streaming service has been in development for more than two years and was first made available to consumers in October 2018 as a beta. During the beta’s run, players could stream Ubisoft’s “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” through a Chrome web browser tab. But as Google CEO Sundar Pichai admitted during the company’s keynote, that technical test was just to ensure Google could handle streaming games.

The new service will be playable via Google’s own custom controller, the Stadia Controller, which, of course, has a Google Assistant button built in. The controller actually connects via Wi-Fi to the internet so that it hooks up directly to the server you’re streaming the game from to cut down on any potential lag.

If you’re a laptop or PC player, you’ll also be able to use your existing keyboard and mouse.

Whether or not gamers are ready for cloud gaming remains to be seen. None of the services that are currently available have taken off quite like standard video streaming services such as Netflix.

Then there’s the issue of how much bandwidth game streaming services will require. Today’s gamers are playing titles at 1080p and 4K resolutions with refresh rates ranging from 30 frames per second to 60 frames per second. Those refresh rates are even higher on high-end gaming PCs.

Google says that it in the future it will allow gamers to stream titles at 4K resolutions at 60 fps with HDR and surround sound.

To stream a 4K movie on a service like Netflix, though, the company recommends a connection speed of at least 25 megabits per second. You’ll likely need a similar connection to stream 4K games. And while internet speeds have improved in the U.S. in the past few years, many Americans still can’t reach those levels.

183599180751,3/20/2019,http://slimgigs.tumblr.com/post/183599180751,"There’s a good chance we’ll remember Google’s Stadia announcement as a landmark moment in gaming. In one fell swoop, Google laid out its plans for an ambitious game-streaming service that goes far beyond anything we’ve ever seen before. Stadia promises unparalleled graphical power, near-instant access and the ability to play the latest titles on almost any screen. As Google’s announcement went on, the future came into focus — a world where the frustration of modern consoles didn’t exist and games flowed as freely as water.

Obviously, plenty of questions still remain. We don’t know what Stadia will cost or how well it’ll perform with millions of players slamming Google’s servers (the Project Stream beta was solid, at least). But after plenty of false starts in game streaming, Stadia feels like the bold swing that could make it truly take off. That might seem surprising, coming from a company that hasn’t had much experience with games. But historically many of the biggest shifts in the industry came from newcomers: Sony proved CDs were a viable upgrade to cartridges with the PlayStation, and Microsoft showed the importance of a robust online service with Xbox Live. Each of those companies tapped into their expertise to shift the gaming landscape, so it makes sense that Google would be the one to nail streaming. It requires a deep understanding of the internet and experience in delivering complex services to a wide variety of devices.

For years, streaming games over the internet has seemed like a pipe dream. OnLive made a huge splash a decade ago only to burn out a few years later (Sony picked up its patent scraps). Gaikai was a direct competitor, which Sony snapped up and used its technology to build PlayStation Now and Remote Play. More recently, we’ve seen the likes of NVIDIA take a stab with GeForce Now — a solid service but one that’s perpetually been in beta. There are also smaller companies like Blade and Parsec that are trying to make their mark. Microsoft, meanwhile, says it’s working on its own game-streaming solution, Project xCloud, which we’re expecting more details about at E3.

While all of these services basically do the same thing (let you play titles running on remote servers over the internet), Stadia’s scope is on an entirely different level. Google says it’ll be powered by servers running custom CPUs and AMD GPUs capable of 10.7 teraflops, on par with NVIDIA’s GTX 1080 Ti. In comparison, the Xbox One X, the most powerful console today, has six teraflops. The company claims Stadia will support up to 4K HDR at 60 frames per second, something that only gaming PCs can achieve today. It’s also eyeing 8K 120+ FPS down the line, specs that no game supports today. To deal with more-demanding games, Stadia will be able to use multiple servers and GPUs seamlessly. And it will also rely on server-class SSDs, which means your games and levels will load faster than any console. Basically, you won’t have to worry about specs anymore.

Of course, raw power doesn’t mean much if your gameplay is laggy because the servers are far away, but Google says it’ll have 7,500 server locations around the world. We haven’t seen server stats from earlier streaming services, but even OnLive at the height of its popularity couldn’t deploy data centers as easily as Google. That’s also a sign that smaller companies like Blade and Parsec will have a hard time competing.

Google is also making its service a much more web-connected experience than consoles. Press a button on the new Stadia controller and you’ll quickly start streaming your experience on YouTube gaming. Another button lets you access Google Assistant, which can automatically point you to YouTube videos to help you get through a tough level. Google says Stadia will also lead to lag-free multiplayer matches, since all the networking complexity happens on its cloud. And there’s another surprising advantage: The service could also help us relive the days when we spent hours playing Goldeneye on crowded couches. Many modern titles are too demanding to support cooperative multiplayer on a single TV, but that’s not a problem for Stadia’s cloud processing.

The Stadia controller is unique in another respect: It connects to the internet over WiFi, giving it direct communication with the server. That’s a smart way to reduce input lag, a common problem with every game-streaming service so far. Previously, you’d press a button on a controller and it would go through a local device and make its way to a server; then you’d see the result when it appeared on your screen.

Stadia appears to address most of the problems inherent with game streaming while also offering significant advantages over today’s consoles. With its large server footprint and powerful hardware, Google says you’ll be able to start a game in less than five seconds. You won’t have to worry about downloading, installing and updating anything. (I can’t count the number of times when I’ve had 30 minutes to play something only to be thwarted by a huge update.) Its expandable graphics mean it could scale to whatever quality you need. And of course, there’s no giant box to deal with — all you need is an internet connection and a device that runs Chrome. As Google demonstrated at GDC, you’ll be able to easily continue a single play session across multiple devices.

Perhaps most important, Google seems to be throwing everything it has behind Stadia, something we haven’t seen with a game-streaming service since PlayOn. It’s even hired industry veteran Jade Raymond to head up its first-party studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment. Hopefully, Stadia will encourage competitors like NVIDIA and Microsoft to step up with their own offerings. While there’s still plenty left up in the air, Stadia is the boldest play we’ve seen yet for the next generation of gaming.

Today was the big coming out party for Stadia, Google’s upcoming game streaming platform that promises to let you play games over the internet on practically any device, and hopefully lag-free.

However, despite shedding light on how it works and what kind of server infrastructure Google is using, there were a couple of key details about Stadia Google didn’t reveal including its price structure and when it will be officially available.

Advertisement

All we know for the latter is that Stadia will go live sometime this year, but the more important question is the one about price. So I ask, how much do you think Stadia will cost, or more specifically, how much would you pay for Google’s game streaming platform?

Now a lot of this will come down to how well Stadia actually functions, especially for people with less reliable internet connections. But for the sake of our hypothetical question, let’s assume Stadia works as advertised.

Now that we have the ground rules set, there are essentially two ways Google can go with Stadia’s pricing. One would be to position Stadia as a sort of Netflix for games, where a monthly subscription would give you access to a roster of games that you could play on your tablet, laptop, etc. Users wouldn’t be responsible for buying actual games, and instead, it would fall upon Google to license new titles and add them to Stadia’s roster.

Sony’s Playstation Now, costs $20 a month and lets you stream over 750 PS2, PS3, and PS4 games to your PS4 or PC. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s GeForce Now service lets you stream games to a Windows or Mac PC, or one of Nvidia’s Shield devices. However, because GeForce Now is still in beta, Nvidia isn’t charging anything for it yet.

Then there are smaller game streaming services like Jump, which normally costs $10 a month, but at the time of writing, has been discounted to just $5. Alternatively, with a monthly price of $30, Shadow’s streaming service is on the higher side of things, though it combats that price by offering high-res gameplay at 1080p at 144Hz, or 4K at 60Hz.

And while Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass isn’t technically a game streaming service, it’s yet another service Google Stadia will have to compete with, which makes it $10 a month pricing relevant.

If Google does opt for a subscription model (which I think is the most likely outcome), Stadia will probably end up costing between $15 and $20 a month, which is slightly more than a Netflix sub, but still low enough that even after a year, you will have saved money compared to buying a traditional console and a game or two.

The other option would be for Google to make Stadia free, or available for some very low nominal price, and instead ask users to buy games digitally on a Steam-like Stadia store, which people could then use to stream games to their devices. From Google’s perspective, this might be the easier solution, because the company wouldn’t have to license a stable of games from developers and publishers. But from a user standpoint, it wouldn’t offer quite as much value if you had to buy each game you wanted to stream individually, rather than having access to a large lineup of games from the start. 

And of course, there’s a hybrid of the two schemes, which would require a monthly sub plus forcing users to buy games. But that’s messy, complicated, and too expensive, which is why no other game streaming services do this, and why Google almost certainly won’t either. 

So which model would you prefer, and how much would you be willing to pay for Google Stadia’s game streaming service?

Click to expand... Well, here comes the future. This is just Google's version of this technology: Shadow Tech = PC Gaming on anything, GAME CHANGER Great for single player gaming. Casual phone gamers is definitely the prime market. I've been predicting since 2015 that Google and Apple would splash into the console gaming market with their HTPC products (ex. Apple TV). They've been ready for a while. They just needed first party support thrown behind a dual-analog controller. Was waiting on Google to release their own version of the NVIDIA Shield. Looks like they're bypassing that strategy to make it so people don't have to buy any separate device at all, and can run it on their phones, or low-end Android devices. Yeah, smart. Didn't see that leapfrog. Won't be adequate for competitive multiplayer due to light speed limitations (too much microlag). Don't fall for cloud computing power boasts. Who cares? You're limited by your stream bandwidth. I'm going to operate on the assumption that 484 GB /s is a typo, and that is meant to say Gb /s. Either way it doesn't matter because they're just pimping connections that don't exist outside of places like Google labs, universities, or the most highly-funded science orgs. In 2018 the average USA internet speed was 96 Mb/s . Keep in mind that doesn't tell you your lows, and that's if you have your connection to yourself. If you have the connection all to yourself, too. If shared in a home with a lot of family members on multiple devices there will be leeching. I mean, it's just laughable figure. It's only about 200x as fast as the current fastest NVMe drives in existence can transfer data. I'm not wasting time checking figures and crunching numbers, but I doubt even the Intel Xeon W-3175X CPU can compute data that quickly. It can't just be on their end. To speak figuratively, that's not how telephones work. Madmick said: ↑ But...apart from intolerable latency to competitive multiplayer the biggest drawback is still nerfed graphics. Those internet users fortunate enough to have the best internet connections see a ceiling compression package delivery via Shadow of 50 Mbps-70 Mbps (Mega bits ), he says. This takes your PC-caliber graphics to Twitch-caliber streaming. After all, for [email protected] , your PC requires a transfer of 2389 Mbps to express every single pixel. Not even Gigabit internet is sufficient. Furthermore, despite that this streamed data is a coded compression, designed to be decoded and unpacked in real-time via hardware acceleration by the ""Shadow Ghost"" box on your end, there isn't a chance in hell that you're closing that gap, and besides, decoding itself operates on an imprecise dynamic strategy in order to look as close to the uncompressed source as possible (like mp4 and ac3 rips online for video/music). This is also merely 1080p at 144fps. Click to expand... Of course, the above means that [email protected] , today's most demanding standard, requires 9555 Mb/s in order to push through 100% of the pixels with perfect fidelity. In other words, big picture gents, we're about to enter an internet-limited age for video games. This just makes too much sense for the major corporations as businesses. They can control all their software, ravaging piracy, deliver a viable product for cheaper, and increase their market by an enormous amount. It will be similar to Netflix/YouTube streaming in its youth, and still to this day. Get ready for graphics to regress, and quite steeply, using these services, for a temporary period. Blu-Ray is still far superior to these in terms of raw image, but the compression algorithms (i.e. mp4 video, mp3/aac/opus audio) and people's internet speeds have caught up to the point that in 2019 few care unless they have a gigantic 4K OLED TV that they really want to make pop for guests. But it was pretty rough there in the late 2000's. Just look at the old fight vids that pop up in the Street Coliseum. There will be a hazing period for this technology, I think, but it won't be so bad, because on the user end, we've already reached these minimums that the human eye finds more tolerable.",,Madmick,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Google Stadia | Page 3,,,

Tech giant Google announced their game streaming platform Stadia at the 2019 Game Developers Conference. The device-agnostic game streaming technology is similar in concept to companies like Netflix and Spotify’s video/music streaming. Stadia/Project Stream is not the first to attempt this; Similar services have existed in the past such as OnLive and Sony’s Playstation Now however the companies infrastructure may be the key to success for cloud based gaming. How Stadia will work is simple players will be able to remotely run games via a data centre and get direct video feedback on Chrome browsers with any device such as an Android phone or Tablet. Stadia will use a combination of Googles network and video streaming technologies allowing users to gain instant access to games and ability to live stream by simply clicking on a link no download or specific hardware necessary. The Stadia Controller will give you full access to the platform; using wi-fi this controller will connect to Stadia via a server and then instantly link to whatever screen or device you are playing on. The Stadia controller is comparable to most modern gaming controllers but does have two unique Google features; The Stadia controller has an instant share feature that utilizes Youtube as well as Google assistant. Early reports indicate that this will be a subscription based service however no official pricing has been announced.

183705394510,3/25/2019,http://eduardobutton.tumblr.com/post/183705394510,"PlayStation Now launched in 2014 in North America. It features games that is streamed over an internet connection, similar to Google’s recently announced Stadia service. Only it is, you know, actually out. While PlayStation Now is usually offered in one and three month subscription options, every now and then a deal on a full year of service comes along at a price that is too good for some to pass up. This is one of those times.

When available, the year subscription tier for PlayStation Now is usually $99.99, but it is currently on sale on Amazon for $59.99. This represents a discount of 40%. That works out to approximately $5 a month. This is also the only subscription tier on sale, as the normal one month price remains at $19.99 and the three-month package is still $44.99.

It’s worth noting that, while Sony says that streaming games requires a minimum of a 5 mpbs internet connection, that is for ideal network conditions. If your console or compatible device (currently only the PS4 and PCs) is the only thing on the network, then you might be able to stream games successfully at lower conditions. But whose house isn’t filled with all kinds of internet-connected devices, such as phones, tablets, and smart TVs? So, make sure you have a decent internet connection before splurging on this year subscription.

Is this discounted price point low enough to tempt you? There is no word on how long this discount lasts, so get it while you can! Considering there are over 650 games available to stream and more than 200 games available to download through PlayStation Now, there is certainly value in such a subscription, assuming you have a robust enough internet connection. With everything from arcade sports titles and RPGs to modern PS4 games, there’s bound to be something to find in such a large catalog of games for all kinds of players.

How Google Stadia could be a success



Stadia is Google’s new gaming service that promises latency free 4K quality streaming of AAA games to any device that can run the Chrome browser. The new product offers some interesting gimmicks, such as easy sharing to YouTube and integrated Google Assistant. Can Google make space for itself in the lucrative but entrenched gaming market? It has a chance, if it makes the right moves.

The price must be right

Google has been tight-lipped about Stadia’s business model but, after the initial cost of buying the controller, is likely to go one of two ways: 

A subscription model in which users don’t buy games but instead pay monthly accesses a full library of titles, i.e. that Netflix of games everyone’s talking about these days.
 Google’s own game store a la Steam, Epic Store, Origin, etc, through which users can buy individual games. 

Of the two, a subscription model will likely be more attractive to users, even it means Google will have to invest more into licensing a tempting enough roster. The ability to just pick up and play a game you like, or one that was just shared on YouTube in a ‘save state’, without being interrupted by having to make a purchase is what makes sense for Google’s convenience is king pitch.

The pricing of a subscription model will probably be somewhere between $15-$20 a month, to stay competitive with PlayStation Now ($20/month), Xbox Game Pass ($10/month), Shadow’s high-end streaming service ($30/month) and indeed, Netflix itself, which has identified video games as one of their main rivals for consumers’ attention.

A $15 or $20 monthly fee saves a bunch compared to buying a home console or gaming PC along with several $60 games a year. Of course, it needs to have the games you want to play.

Convenience also needs content

Google became the giant it is today through offering effective, well-integrated, convenient services like Chrome, Gmail, maps and so on for free. I’ve no doubt that the company can make a service that’s user-friendly and smooths out many of the hardware hurdles between game purchasing, loading, sharing, and streaming. Getting and playing a game in one tap after seeing its trailer on YouTube? Sounds great, but that won’t mean anything unless it has the right games on it.

So far we’ve only got Doom Eternal confirmed for Google Stadia, a title that’s also going to be on every other major platform. And while I’m always happy to see somewhere else you can play Doom, it’s not the killer app it used to be, so Google will need more than this to carry its platform. Will we get more titles like Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, which Google used to test Project Stream?

Stadia-exclusive titles will be produced by Stadia Games and Entertainment, a new in-house studio headed by industry veteran Jade Raymond (Electronic Arts, Ubisoft). Google says more than 100 studios already have dev kits for Stadia, and more than 1,000 creatives and engineers are already working on Stadia-compatible titles.

A killer exclusive title that everyone will talk about (and presumably, share all over YouTube) would have been the best way for Stadia to kick off. And sadly, it didn’t. But Google does have both the clout and the cash to come up with something good, and it looks like it has the talent on board too. Will Stadia get a God of War or Mario Kart style megahit to be its flagship franchise? If it can come out swinging with one at launch, that could make all the difference.

Connection speed will be key

Is streaming the future of gaming? Emphasis on future, because right now, 5G fantasies aside, many people in the present day do not have a good or stable enough Internet connection for this to be feasible. Google has outlined that Stadia will require “approximately” 25Mbps download speeds to deliver 4K streaming at 60fps. 

If your Internet isn’t up to scratch, and there’s a good chance it won’t be, depending on where you live, then the resulting latency may be unbearable in fast-paced competitive titles, though slower games such as turn-based strategy titles won’t suffer much. This is going to be a deal-breaker for many though…either your connection is good and Stadia could be a viable option, or it just won’t be. There’s also the issue of how operators will treat game streaming platforms now that net neutrality regulations aren’t an issue. No one will want to pay extra to their operator just to use Stadia.

There’s a market for this but…

I’ll admit right away, I’m not in it. As a PC gamer who’s invested heavily in hardware and enjoys modding and also playing older games, the idea of a Netflix style service where games could be yanked out of my library at Google’s whims, or can’t benefit from mods or be played offline doesn’t appeal. But I do know people who this could be just right for, in theory.

Opinion by Nicholas Montegriffo

The key market here is people who would like to game more but don’t have the hardware

Plenty of people get excited for new games, love watching trailers and streams of these games on YouTube, but they don’t have the hardware to run them. Perhaps they bought the wrong console or just didn’t upgrade to the latest gen, or just have other priorities to their spending. But, at a low investment, they can buy Stadia and impulse-play these games straight from the video that they’re viewing on their smartphone, TV, laptop, etc. Almost everyone has at least one device that can use Chrome, and thus Stadia. But, there’s another thing to consider.

Google needs to win trust

Let’s face it, consumers have good reason to be afraid to bet on a new Google product. The company has a history of abandoned projects. We’re about to say goodbye to Inbox on April 2, and it can’t help bring to mind the fear that Stadia will be hyped up initially only to be dropped in a couple of years. Is Stadia the next Google Glass? 


 Remember when this was “the future?” / © AndroidPIT

Google has enough money to afford to fail big and keep going, but for consumers to take a chance on Stadia, it had better be very, very cheap and very convenient. Because it’s Google that has everything to prove in this case, and we’ll be paying with our data anyway.

5625776c-6136-40aa-909b-94f25a7549cd,3/18/2019,http://gamrconnect.vgchartz.com/thread.php?id=239634#10,"OK, after watching the presentation, I thought it was interesting, but I need to see more to decide how this will work out. Thinking about for the last hour I am now pretty much convinced, that Google Stadia will succeed. First of all: what means success? Well, in this case I would say it has 50 million monthly active users in five years (2024) each month of the year. And it will grow more, because it isn't disrupted by generations and has to start all over. So, why do I think this? First of all, this was a presentation clearly intended for game developers (no surprise at the Game Developers Conference). And from the perspective of a game developer there was a lot to love. This was not a presentation for gamers - I expect this will happen later. So from a gamers view some things still seem unclear. What was there for a game developer to love? Well, the presentation clearly was intended to show that everyone can pick up gaming pretty simple. Google is lying a bit if they say you don't need something special - you need Chrome. But as pretty much everyone already has it, this hurdle is not very big. So they are showing the game developers a potentially big userbase with no need to sell them something first before they can joining Stadia. Hundreds of millions of people already have a working installation to joining Stadia and play. Secondly they showed that bringing people into playing a game is extremely easy. As easy as an youtube streamer has a simple link and people liking the video can play the same game instantly. This is extremely helpful for smaller developers to bring people to play their game. Google even showed that the youtubers probably can connect closer to the community offering this, so the game developers can be content this feature will be used. Google also convinced them that they have a defined platform so that the developers don't have to add options for different hardware configurations, while this platform is also powerful enough to be not restricting at the moment. I am sure Google will update this standard platform once a year or so, but developers can develop for a defined platform similar to a console, while having few power constraints like on PC. Google also showed that they have the most common middleware like Unreal engine and Unity already lined up for their platform. They also showed how the platform can support game development (the demo showing how different artstyles are applied to a polygon model) and multiplayer. This means more exciting options in games with less development time. This all says to me, that right there at GDC Google will be able to win over a lot of smaller developers for the platform, so that they can show a more impressive lineup then they launch. But Google wasn't sleeping either. In the short video they showed Trials, Just Dance and Assassins Creed, so obviously Ubisoft is on board. The showing of Doom Eternal was registering Bethesda support, but that presentation was actually more to assure the input lag wouldn't be too bad. They also said they have first party development, without going into detail. This more or less shows me, that Google is aware they need games to push the platform and were active in that direction. But why do I think they will succeed? Now, people here are focused on image quality, compression, data plans and input lag. But in reality losses in image quality, compression and data plans isn't holding back Netflix. To the point Disney and Warner decided to start a competition. So while many users in this forum care about this stuff, many people outside this forum will not care or even notice. Input lag could ruin your experience. That's why Google showed Doom Eternal. This is less about the game per se, but more about: look, this game that is really fast-paced works on Stadia and id software is convinced enough of it to go with the platform. So I think Google has reduced the problem enough to make it viable for a majority. Still, avid gamers will complain about the lag. But I am very convinced Stadia will bring a lot of people into gaming, which are currently on the fence or play sporadically. And the potential in this group is huge. Google might have a blue ocean here (not for long, I will come to this). So basically what I take from this presentation is the following: Google knows what they are doing, they touched enough of the points so that I know they thought of it. Stadia could bring many people into gaming which are currently reluctant. The potential is huge, as pretty much everyone has a device with Chrome. They have lined up support from middleware and gaming companies and this presentation was made to bring in more game developers for securing a great lineup. The convinience of this system is better than current console platforms. Why hasn't gaming catched on so far and what does Google differently? Well, the convenience is the main point here. The presentation drove home the point that everyone on pretty much every device can play with Stadia. They need no special client, no special hardware, simply a browser. So far I don't see it that much. I do think though that this offer will not stay unmatched. I can think Microsoft is already thinking in this direction. Also Amazon has the capabilities to offer their own service. But Google has for now started and has the first mover advantage. I see many people in this forum will say Stadia will fail, with the same reasons they explain why Netflix never can work and Bluray is better. The reasons are completely true, but will not matter for the majority of people. And I am pretty much convinced Google has secured the points that matter. 3DS-FC: 4511-1768-7903 (Mii-Name: Mnementh), Nintendo-Network-ID: Mnementh, Switch: SW-7706-3819-9381 (Mnementh) my greatest games: 2017 , 2018 Predictions: Switch / Switch / Switch / MHWorld / GOW > BOTW / Switch vs. XB1 in the US View Post Around the Network The_Liquid_Laser Currently Offline View Profile View Posts Games Collection 5,813 1776 posts since 10/11/17 Recent Badges: Leaving Limbo 100 posts on the gamrConnect forums.

They aren't going to be alone in this game. Either way, I see Stadia being more like Amazon Video than Netflix. A large company, but ultimately with less content and userbase than a smaller, older player in the game which came later to the same innovative, onlie market.

Currently Playing: Far Cry 2 (PC) shikamaru317 10 hours ago I see several roadblocks they will need to overcome: -Lack of high speed internet access in rural areas. Looking like this will take at least 5-10 years to overcome this roadblock, as ISP's are being slow to roll out white space internet and super wi-fi to provide high speed to rural areas -Many ISP's, including the largest in the US, Comcast, have data caps. Comcast has a 1 TB a month cap, and it is being reported that Stadia will use 20 GB per hour, which means you would eat through your entire 1 TB allotment in just 50 hours of gaming. The only thing that is likely to overcome this roadblock is government oversight, the government stepping in to force the ISP's to get rid of data caps, because they have no intention of getting rid of them on their own. -Many ISP's are known to throttle connection speeds for users who do alot of streaming on Netflix and the like, they will very likely do the same for Stadia, which will effect the image quality of the stream. Once again, government oversight is the only thing likely to overcome this barrier, as the ISP's have no intention of getting rid of streaming throttles.

Here’s what to expect [br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095344.png""][br][br][br][br]Google is making a big play in gaming next week, but we’re still unsure exactly what that entails. For years, the company has toyed with the idea of getting involved in what is now the biggest sector of the entertainment industry, worth an [a href=""https://lpesports.com/e-sports-news/the-video-games-industry-is-bigger-than-hollywood""]estimated $138 billion dollars as of last fall[/a]. And it would make competitive sense: Amazon owns Twitch, Facebook acquired Oculus, and Microsoft has Xbox. The only other major tech company without a serious gaming platform or investment of its own, not counting mobile app stores, is Apple, although even the iPhone maker is now [a href=""https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/apple-reportedly-plans-netflix-for-games-subscription-service/""]rumored to be working on a game subscription service of its own[/a].[br][br]Google has always had many of the pieces required to challenge the likes of Sony and Nintendo. The Android operating system is the most-used mobile software on smartphones around the world, while the Chrome browser and Chromecast streaming platform have given the company an easy way to run applications in real time and access television sets. It’s not hard to imagine an Android or browser-based gaming service that can let you play advanced software on a living room TV.[br][br]But, until now, all we’ve seen are a few strong hints to what Google might be building. That changes on Tuesday of next week, when Google plans to hold its [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262215/google-gdc-19-keynote-event-teaser-video-project-stream""]first-ever keynote at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco[/a]. There’s been a lot of news over the past few months that gives us a good idea at what’s to come, but whatever Google does announce, it could have a big impact on an industry that is transforming how it builds, distributes, and sells games. Here’s a rundown what we know so far and what we think might be coming next week.[br][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095355.png""][br][br][br]Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge[br] It’s highly likely it involves cloud gaming [br][br]In teasing its GDC keynote, Google said it would unveil its “vision for the future of gaming.” And, going off numerous previous reports and public showings from the company itself, it’s highly likely the announcement involves a full-fledged cloud gaming service. [a href=""https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-may-step-into-gaming-with-yeti-streaming-service""]More than a year ago[/a], The Information first reported about Google’s Project Yeti, the codename for an internal division responsible for building a next-generation streaming service similar to existing but limited options like Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now.[br][br]Even before Sony and Nvidia’s services existed, cloud gaming had been a bit like the industry’s holy grail: a just-out-of-reach ideal that has preoccupied a number of startups like OnLive, Gaikai, and others, but that’s never been cracked because the infrastructure and economics haven’t been properly worked out.[br][br]CLOUD GAMING HAS BEEN THE INDUSTRY’S HOLY GRAIL FOR YEARS[br][br]The concept is relatively simple. What if, like Netflix and Spotify, you could not only digitally distribute games, but also stream them over the internet, so players wouldn’t need expensive hardware to play graphically-intensive titles? It’s difficult because games, unlike other forms of media, are both incredibly large in size and require real-time input from players. But it is doable, by wiring up the necessary hardware in a data center, running the game on a remote machine, and sending the video and receiving player commands over the internet.[br][br]Regardless, it’s been impressive how many additional companies have revealed cloud gaming services in the past few years, turning what was once a niche experimental effort in an industry-wide race to figure out the future. Microsoft has [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263405/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-demo-video""]gone public with its own game streaming platform[/a], xCloud, that it plans to start testing later this year. EA, after acquiring the rental and cloud gaming service GameFly, is [a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/eas-project-atlas-wants-your-gaming-to-run-on-cloud-computing-and-ai/""]now working on a product of its own called Project Atlas[/a]. Even Verizon is getting into the game, with a [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179048/verizon-gaming-video-game-streaming-service-vzg-nvidia-shield-android""]test service up and running on Nvidia Shield set-top boxes[/a]. Earlier this week, [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265818/valve-steam-link-anywhere-personal-cloud-service-gaming-pc-gdc-2019""]Valve expanded its Steam Link service[/a] to turn it into a personal cloud gaming app. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177253/amazon-cloud-gaming-service-rumor-job-posting""]Both Amazon and Nintendo[/a]are looking into the technology, too.[br][br]There’s been a number of obvious signs that Google is indeed working on cloud gaming. Most prominently, Google [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17924492/google-project-stream-game-assassins-creed-odyssey-free-testing""]launched its public test of Project Stream[/a], an experimental game streaming technology that worked directly in its Chrome browser. Through a partnership with Ubisoft, Google let you play the brand-new Assassin’s Creed Odyssey — without needing to purchase the game — on pretty much any machine, given you had a strong enough internet connection.[br][br]GOOGLE’S PROJECT STREAM TEST IS AN OBVIOUS SIGN OF WHAT’S TO COME[br][br]It was a remarkable experiment, not [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17950998/google-project-stream-gaming-assasins-creed-odyssey-first-impression""]just because it actually worked quite well[/a], but also because a game studio as large as Ubisoft agreed to let one of its biggest launches of the year be a test subject. The test is now over, but Google [a href=""https://blog.google/technology/developers/pushing-limits-streaming-technology/""]set out to gather data[/a] from what it considered a “technical test to solve some of the biggest challenges of streaming,” data that could help inform whatever product it announces next week.[br][br]There’s also been a lot of strategic hires in the past 18 months or so that hint toward a large, legitimate push into the gaming sector. Phil Harrison, a long-time executive of both Sony and Microsoft’s Xbox team, [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/22/16921214/phil-harrison-google-games""]joined Google last year[/a] as a general manager and vice president, but working in an disclosed capacity. At the time, it was believed Harrison was going to help Google build out its virtual and augmented reality platforms as viable gaming businesses. But Harrison was also on the board of game streaming company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/16/4442372/inside-gaikai-how-to-make-cloud-gaming-as-easy-as-watching-youtube""]Gaikai[/a], a company [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4010420/sonys-playstation-4-will-use-gaikai-game-streaming-technology""]acquired by Sony in 2012[/a] and instrumental to the launch of its PlayStation Now service. So it’s likely Harrison is helping Google in its similar efforts.[br][br]Later in the year, [a href=""https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1564647&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjackbuser%2F""]Google hired Jack Buser[/a], who was a senior director at Sony’s game streaming unit and led the PlayStation platform’s social efforts before that. Shortly after, Google [a href=""https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/30/google-hires-sonys-playstation-vr-guru-and-magic-lab-head-richard-marks/""]also hired Sony senior research engineer Richard Marks[/a], who helped build the PlayStation VR headset and Move controller.[br][br]And just last week, gaming industry veteran Jade Raymond [a href=""https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/13/18263911/jade-raymond-google-vp""]also joined Google as a vice president[/a], though we don’t what team or division she’ll be leading. The timing may not be coincidental. Raymond, who was executive producer and co-creator of Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed and later joined Electronic Arts, could be heading up some type of creative division at Google, or one responsible for developer outreach given her connections at big studios and publishers.[br][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][img src=""/storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshot/Screenshot_20190317-095409.png""][br][br][br]Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge[br][br] There’s a hardware component, and it may involve Chromecast [br][br]We don’t have too much to go on regarding what this service might look like, but we do know that there’s a strong likelihood there is custom Google hardware involved. Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware and its senior vice president of devices, tweeted out a link to the GDC keynote earlier this week:[br][br]Osterloh oversees Pixel phones, Google Home devices, and the myriad other hardware products the search giant now produces in-house. Whether that means we’re getting a Pixel-branded cloud gaming console or something else entirely is unclear. But it’s interesting nonetheless to see Osterloh involved in some way. [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]Kotaku[/a] [a href=""https://kotaku.com/sources-google-is-planning-a-game-platform-that-could-1827217387""]’s Jason Schreier[/a], who corroborated many of the initial details about Google’s upcoming service last summer, also reported that hardware will be one of three big components to the service, the other two being streaming and a massive in-house developer division that sounds very much like what Raymond could be involved in.[br][br]If we had to speculate on what exactly a Google game-streaming platform look like, we don’t have to look too hard. That’s because it could very well already exist, at least in part, as Chromecast. Google’s streaming dongle is already capable of letting you play Android games on your TV using screen mirroring from a compatible smartphone.[br][br]Now, that’s not to say that this new game streaming platform will just piggyback off Chromecast. But Chromecast does provide a model for how Google might go about delivering gaming experiences to a TV. For one, it’s a no-frills package that plugs in through one port and stays out of the way. And because cloud gaming, like media streaming, doesn’t require a ton of local processing power, the hardware can be lightweight and cheap. Given the amount of buzz Google is creating here though, it seems more likely it’ll drop all-new hardware specifically for gaming.[br][br] There could be a game controller to go with it [br][br]You can’t have console-quality gaming (if that is indeed what Google is going for) without some type of peripheral. For Google, that means building your own controller. [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257911/google-patent-game-controller-project-stream-streaming-service-render""]According to a patent revealed late last week[/a], that might be exactly what the company has done, with images showing off a Google-branded gamepad that like a cross between a PlayStation controller and the [a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]ill-fated[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] [/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""]Ouya’s[/a][a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review""] gamepad[/a] from a half-decade ago.[br][br][br][br][br][br][br]Image: Google[br][br]This, even if Google doesn’t produce an actual console, might be why Osterloh’s hardware division is involved. For one, if Microsoft and Sony are building competing services, Google might not want its customers using other companies’ controllers.[br][br]And it’s a no-brainer that a service of this type would need to be first-and-foremost a controller-centric experience. As it stands right now, any kind of cloud gaming service is probably going to have at least some issues with connectivity. The bar for console game performance is much lower than on PC, where competitive games require the best connections possible and even milliseconds of latency matter to hardcore players.[br][br]In other words, this probably isn’t going to launch as a mouse-and-keyboard experience, at least not at first. So while we might not get Fortnite , Apex Legends , or Dota 2 on Google’s platform, there’s a good chance this service could very well be a place to play big-budget, single-player games like Assassin’s Creed .[br][br] ====================::==================== Thanks brother for sharing",,sakhr68,France,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Everything we think we know about Google’s mystery gaming announcement,,,

If the rumour turns out to be true, Sony's PlayStation Now and PlayStation Plus would be joined by a third subscription service. EA Access is a paid subscription service that allows users to download and play select EA titles for a price of $4.99/£3.99/€3.99 a month, or $29.99/£19.99/€24.99 if you decide to get the yearly subscription. The list of games included in the service consists of almost every sports title by EA: NBA Live, NHL, Madden, UFC and FIFA. Other major titles from different genres are also up for grabs, with the likes of Battlefield 1, Star Wars Battlefront II, Need for Speed Payback, Titanfall 2 and many others. Back in 2014, when the service first launched on Xbox One, a Sony representative stated that PlayStation is not interested in what EA Access has to offer, describing the service as low value for its subscription price. The same source gave a statement to Game Informer, saying ""We evaluated the EA Access subscription offering and decided that it does not bring the kind of value PlayStation customers have come to expect."" Bringing its service to PC as well in 2016, called Origin Access, EA was recently Quote: d saying that they are planning on offering a subscription service on another major platform. With Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 being the only two ""major platforms"" without EA Access at the moment, a recent post on Reddit leads us to believe that it is indeed Sony who may have had a change of heart regarding the addition of EA's enticing service. Namely, a Reddit user named Sabazin uploaded a screenshot of the Brazilian PlayStation Store that shows the EA Access icon above a text that reads ""Now available"" in Portuguese. The user went on to explain in the comments section of his post that the screenshot was not taken by him, and that he only received it in a local PS4 chat group, so he could not confirm that the photo is indeed legitimate nor could he give any more details as to where pressing on the EA icon would take you. Being only a rumour thus far, we suggest taking it with a grain of salt, as per usual. RedditScreenshot of the Brazilian PSN Store with EA Access card.The screenshot does look pretty convincing. Nevertheless, taking into consideration EA's earlier statements about the expansion of their service to another major platform and the alleged screenshot, it certainly seems as though things are pointing to Sony finally reaching an agreement with EA and allowing the service to be added to their flagship console. ====================::==================== Depending on what games you play this could be a good deal. In my home FIFA and NBA Live is all that we've been playing for some time. So a yearly subscription providing those titles are included would mean massive savings for me.",,MadScorpion12,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA Access could reportedly be on the way to PlayStation 4,,,

Microsoft made a big announcement during last year’s E3 gaming expo: The tech giant confirmed the next-generation of Xbox is in development. 

Whatever comes out of the massive project - codenamed Scarlett - will be in strong competition with the hotly anticipated Sony PlayStation 5 gaming console, which may or may not be underway as well. 




Unsurprisingly, the announcement unleashed a steady stream of rumors. After hours of reading through countless reports, here are the most exciting rumored bits about the tech giant’s yet-to-be-revealed gaming rig.

There Are Two Variants on the Way

There will be not one, but two new Xbox gaming consoles, according to a report by Windows Central.
 They include an entry-level variant with the codename Lockhart, as well as a range-topping model with mode power and features. The latter carries the codename Anaconda. 
It’s all but guaranteed that the upcoming gaming consoles will offer more processing power and vastly superior graphics performance, courtesy of a dedicated GPU. The official names of both consoles are yet to be revealed, though “Microsoft Xbox Two,” with added letters depending on the model, appears to be a likely candidate.

We’ll Catch a Glimpse of It During E3 in June, But Can’t Buy It Until 2020

A recent report suggests that Microsoft will give us a glimpse of the upcoming duo of gaming consoles during this year’s E3 gaming convention. The large industry event is set to take place in Los Angeles this coming June. Sony announced that it doesn’t plan to participate, so Microsoft will deservedly be able to command all the attention. 

But rumors suggest that the gaming consoles will hit the shelves in time for the 2020 holiday shopping season. That’ll be well over a year after their allegedly scheduled unveiling, so you’ll have plenty of time to make up your mind if you want one (and to start saving up in case you do).

In the meantime, Microsoft is tipped to unveil an Xbox One S iteration without a disc drive. The gaming rig will be reasonably priced, thus giving buyers option to seamlessly access high-quality gaming and home entertainment features. We might see it make a debut as early as next month. 

Cloud-Based Gaming Will Be a Big Deal

Cloud-based gaming will be a major new feature of the next Xbox gaming console. A direct answer to Sony’s own PlayStation Now, the service will allow you to access your favorite games on devices other than your gaming console, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. 

Allegedly, the service will allow you to connect a wireless Xbox controller to your smartphone for complete gameplay control. The tech giant confirmed during E3 last year that the service is in the works. 

It’ll Have Full Backward Compatibility With Older Xbox Titles

This is hardly a surprise to us. Like all currently available Xbox One gaming consoles, their successors are rumored to have full compatibility with older gaming titles. This means that if you have amassed a vast collection of Xbox 360 and Xbox One games, you’ll be able to still access and enjoy them on the latest Microsoft hardware. 

It’ll Be Accompanied By Exclusive Gaming Titles

Like all gaming consoles by Microsoft, the next Xbox will be accompanied by an excellent selection of exclusive gaming titles, tuned to take full advantage of its cutting-edge hardware. They’ll include a new installment of the legendary Halo franchise. We wouldn’t be surprised to see a new Forza Motorsport iteration among the selection of games as well. 

You can expect the upcoming gaming titles to be compatible with Windows 10 gaming PCs as well. The feature is currently available on a number of top-rated Xbox One games, so it shouldn’t be a surprise.

It's especially crappy when I'm playing karaoke or doing a fight with a lot of qte. Once I got used to it after maybe 10 or so hours, I found out it threw off my game whenever I played my PS4 games. Also, yeah, it's terrible if you don't have good internet. Y4 had to have 25 mbps to run and still had some motion lag, and Y5 needed at least 45 just to start and if it dropped at all it had to close. Doesn't help that those are both games where you can only save in certain areas. It's also pretty crappy that PSNow gives you a time limit even if you have a paid subscription and I only found this out in Y5 after finishing a certain big event in Part 2 where I couldn't save and it closed because I was on there for a couple hours. I'd just wait for the remasters honestly. But hey, I lived through the headaches for a couple months just for those platinums.

We'll see! Hopefully! Quote: : » After watching the Google Stadia announcement I went back and read up some on what Microsoft was promising in 2013, https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/how-the-xbox-one-draws-more-processing-power-from-cloud-computing/ I'm starting to wonder if xCloud is actually their next platform. They could be fulfilling their original idea for the Xbox One, set back by the always online and DRM backlash, but given 6 extra years of development to improve it. Right now they've only been showing it off with Xbox One games, but what if their next Gen games can run fully or partially on xCloud? What if the Xbox One is forwards compatible with their next gen games, running them partially on the local hardware and partially using xCloud? They could still release a new stronger hardware that plays the games natively, or run games entirely in the cloud through an xCloud app on non-Xbox platforms. Imagine launching a next gen platform with millions of compatible hardware units already in consumers hands, and an upgrade option for those that want full native performance on those games. https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/3/15/17123452/microsoft-gaming-cloud-xbox-future https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/23/microsoft-is-building-low-cost-streaming-only-xbox-says-report/ This seems to lend support to my idea. Only thing missing is the Xbox One being potentially forwards compatible Presumably, it is part of the next platform, though it isn't ""the platform"" anymore than the backwards compatibility program is ""the platform"". There are too many people with too limited internet (on top of people with sufficiently capable internet, but service caps that are rampant in countries like the US) to exploit it properly at the current technological level (where Microsoft has described it, so far, as effectively an Xbox One S-powered server), much less the level that Microsoft will need to compete with Playstation 5 and PC advancements. This was always an issue with Gaikai/PSNow too--an interesting theory I've heard is that the whole point of PSNow was not as a replacement (pretty obvious, since it was never even capable of that for people with the best internet), but as a promotional tool: ""You've played this Playstation game on a whim, but in a very limited form. Why not commit to buying it in a much better form, i.e. non-streaming?"" Not by coincidence, Sony always leaned hard on the PS3 library for Gaikai--not only was this not easily emulated, most PS3 games are far less daunting than your average PS4 game in terms if visual fidelity (there are PS3 games in that library that look worse than their Xbox 360 counterpart, which is even older hardware). Google is probably the biggest internet technology company in the world, or very close to it. Google hasn't answered how the Stadia program will address those issues beyond the unspoken default ""It just won't work well, or at all, for millions of people."" They'll have to reconcile that at some point too, considering even their presentation of Assassin's Creed: Odyssey , on a tech floor (with absurdly good internet), technically managed to look worse than high-end consoles and have worse latency. Imagine how it'll look for someone with typical internet, and not whatever fiber connection Google was using at their own demonstration in front of thousands of developers. Imagine how much it'll cost the average consumer to have the minimum bandwidth necessary, as oppose to what they have? Microsoft has to figure this out as well. Of course, the current library model--that software will operate on earlier hardware, and not stream to it (not excluding that possibility)--may or may not allow for forwards compatibility. The-Cloud(tm) offers a novel solution to that problem. Of course, then Microsoft also has to sell new hardware to spur excitement, to attract third-party developers, and recoup the costs of 'Project Scarlet'. Streaming is potentially a really good accessory for that, if it works well, but not a good replacement. Netflix was supposed to kill all other forms of video consumption. It (or rather, media streaming in general) does dominate, but ironically, has long since added support (and actively encouraged) downloading video in advanced. And Netflix never had to contend with upload speed and latency (no one cares if Avengers: Infinity War has 300 ms lag, so long as the audio mostly matches up). It's exciting to speculate on, in any case. We could be a lot closer to an all-streaming standard, or something close to it (UHD films are selling slightly better than bluray discs did at the same point in their lifetime, thanks to a larger market worldwide), but the demand and promised video quality and low latency are rising much faster than internet service is improving for the targeted audience--and no one wants to tell people that things will need to suck so that streaming might succeed. Most people are playing Xbox One and PS4 on DSL-like connections that stutter with 1080p video. Google has been talking a really big game, way bigger than Microsoft--4K at 60hz ""to start"", and then 8K (7680x4320, or 16 times a 1080p screen) at 120 hz ""in the future"". The proposed 10 teraflop hardware will cost a few thousand dollars today , though obviously that price will (slowly) go down. But even that initial minimum would be incredibly daunting to stream at. Streaming to a switch, with its 720p 60 hz screen is a lot more realistic.

Alright, let’s tackle all three of these.

>They hate the Epic store

The Epic Games store is genuinely awful. It has terrible customer service, poor security, it lacks many of the features that Steam has, it uses REGIONAL PRICING so you’ll end up paying MORE for games depending on where you live, and the whole thing may or may not be part of a Chinese botnet. But sure, we just hate the Epic store because we “don’t like change”

>They hate Stadia

You do realize that most people don’t actually have good enough broadband for an entirely streaming based platform right? I tried out PlayStation Now, and I kept running into connection issues. It’s not for everyone. And yet, it’s being hyped up as “the future of gaming”.

>They hate VR

VR is little more than a fancy gimmick. A fancy gimmick that most people can’t actually afford because VR headsets are prohibitively expensive. In addition to that, it also requires you to have enough space to actually use the VR headset, which not everybody will have, even if they can afford to buy the headset in the first place.

Stadia is planned for launch this year and allows you to stream games across a variety of devices with very little friction. It could be a very big deal for gaming going forward. The platform aims to bring together playing, spectating, and developing games onto a single platform. As an example, you could view Assassin's Creed Odyssey on YouTube and then begin playing it through streaming in ""as little as five seconds."" Things like game updates and patches and system requirements are effectively a non-issue, because the game is running on Google's servers, rather than your local device. Google VP Phil Harrison promised the technology will work across desktops, laptops, TV, tablets, and phones. In a demonstration, the same demo was seen working across a Chromebook, smartphone, tablet, and TV, the latter through a Chromecast Ultra HDMI streamer. At launch it will stream in 4K at 60 FPS with surround sound and HDR support, and in the future Google is planning to support 8K resolution and frame-rates upwards of 120 FPS. Harrison also promised that the platform will embrace cross-platform play. You'll be able to use existing controllers on laptops and PCs, and Google will offer its own Stadia controller. The Google Stadia controller links to whichever device you're playing on, and it sports a dedicated Google Assistant button for referencing walkthrough videos if you get stuck. Gamespot . Another Gamespot article says that it doesn't work very well, even on a 20Mbps connection. ====================::==================== Quote: : No thanks. Aside from it not performing well, it's Google; they'll abandon it after a few years for a new project. Yea, the idea that you can stream 4K games at 60 fps is kinda absurd. If that was possible, Microsoft and Sony would already be doing it because it opens up their entire library of older games for subscription services. Sony already has PlayStation Now (Which I don't know much about). When you hear that DOOM didn't really work and Assassin's Creed was only OK, it's like why bother? You can just buy the game and play it locally if you want. They think that these streaming ""services"" will be the next big thing, but honestly if they are going to go that route, why not just let you pay for the service and download the full game to your hard drive? Then it will play perfectly and they can still get the monthly fee out of you.",,Evil Avatar,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,Google Announces Streaming Game Platform Stadia,,,

What I believed it was going to be a lonely experience, quickly turned into the best online experience I've ever been in. I stared the game, and after being some minutes just messing around I stumbled upon another player. At first I wasn't sure if it really was a player, but after some interactions using the sound mechanics in the game I was sure it was human. I tried to get his nametag or pretty much anything to communicate with him, but the game doesn't give you any tools to know who that player is. What followed was over an hour of just exploring and clearing levels, without any callouts, without any voice chat, without any form of communication, just the feeling of being together and not getting lost. I felt friendship, and that feeling of being alone, sorrunded by kilometers of sand, was last forgotten because I had found a new friend that probably doesn't even talk my language. After some levels, the game split us up, and I lost them. And now I'm left with the feeling of having the best and most caring player that I have ever met in my life, but I'm unable to contact him again.

Click to expand... It's not as bad as you'd think. There's a big reason why a lot of people are excited about the technology. It's gotten better and better every year to the point where major companies are jumping on board. Again, if you've seen the end of the gaming spectrum with high resolution monitors that have low response times and refresh rates, this isn't going to do anything for you. If all you're used to is playing consoles and have fast internet, this will be a way to play legit PC games on the go for cheap. With multiple platform support, this can be an easy gateway for people to get into PC gaming. Sports games are inherently laggy as is. Playing ANY NBA/Soccer/NFL game always has insane lag due to the excessive animations. I've run a lot of hours of testing on the new streaming platforms, and have come to the conclusion that only certain games are playable to a certain extent. Games that have animation lag like GTA, Diablo, and MMOs are VERY playable.",,MUSTKILL,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Google Stadia | Page 3,,,

The comparison you should be asking me to make is whats the difference in steam vs epic launch and Xbox VS playstation. Now in steam vs epic the differences are literally just installing a launch and making an account etc etc very minor things. I never said that I like the epic launcher or their buisness but to say that its the same as a console war is crazy. in xbox vs playstation has so many more things to take into account. Where do you friends play? What has a better subscription service? Which has games that you like on that system? What has the better visuals/performance? What controller do you prefer? which console UI do you like more? If you have a PC your xbox console would have some synergy with your windows 10 account. When it comes to a platform war on PC people can easily access both of them. You dont have to give up playing Counter Strike on steam with your friends in order to enjoy playing Outer Worlds. You can do both on the same PC without any extra costs involved. Want to play Halo but your friends are on playstation and you can afford only one console? there is NOTHING like that happening in steam vs epic launcher. You are still playing on PC and can enjoy whatever launchers/ platforms you want without having to give up the benefits that made you play on PC in the first place. You dont need to buy a certain GPU in order to launch steam and play steam games. There is no extra cost. To think that steam vs epic launcher is as big as Sony vs Microsoft is based on nothing but your personal feelings. Do you actually think that the average gamer is going to give a shit about Epic's practices? Considering how big fortnite is I really dont think so.

183572179627,3/19/2019,http://geekcavepodcast.tumblr.com/post/183572179627,"Your favorite search engine is taking a run at “triple-A” video games, and you won’t even need to buy a new box. 


Google announced Stadia today, which is more like Netflix than it is a PS4 or Xbox. 


 “With Google, your games will be immediately discoverable by 2 billion people on a Chrome browser, Chromebook, Chromecast, Pixel device. And we have plans to support more browsers and platforms over time,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai says. 


Essentially, if your device can run the Chrome web browser, it should - and that’s a key word there, “should” - be able to run Stadia.

The way the service works is you sign in and play games that are streaming from a server, much like the failed OnLive service or PlayStation Now. The downside is that we do not yet know how much bandwidth you’ll need… or how willing Internet Service Providers will be on allowing the service to work without either throttling it or charging you for exceeding your data cap, since Google promises 4K experiences with little-to-no latency. 


 “At launch, we’ll support being able to play games across desktops, laptops, TV, tablets, and phones. This new generation of gaming is not a box,” Google vice president Phil Harrison told Business Insider. 


Google promises you’ll be able to take your game saves, and your games, to any device. You’ll be able to use a variety of controllers, including their own, which utilizes Wi-Fi to make for less latency, and a capture button that instantly posts your gameplay on YouTube. 


The hardware Google is running the games on promises to be more powerful than the PS4 and Xbox One combined, and will reportedly “stream games in 4K, at 60 frames-per-second, with surround sound.”


Again, pricing and minimum Internet speed were not released. To compare, OnLive needed between 2 and 5 mbps.

Numbers one and two are somewhat negligible because any system can accomplish these for you. Sports games are available on all platforms. However, a psnow subscription would give you access to at least 30 must play titles as well as nearly every Lego game available for about $7ish a month. You can play the lego games with your kids. (Psnow has over 600 titles available iirc) Number 3 is the big ticket winner for ps4. Like others have said it's the best single player exclusive experience between the two. I wont list all the exclusives, but nearly every one has reviewed exceptionally well. You would truly be missing out. I own all 3 consoles since their launch. Ps4 is about 65% of my play time, Switch is 25%, and xbox with the remaining 10% If you have any specific questions let me know here.",,SpungeWorthy,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,
