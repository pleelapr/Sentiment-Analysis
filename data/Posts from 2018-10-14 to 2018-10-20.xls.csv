The real question is whether or not Microsoft will beat them to it. I highly doubt it since a lot of console games run at 30fps which is over 100ms and they add additional latency on top. PC games in the cloud IS the best case scenario due to the games running at much higher framerates. The best outcome of these current PC driven services is to have the latency of 30fps which most console gamers are used to. PSNow latency is at least 60-80ms more than this: https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...laystation-nows-ps4-game-performance-analysed Last edited: Yesterday at 7:50 PM,,thehillissilent,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Like s***. And what do you have against Xbox? Don't follow the memes, follow the actual fact that the One X is a f***ing fantastic piece of hardware, Xbox Live is leaps and bounds better than PSN, and there are actually indeed exclusives unlike what the memes will tell ya. Good ones, too. Nothing against it, just poverty has always forced me to be a single console guy; Sony is forcing me to change that by being total dogs***. PS4 is still a fairly great entertainment center tho. Ah, with how you stated it, you came off as one of those who follows the trend. Sony has had their head up their ass on so many different things in gaming this generation that it truly amazes me they are somehow ahead. Especially with how long it actually took to get exclusives releasing on PS4 that weren't just remaster of PS3 titles. I would love nothing more than for BC on PS4. They are ahead because of launch systems. Ps4 was a hundred dollars cheaper and xbox was trying to force kinect on everyone. And ps4 was stronger in specs then xbox1. Xbox got their s*** together finallybut damage done. I was a xbox fan and I went ps4 because of it all.And exclusives like spiderman and last of us where awesome and Halo got sucky.

He's also considering one for the grey tower FM Towns as well, and there's been talk of one for the Sega CD. PC Engine/TurboGrafx has the Super SD System 3 , which both provides RGB output and simulates the CD addon like an ODE would. As for the PSIO, it's not a drop-in replacement for the optical drive like the GDEMU. It was designed to live side-by-side with the existing optical drive, so you can boot from the disc, from the SD card, or from a PC via USB. An unfortunate side effect is that the installation is difficult and destructive; not only do you have to solder a bunch of wires to the underside of the motherboard, you also need to cut one or more fine traces. Personally, I wish the PSIO was more like the GDEMU and was stupidly simple to install, or perhaps only required soldering one or two wires and was thus non-destructive and reversible. I've not heard much regarding the quality of the software. Top",,Syntax,United Kingdom,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,The ODE thread,,,

At this point there are console users who were born the same year. As for your secondary account, honestly, it's hard to comment on it since we don't actually know what happened. We know you're unable to access your account, but we don't know why. I don't know if they secretly merged your accounts. I don't know if they deleted the account + all licenses tied to the account. I don't know if they separated the accounts and made it so only one can be activated at a time. I don't know if you made a mistake when entering your login data. Only thing I know is that it seems to be unrelated to the exploit allowing to crash a person's console through private messages. Edit: If the email you used for your secondary account was also used on other websites (forums, modding websites, video websites, anything), it's possible your account was locked because someone tried to ""hack"" you. One of my older email was leaked after multiple websites were hacked. Myspace, Dailymotion, Nexus mod, just so many websites were hacked and had my email shared because of it. As a result, people keep trying to hack that email on every website or game account I have. This leads to my accounts sometime being locked. If the email you used for the secondary account was used elsewhere, it's possible someone tried to do the same thing to you. Worth checking out.[/quote] Well...7 years is actually not a long time taking in mind this gen is already 5 years in. Lets take Microsoft as an example since people still talk about things that happened ages ago and to be honest rightfully so. Even new generation of gamers should know about those things and isn't something that should belong to the past. As for my other account i rechecked and even if someone tried to hack my account(which i highly doubt) at least I should get a mail or information regarding what happened. The question is....why not go with my primary account instead? that one have far more value and games. One can say that probably was my fault or that I entered the wrong password but I care a lot about my password and know exactly which password to use for each account. As a matter of fact each one is tied to an event between my past and that account so I know 100% the right password every time on every account. That account has never been used on any forums or any other place except my PS4 and PSNow as it was the account I used for testing. The games are gone from my list obviously because the account was simply removed from my PS4 and if I try to add it it won't let me. Also the password was tied to my PSNow app which auto-logged and that one now fails inmediatly because the account seems to be completely blocked. That account have 100% purchased games and zero ilegal stuff just as my main account so there is absolutely no reason. As a matter of fact I last used my PS4 to record the footage below 2 weeks ago and everything was fine otherwise I would've written a rant that day. Sure the Issue probably have nothing to do with the bug but it has a lot to do what a company do to your stuff without you knowing. I may be wrong here and I really hope so but the signs make me think that. [media=youtube]P39rgVNDNYc[/media]",,@ruantec,,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

179176722825,10/18/2018,http://brieflydeepestdreamer.tumblr.com/post/179176722825,"Google’s Video Game Streaming Service Passes the Starbucks Test https://ift.tt/2QTqfHk 
 Playing  Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey on Google’s Project Stream worked way better than I expected. It wasn’t perfect and it wasn’t the way I’d prefer to play the game, but it does make me hopeful that, in the future, I’ll just be able to play the games I want on a wide range of devices over a high speed internet connection. But we aren’t there yet.

 Project Stream is a new experiment Google is running in streaming video games to a chrome browser. Currently there’s only one game on the service:  Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. The experiment is in the beta stages right now, so it’s possible that more games will come or that Google will abandon the project altogether, as it often does. I’m in the beta and to push the tech to its limit, I did the responsible thing: I took an old Chromebook to a Starbucks to see if I could play  Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey over public Wi-Fi.

 Before I did that, I wanted to get a baseline so I streamed the game on my home desktop first. The setup was as simple as the premise. I followed a link in an email Google sent me, launched a chrome browser, and was exploring ancient Greece in just a few minutes. There was no noticeable input lag, the game ran at a solid 60 frames per second and looked gorgeous. It didn’t look or run as well as it would have on the GTX 1080 video card I have in my PC, but it wasn’t far off.

 It impressed me, but I was also running the stream on a wired ethernet connection and a decent machine. I wanted to know if the game would run as well and look as good on an old machine over public Wi-Fi. I had to give  Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey the Starbucks test.

 I hate laptops so I’ve been exclusively using Chromebooks for the past five years or so. I purchased my most recent Chromebook, a Pixel LS, in 2015. I figured if a three year old Chromebook could run  Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey over Starbucks Wi-Fi in semi-rural South Carolina, Google may have something special here.

 It ran shockingly well.

 I wasn’t comparing the streaming version to the desktop version side-by-side, but I didn’t notice a drop in the quality of the graphics or frames per second. I did have some issues though—twice during my time playing the game the graphical fidelity tanked and everything looked like a YouTube video where the buffering hasn’t quite caught up and everything becomes pixelated. The game stalled in these moments too, and I couldn’t move or do anything. Each incident lasted a few seconds before the game clicked back into smooth focus.

 This wouldn’t be my prefered way to play  Assassin’s Creed, but it is a good test case for the technology.  Assassin’s Creed is a big, beautiful game that players can take at their own pace, and no single action the player takes in it relies too heavily on perfect timing. There’s a deep combat system and the ability to sneak around and murder enemies stealthily, but you can miss a button press by a second and not break the fantasy. At this point, I don’t know if Google’s Project Stream could work for any multiplayer game, or any game that requires down to the frame precision, and those are huge categories that include some of the most successful video games in the world. For a game like  Assassin’s Creed, it seems to work, so Google was wise to use it as a first test case. 

 The other nice thing about Project Stream is that it just worked. I could rebind keys and adjust the brightness, but I couldn’t mess with any other graphics settings. It was something of a relief as I usually spend my first hour or so with any new PC game testing settings and running benchmarks. Various companies have tried to make video game streaming work. Even Sony’s PlayStation Now service lets users play PS4 games on the PS3 by streaming them, with mixed results. This is the first time I’ve played one of these services where I can actually see it being viable. And, honestly, I’m all for it. Keeping up with a gaming PC is an expensive and exhausting pain in the ass.

I was asking about the PS3, but I wanna know about them ALL, baby. OK, the ones I know of that are working 100 percent are Phoebe/Rhea for the Saturn (got these) USB-GDROM and the GDEMU for the Dreamcast (have the USB) 3DO Renovation is supposed to be good. Don't have one, as I have ZERO interest in this system. OK, then we get into the ""I dunno for sure"" about these. PSIO for the Playstation: Now, I heard about this WAY back, but the creators had a falling out...I don't even know. I've heard mixed things on it, but people complain about the software. What's the skinny? Anyone have one? PS3 Cobra: See Below I know the Phoebe guy is working on one for the PCE CD, but I honestly don't know if he's ever going to finish it. Are there any for the Gamecube? I know there aren't any for the Sega CD yet (so, I think). I love these things, with a passion. So, any being worked on? Any exciting news? I was hoping someone would come up with one for the PS2. I run games off the HDD, but it's not 100 percent. I'd prefer something better. ====================::==================== Quote: : So, the PS3 has been broken, and you can work it like the PSP with custom firmware? Is it hard to pull off? The PS3s hard drive ain't that big. Yeah, it's not too difficult. There should be plenty of guides around, Rebug is the main (only?) CFW around these days. Changing the PS3 hard drive is pretty simple, it's just a regular 2.5 inch SATA. You wanna be using a fat or slim PS3 though, not the super slim.

Lets take Microsoft as an example since people still talk about things that happened ages ago and to be honest rightfully so. Even new generation of gamers should know about those things and isn't something that should belong to the past. As for my other account i rechecked and even if someone tried to hack my account(which i highly doubt) at least I should get a mail or information regarding what happened. The question is....why not go with my primary account instead? that one have far more value and games. One can say that probably was my fault or that I entered the wrong password but I care a lot about my password and know exactly which password to use for each account. As a matter of fact each one is tied to an event between my past and that account so I know 100% the right password every time on every account. That account has never been used on any forums or any other place except my PS4 and PSNow as it was the account I used for testing. The games are gone from my list obviously because the account was simply removed from my PS4 and if I try to add it it won't let me. Also the password was tied to my PSNow app which auto-logged and that one now fails inmediatly because the account seems to be completely blocked. That account have 100% purchased games and zero ilegal stuff just as my main account so there is absolutely no reason. As a matter of fact I last used my PS4 to record the footage below 2 weeks ago and everything was fine otherwise I would've written a rant that day. Sure the Issue probably have nothing to do with the bug but it has a lot to do what a company do to your stuff without you knowing. I may be wrong here and I really hope so but the signs make me think that. Again....there is no blind hate here but extreme disappointment because is just pathetic and mind blowing to see such things happening.[/quote] It's a weird situation, I know you said their support isn't very helpful but it's still worth asking them what's happening. There's no benefit for Sony to silently remove an account like this, they don't make money from it, they don't actually gain anything from it, it simply drives people away and makes them lose money. And Sony loves money. It's quite possible their support will be incredibly unhelpful, but if you get someone helpful you might get an actual explanation on what happened.",,Thanakil,,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

This isn't the first time Rockstar Games does this, and surely not the last time. After GTA5, I doubt they feel leaving PC out of the equation worth it. sir red dead redemption 1 didn't come to pc .and huge developer to talked to rockstar to port the game for pc but they didn't reply to him. To be honest, I knew you'd jump to that argument. There's no official confirmations on it, but word goes around that the reason Red Dead Redemption didn't hit PC was its awful mess of a code. It was during the transition phase with the game-engines anyway, and every single game since then by Rockstar did come to PC. The former might even be true, considering that game never got ported to the newer generation consoles.

At this point there are console users who were born the same year. As for your secondary account, honestly, it's hard to comment on it since we don't actually know what happened. We know you're unable to access your account, but we don't know why. I don't know if they secretly merged your accounts. I don't know if they deleted the account + all licenses tied to the account. I don't know if they separated the accounts and made it so only one can be activated at a time. I don't know if you made a mistake when entering your login data. Only thing I know is that it seems to be unrelated to the exploit allowing to crash a person's console through private messages. Edit: If the email you used for your secondary account was also used on other websites (forums, modding websites, video websites, anything), it's possible your account was locked because someone tried to ""hack"" you. One of my older email was leaked after multiple websites were hacked. Myspace, Dailymotion, Nexus mod, just so many websites were hacked and had my email shared because of it. As a result, people keep trying to hack that email on every website or game account I have. This leads to my accounts sometime being locked. If the email you used for the secondary account was used elsewhere, it's possible someone tried to do the same thing to you. Worth checking out.[/quote] Well...7 years is actually not a long time taking in mind this gen is already 5 years in. Lets take Microsoft as an example since people still talk about things that happened ages ago and to be honest rightfully so. Even new generation of gamers should know about those things and isn't something that should belong to the past. As for my other account i rechecked and even if someone tried to hack my account(which i highly doubt) at least I should get a mail or information regarding what happened. The question is....why not go with my primary account instead? that one have far more value and games. One can say that probably was my fault or that I entered the wrong password but I care a lot about my password and know exactly which password to use for each account. As a matter of fact each one is tied to an event between my past and that account so I know 100% the right password every time on every account. That account has never been used on any forums or any other place except my PS4 and PSNow as it was the account I used for testing. The games are gone from my list obviously because the account was simply removed from my PS4 and if I try to add it it won't let me. Also the password was tied to my PSNow app which auto-logged and that one now fails inmediatly because the account seems to be completely blocked. That account have 100% purchased games and zero ilegal stuff just as my main account so there is absolutely no reason. As a matter of fact I last used my PS4 to record the footage below 2 weeks ago and everything was fine otherwise I would've written a rant that day. Sure the Issue probably have nothing to do with the bug but it has a lot to do what a company do to your stuff without you knowing. I may be wrong here and I really hope so but the signs make me think that.

It’s time for OITNB to say goodbye, advertisers claim Facebook lied about its video stats for over a year and we’re giving streaming games a try. Clearly, it’s Thursday morning.

Good to know.RED Hydrogen One graphic outlines the holographic phone’s specs





RED director Phil Holland published a “tech overview” infographic showing just what buyers of the company’s holographic phone will get. Some of them you may be very familiar with, such as the 5.7-inch “holographic” LCD, dual front and back cameras and the pogo pin connector for add-ons. Others may be relatively new to you, such as the 6GB of RAM, 4,500mAh battery and the “deep cavity” stereo speakers.

Enjoy ‘endless’ artist radio.Spotify Premium redesign borrows one of Pandora’s best features





Starting today, paying subscribers can enjoy streamlined navigation, personalized search and a feature called Endless Artist Radio. For that last one, just choose a favorite band or song, select the Artist Radio playlist and you’ll get an endless stream of music based on what you’ve chosen. Also, Spotify is ready for more wrists with a standalone Wear OS app that will launch in the next week.

Lies, damned lies and statistics.Facebook stands accused of lying to advertisers about video-view stats

Back in 2016, online marketing agency Crowd Siren sued the social network for inflating its metrics – now the company claims Facebook knew as early as 2015 that it was over-reporting figures.

 The social network had reported average viewing time of video ads – only counting views that lasted more than three seconds when it worked out “average duration of video viewed” – inflating the average length of a view. Facebook disclosed the issue in 2016, claiming it had “recently discovered” the error at the time. In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said, “suggestions that we in any way tried to hide this issue from our partners are false.”

Lock it down.Google details the Pixel 3’s Titan M security chip





The chip is tied into Android’s secure boot process and saves the last known-safe Android version to prevent attackers from rolling you back to an insecure firmware version. It also blocks attempts to unlock the bootloader from within Android, and no one can update your firmware unless you’ve entered your passcode. Also, apps that use Google’s StrongBox KeyStore framework can generate and store transaction keys in the secure hardware, and protected confirmation ensures that you’re the one who authorizes a payment.

Google’s Project Stream is a breath of fresh air.The next generation of streaming video games is on its way





Much like Netflix forever changed the way we consume TV and movies, Project Stream or Project xCloud could be the catalysts that usher the video-game industry into a new era of play. Thanks to Google’s game-streaming service, Jessica Conditt queued up Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on a 2015 Macbook Air and found that it worked smoothly, even though PlayStation Now frequently chugs on the same connection. The future is… now?

It may take a few days for Apple to prepare your info.Apple enables data downloads for US customers





Apple allowed its customers in the EU to download copies of the data the company held earlier this year, complying with General Data Protection Regulation rules. Now, Apple has updated its privacy website and is letting its customers in the US grab their data, too – it just may take a few days for Apple to prepare your info, but judging from our own investigations into GDPR and tech companies, Apple doesn’t hold all that much information on your digital life.

To make this more interesting, we can divide it into 3 categories: 1. Only games for that system 2. Game on system + direct backwards compatible games 3. Any game playable on that system as intended. Category 1 Only Games on System 1. PS2 2. Nintendo DS 3. PS4 4. Super Nintendo 5. Xbox 360 I think most can agree that the PS2 has one of, if not the defacto best native library of any system ever. It has an insane amount of breadth and depth as a system and covers numerous genres and has developed tons of gems that have continued to influence the industry to this day. The Nintendo DS has done the same but for handheld gaming. Category 2 Games on System + Backwards 1. 3DS + DS 2. PS2 + PS1 3. DS + GBA 4. Xbox One + Xbox 360 + Xbox 5. PS3 + PS2 Many great options here but I'll give it to the 3DS and DS with so so many strong entries. The DS library is one of the strongest of all time and augmented with the 3DS library, I think it takes the cake here. PS2 > DS but I'd say 3DS library is better than the PS1. DS + GBA is also a really strong contender here as well. Category 3 All Games on System 1. 3DS + DS + VC 2. PS4 + PSClassics + PSNow 3. PS2 + PS1 4. DS + GBA 5. Xbox One + Xbox 360 + Xbox For the everything goes round, the 3DS + DS grows stronger with the addition of the VC which adds the legendary Nintendo classic games from Super Mario World to Pokemon Red and Blue, I think this blows everything else away. I think PS4 steps up with the power of games available on PSNow and Classics platform that I believe edges it over the PS2 + PS1 combo.",,MasterFox72,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

PlayStation Now: the streaming service for video games. Or one of them, at least.

Real-time game streaming isn’t quite the fantastical pipe dream it was even a few years ago. Google is now trialling streams of AAA games to its Chrome browser. Microsoft is planning a streaming-only Xbox console, code-named Xbox Scarlett Cloud. Even the far less powerful hardware of the Nintendo Switch is getting…

It is very similar to DQ XI in some ways (obv. different in others). But if you enjoyed XI, there is a good chance it will sit well with you. Persona might be hit-or-miss, depends how you feel about setting and art style. The systems are more complicated. And there is far less a sense of exploration and adventure. But on plus side has monster fusion, weakness systems, time management stuff. Ni no kuni 1/2 also get mentioned, but I think it depends on which elements of XI attracted you the most. Nnk1 is only ps3 (maybe psnow?) And nnk2 is ps4/pc but does not require playing nnk1. Trails in the Sky is a really fun series. It's probably my favorite after Dragon Quest. You have a similar sense of exploration as you walk through a kingdom on a quest. Where it excels is in worldbuilding. It took the idea of NPCs and makes them living characters in their own right. You arent the chosen one and really most of the first game you are a trainee. Somehow it reminds me of the old dragon ball manga. Of all of these, I most recommend DQ VIII or Trails in the Sky FC.

Good ones, too. Nothing against it, just poverty has always forced me to be a single console guy; Sony is forcing me to change that by being total dogs***. PS4 is still a fairly great entertainment center tho. Ah, with how you stated it, you came off as one of those who follows the trend. Sony has had their head up their ass on so many different things in gaming this generation that it truly amazes me they are somehow ahead.

I initially started off wanting to play Red Dead Redemption. But I noticed Last of Us is on the service. The recent gameplay video for LoU 2 was pretty fascinating so I gave it a try... It's pretty good. The story interesting. But I got done with the Suburbs and holy !@#!@!!!! Spoiler: show I figured one or both were going to die, but wtf?!? I did not expect that. Well not until Sam raised his pant leg to show the bite. Then I was like ""nope, Henry won't be able to handle it."" But it was still pretty shocking. I was also pretty taken by the death of Tess. I mean, I figured that character was going to die, but i was starting to like her and then... On the other hand, I was not at all surprised Bill lived. Anyway, this is a pretty heavy, but interesting game.

You're right wasn't marketed well at all. Also though the console making companies, who then give game developers buisness alltogether have no interest in seeing streaming succeed, because the sales of hardware and the physical copy game disappears and probably worked against this somehow. They are only now coming out with thier own services to try to develop propriatary services and monetize them. Nobody has really tried 100%. Remember Steam machines?

179152408350,10/17/2018,http://engadget-in-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/179152408350,"There’s a specific kind of frustration associated with crappy game-streaming services. It’s all about the build-up – you find a game, whether it’s something brand new or a long-lost childhood favorite, and boot it up. It takes forever to load. The title screen stutters and your heart drops, but it’s easy to convince yourself it was just a bout of preliminary jitters.

And then the game begins. And stops. And starts up again. And stops. The dialogue is chopped, animations are disconnected and any type of action scene is impossible to control. Your character is killed five times in ten minutes, and you’re simultaneously filled with rage and an acute sense of loss. You exit out of the streaming service and spend the night playing Fortnite again.

That’s been the story with so many streaming services over the years, from OnLive to GeForce Now. However, this entire ecosystem is poised to change. After years of impossible promises and half-baked public trials in an incomplete online ecosystem, streaming services are finally viable, and major companies like Google and Microsoft are teasing the future of the industry.





Earlier this month, Google launched the beta for Project Stream, a service that pledges to seamlessly run any video game on any laptop or PC.

We’ve heard this promise before, but it looks like Google actually gets it done. The Project Stream beta is limited to one title for now, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, a massive open-world game that landed this month across all modern platforms. And, apparently, in the Chrome browser of my 2015 MacBook Air.

After checking my internet connection – Google recommends at least 25 megabits per second – Project Stream booted up the new Assassin’s Creed and I was instantly transported to a mountainous battlefield in ancient Greece. The game performed beautifully, with slight popping and pixelation every now and then, but rarely to the point of interrupting the actual gameplay.

I played Odyssey for a few hours in two separate locations and saw the same results: The game stopped once at each locale (my house and my dad’s), complete with a page saying I needed a stronger internet connection to continue.

Each time, Project Stream ran a connection check, and after a few minutes, everything was back up to par. I resumed my game from right where I’d left off (wildly flailing my sword at hordes of sandaled enemies) and didn’t experience any interruptions afterward. My internet connection was just strong enough to sustain Project Stream, and a small yellow icon at the bottom right of the screen reminded me that, because of this fact, the game could pause at any moment.

However, after those initial pauses, it didn’t. The actual game ran smoothly and only stopped when my connection became too precarious to continue, keeping the core experience completely intact. It never felt like Project Stream was impeding my gameplay in any way.

This is a remarkable achievement, especially considering how Sony’s streaming service, PlayStation Now, chugs on my home internet connection, making even a game like Lego Harry Potter unplayable. And that’s on the PS4, a console that’s built to run the latest and greatest AAA games around. With Project Stream, my internet connection was the problem, while the service itself ran Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in the Chrome browser of my MacBook Air with aplomb.





Google isn’t the only company making huge strides in video game streaming – Microsoft recently revealed Project xCloud, a service with a distinct emphasis on bringing AAA games to mobile devices.

“Ultimately, Project xCloud is about providing gamers – whether they prefer console or PC – new choices in when and where they play, while giving mobile-only players access to worlds, characters and immersive stories they haven’t been able to experience before,” Microsoft CVP of cloud gaming Kareem Choudhry explained in a blog post.

Microsoft says Project xCloud will theoretically work with every game from the Xbox One onward, bringing these experiences to laptops, outdated PCs, tablets and smartphones with ease. Streaming is a massive part of Microsoft’s plans for the next Xbox, with reports that the company is building two new consoles, one of which is designed specifically for streaming.





The backbone of Project xCloud is a series of high-powered, custom-built servers within the Azure network, and this infrastructure – combined with years of internal R&D – gives Microsoft an advantage in the streaming business, at least on paper. It plans to roll out a public beta for Project xCloud in 2019, while the new Xboxes are expected to land in 2020.

Meanwhile, Sony has been improving PlayStation Now on the consumer side, rolling out the option to download games and play them offline, which negates the low-quality streaming blues. With the next PlayStation console just around the corner, executives are surely deciding how much of a role streaming will play in the coming generation.

“If you look back at console gaming history, there are certain inflection points that allow for the industry to be upended and for new participants to emerge,” former Sony Interactive Entertainment chief Andrew House said in April. “One of those is when you have a wholesale shift in the distribution method. …So, other than the technical challenges, there’s no reason why game streaming can’t be present in games in the same way that we have seen in the music and film and television industries.”





Much like Netflix forever changed the way we consume TV and movies, Project Stream, Project xCloud or whatever Sony cooks up could be the catalyst that ushers the video game industry into a new era of play. However, game discs aren’t going anywhere just yet – it’ll likely take a handful of years and at least one more console generation before streaming surpasses local downloads as the norm.

There’s room for all of these services, and others, to succeed. When it comes to video game streaming, the near future finally looks bright.",,engadget-in-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,The next generation of streaming video games is on its way,Post,,

If your PC can handle HD video streaming then it should be able to handle PSNow. As to x360ce; I think you should be able to set it up the same way you would with any other game, by moving the files into the PSNow folder. If all else fails, you should be able to configure the controller and launch PSNow through Steam. I don't think there's a comprehensive list of games which use the gyroscope or touch pad, but there are a few. IIRC, the roadblock for Heavy Rain involves brushing your teeth by shaking the controller side to side. In Last of Us you use motion controls to recharge your flashlight, but there's also a passive recharge so it's not strictly necessary. In Beyond Two Souls it's used during QTE; I don't think you can finish the game without motion controls. There are relatively few games which require the gyroscope, and the touchpad is only ever used in PS4 games. If you have some extra money, the Dualshock 4 is actually a pretty good controller for PC games, so you might consider buying one just so you don't have to worry about it.",,Cornthulhu,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Lets take Microsoft as an example since people still talk about things that happened ages ago and to be honest rightfully so. Even new generation of gamers should know about those things and isn't something that should belong to the past. As for my other account i rechecked and even if someone tried to hack my account(which i highly doubt) at least I should get a mail or information regarding what happened. The question is....why not go with my primary account instead? that one have far more value and games. One can say that probably was my fault or that I entered the wrong password but I care a lot about my password and know exactly which password to use for each account. As a matter of fact each one is tied to an event between my past and that account so I know 100% the right password every time on every account. That account has never been used on any forums or any other place except my PS4 and PSNow as it was the account I used for testing. The games are gone from my list obviously because the account was simply removed from my PS4 and if I try to add it it won't let me. Also the password was tied to my PSNow app which auto-logged and that one now fails inmediatly because the account seems to be completely blocked. That account have 100% purchased games and zero ilegal stuff just as my main account so there is absolutely no reason. As a matter of fact I last used my PS4 to record the footage below 2 weeks ago and everything was fine otherwise I would've written a rant that day. Sure the Issue probably have nothing to do with the bug but it has a lot to do what a company do to your stuff without you knowing. I may be wrong here and I really hope so but the signs make me think that. Again....there is no blind hate here but extreme disappointment because is just pathetic and mind blowing to see such things happening.[/quote] It's a weird situation, I know you said their support isn't very helpful but it's still worth asking them what's happening. There's no benefit for Sony to silently remove an account like this, they don't make money from it, worse they'll lose money by losing a paying customer. It's quite possible their support will be incredibly unhelpful, but if you get someone helpful you might get an actual explanation on what happened.",,Thanakil,,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

This is more a risky investment as the company went public only last year and the value is very low(.10). There are safer and more established companies that dominate the market right now and have very high value. Companies like Blizzard(ATVI), EA(EA), Take-Two(TTWO). All are great companies to invest in. But if your looking for a home run type of company here is what I found for Millennial Esports(I hate the company name by the way...) here is a link to company details. I hope it works for people that don't have an account on the site...let me know if it doesn't https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-services/tsxv-game/millennial-esports-shares. This company mainly manages esports events. Creates mobile games. and provides statistical data for other gaming company. Date Revenue Net Income * 2018-05-31 2.22 -6.56 2018-02-28 1.34 -10.14 2017-11-30 0.82 -10.88 2017-08-31 0.31 -10.06 2017-05-31 0.37 -5.52 2017-02-28 0.25 -2.40 2016-11-30 0.24 -1.84 2016-08-31 0.21 -0.99 2016-05-31 0.04 -1.13 2015-08-31 0.02 -1.12 2014-08-31 0.00 -0.72 The company currently doesn't have positive earnings. You can see that lately the net income has gone down more and the revenue increased a bit. The reason for this is that the company has recently shifted to mainly focusing on racing esports. The companies main source of income in the past has been from running esports events in an arena they rent out in vegas. They are still doing this today but they made some big changes recently. The biggest one is buying ownership of EDEN GAMES. This company develops racing games. It made Test Drive Unlimited Series and V-Rally Series for playstation. Now it develops mobile games(Gear.Club and just released F1 mobile Racing today with the company Codemasters). It also has an exclussive game coming out on the Switch on Dec 4th(Gear.Club unlimited 2). In acquiring Eden Games the company has said that its future focus will be on growing mobile racing as an esport. Their game has recently been added to Amazon Go eSport tournaments and they will be using their own arena they have in vegas to run events. Looking at the stock value. You can see when it initally went public the volume of trades was very high and the stock raised as high as a dollar before crashing down to .10 where it sits now. This looks like it was a big pump and dump. But the stock has been sitting at or close to its current value for a while. For a company like this it comes down to if you see any value in mobile racing as an esport or as a good way to generate revenue. There last financial report was in May shortly after they aquired Eden Games. The main source of revenue at this point was from game development and any revenue that gear.club(and old mobile game developed by EDEN games a couple years back). The next financial will be at the end of the year. The main source will be from royalties they make from the F1 Mobile Racing game, gear.club unlimitted 2 being released in Dec, and development for new games coming out in 2019. The value being so low isn't taking into account the potential future of the company. So if someone is interested in investing in this company I suggest looking up past racing mobile games to see how popular they were and how much revenue you would expect coming in from games that Millennial Esports will be releasing. And most of all if you think that racing games have any kind of future in esports.",,tony905,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The most popular include GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky.

Good ones, too. Nothing against it, just poverty has always forced me to be a single console guy; Sony is forcing me to change that by being total dogs***. PS4 is still a fairly great entertainment center tho. Ah, with how you stated it, you came off as one of those who follows the trend. Sony has had their head up their ass on so many different things in gaming this generation that it truly amazes me they are somehow ahead. Especially with how long it actually took to get exclusives releasing on PS4 that weren't just remaster of PS3 titles. I would love nothing more than for BC on PS4. They are ahead because of launch systems. Ps4 was a hundred dollars cheaper and xbox was trying to force kinect on everyone. And ps4 was stronger in specs then xbox1.

179113056967,10/16/2018,http://the-gadgeteer.tumblr.com/post/179113056967,"NEWS – People are already accustomed to streaming TV shows and movies, and Xbox is bringing that capability to games, too. There’s no word yet on pricing for Xbox’s game-streaming option — known as Project xCloud — but the brand plans to launch public trials of the service next year.

Open to Third-Party Developers

In June 2018, people who attended the E3 technology conference heard from Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s vice president of gaming, that Microsoft intended to bring Xbox games to mobile devices. Project xCloud is the result of those efforts.

Early details indicate game developers could put content on the streaming service. That would mean people would not be limited to interacting with first-party titles. According to a blog post about the service, developers “will be able to deploy and dramatically scale access to their games across all devices on Project xCloud with no additional work.”

The Mobile Availability Could Be a Competitive Advantage

The part of the quote above that references being able to use Project xCloud on all devices is significant. PlayStation Now is another major entity in the streaming game market. But, people who subscribe to that service can only interact with the content on a PlayStation 4 console or a PC.

Notably, more than a minute’s worth of a YouTube video Microsoft released about Project xCloud discusses how its service will not be device-dependent. So, anyone in the world with a device capable of handling streaming content could use the technology.

Some Hardware Is Already in Place

Microsoft has some of the console hardware for Project xCloud installed in one of its data centers now. Moreover, the company broke down an Xbox console into its separate components. The purpose was to build a “blade unit” capable of hosting numerous Xbox systems simultaneously, as well as the necessary infrastructure.

Multiple Ways to Play

Besides being able to get engrossed in Xbox games on any device, people who use Project xCloud won’t even need controllers. Indeed, one way to interact with the games is to connect a wireless controller to a Bluetooth-compatible device. Microsoft demonstrated that option in its YouTube video.

Information has also emerged about a game-specific, touch-sensitive overlay that allows playing the games controller-free. In that setup, buttons might appear on a tablet and respond when a person presses them, making that Project xCloud possibility particularly attractive for people on the go and traveling light.

Rumors and Speculation Are Rampant

Microsoft still needs to publicize crucial details about Project xCloud, such as the cost and the available library of games. Due to those unknown factors, people are weighing in with their thoughts rapidly. For example, some people think Project xCloud will not be fee-based and could target people who subscribe to Xbox Gold.

Such a subscription gives people access to advanced multiplayer games on their consoles. Some individuals think Microsoft might position Project xCloud as a free extra for Xbox Gold subscribers.

Also, Microsoft’s answer to PlayStation Now is Xbox Live. It allows people to browse from an ever-growing library of games, then download and play them as often as they’d like. The prevalent assumption is that Project xCloud wouldn’t replace Xbox Live.

What Sets Project xCloud Apart From the Pack So Far?

Despite the lack of concrete details, there is something exceptionally significant that differentiates Project xCloud from other offerings available from Xbox or otherwise: the ability to play on any device. It’s not difficult to see how that benefit opens gaming to people around the world who can’t afford consoles.

In India, for example, stores sell both consoles and games at a significant markup compared to their U.S. counterparts. Also, the country doesn’t benefit from Black Friday sales that could make game equipment more affordable for a small window of time. It doesn’t help that professionals in India earn less than people in numerous other countries, either.

But, if Project xCloud offers people the chance to access a library of games and never buy a console, a monthly rate for the service could make such entertainment affordable in India and elsewhere. It’s worth remembering Playstation Now allows console-less playing, too, if people use their PCs.

Smartphones are especially ubiquitous, though, making the availability of Project xCloud on those devices seem like an undoubtedly positive point. One report predicts there will be 5.5 billion smartphone users by 2021. To put that another way, only 5.3 billion people in the global population can get running water.

Device Independence Could Accelerate Gaming’s Appeal

It’s too soon to say when Project xCloud will get its first paid subscribers or how much they should expect to get charged. However, being able to play Xbox games on any device could make them more accessible forms of entertainment, both for experienced gamers and the casually curious.

Lets take Microsoft as an example since people still talk about things that happened ages ago and to be honest rightfully so. Even new generation of gamers should know about those things and isn't something that should belong to the past. As for my other account i rechecked and even if someone tried to hack my account(which i highly doubt) at least I should get a mail or information regarding what happened. The question is....why not go with my primary account instead? that one have far more value and games. One can say that probably was my fault or that I entered the wrong password but I care a lot about my password and know exactly which password to use for each account. As a matter of fact each one is tied to an event between my past and that account so I know 100% the right password every time on every account. That account has never been used on any forums or any other place except my PS4 and PSNow as it was the account I used for testing. The games are gone from my list obviously because the account was simply removed from my PS4 and if I try to add it it won't let me. Also the password was tied to my PSNow app which auto-logged and that one now fails inmediatly because the account seems to be completely blocked. That account have 100% purchased games and zero ilegal stuff just as my main account so there is absolutely no reason. As a matter of fact I last used my PS4 to record the footage below 2 weeks ago and everything was fine otherwise I would've written a rant that day. Sure the Issue probably have nothing to do with the bug but it has a lot to do what a company do to your stuff without you knowing. I may be wrong here and I really hope so but the signs make me think that. Again....there is no blind hate here but extreme disappointment because is just pathetic and mind blowing to see such things happening.[/quote] It's a weird situation, I know you said their support isn't very helpful but it's still worth asking them what's happening. There's no benefit for Sony to silently remove an account like this, they don't make money from it, worse they lose money by losing a paying customer account. It's quite possible their support will be incredibly unhelpful, but if you get someone helpful you might get an actual explanation on what happened.",,Thanakil,,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

At this point there are console users who were born the same year. As for your secondary account, honestly, it's hard to comment on it since we don't actually know what happened. We know you're unable to access your account, but we don't know why. I don't know if they secretly merged your accounts. I don't know if they deleted the account + all licenses tied to the account. I don't know if they separated the accounts and made it so only one can be activated at a time. I don't know if you made a mistake when entering your login data. Only thing I know is that it seems to be unrelated to the exploit allowing to crash a person's console through private messages. Edit: If the email you used for your secondary account was also used on other websites (forums, modding websites, video websites, anything), it's possible your account was locked because someone tried to ""hack"" you. One of my older email was leaked after multiple websites were hacked. Myspace, Dailymotion, Nexus mod, just so many websites were hacked and had my email shared because of it. As a result, people keep trying to hack that email on every website or game account I have. This leads to my accounts sometime being locked. If the email you used for the secondary account was used elsewhere, it's possible someone tried to do the same thing to you. Worth checking out.[/quote] Well...7 years is actually not a long time taking in mind this gen is already 5 years in. Lets take Microsoft as an example since people still talk about things that happened ages ago and to be honest rightfully so. Even new generation of gamers should know about those things and isn't something that should belong to the past. As for my other account i rechecked and even if someone tried to hack my account(which i highly doubt) at least I should get a mail or information regarding what happened. The question is....why not go with my primary account instead? that one have far more value and games. One can say that probably was my fault or that I entered the wrong password but I care a lot about my password and know exactly which password to use for each account. As a matter of fact each one is tied to an event between my past and that account so I know 100% the right password every time on every account. The games are gone from my list obviously because the account was simply removed from my PS4 and if I try to add it it won't let me. Also the password was tied to my PSNow app which auto-logged and that one now fails inmediatly because the account seems to be completely blocked. That account have 100% purchased games and zero ilegal stuff just as my main account so there is absolutely no reason. As a matter of fact I last used my PS4 to record the footage below 2 weeks ago and everything was fine otherwise I would've written a rant that day. Sure the Issue probably have nothing to do with the bug but it has a lot to do what a company do to your stuff without you knowing.

At the annual E3 trade show in June, Microsoft hinted at some kind of streaming service. Now it has a name (albeit a seemingly temporary one): Project xCloud.

The service is pretty much what you’d expect if you’ve been following all the chatter around game streaming. With xCloud, Xbox people will be able to play their games on a variety of different screens, from PC monitors to smartphones.

SEE ALSO: This greaseproof Xbox One controller needs to become the standard

It’s a streaming thing, to be clear. Don’t confuse this with two other existing Microsoft offerings that give you access to Xbox games. Xbox Play Anywhere is more feature than service; most first-party Xbox games — which is to say, those made by Microsoft-owned studios — can be installed and played via the Windows 10 store, provided they support Play Anywhere.

Xbox Game Pass, on the other hand, is a monthly subscription service that gives members access to a library of games supported by Xbox. Many of the titles available are first-party releases, but not all of them. More importantly: Game Pass titles need to be downloaded and installed. No streaming here.

Project xCloud is more like a Netflix or — for the deep-cut PC gamers out there — OnLive. The hardware required to run a Halo or Gears of War is off in a data center somewhere, and the images you see on your screen are beamed there while your controller inputs are sent back to the data center and processed there.

It’s not new technology (see also: OnLive, Gaikai), but it’s never really been perfected. But some big companies are betting on streaming games now. PlayStation Now launched in 2015, though it focuses more on older games and is only available on PlayStation 4 and PC.

Google has a streaming games product of its own in development, Project Stream. It’s the company’s first real entry into the gaming space, but it’s not actually available yet. Nvidia’s GeForce Now service is similar in that it’s not out yet, but this one is built to stream games installed on your main PC.

Project xCloud, then, is Microsoft’s take on game streaming. A trailer runs through exactly how that works: Custom data centers equipped with rack-mounted units that each contain the guts of multiple Xbox One consoles.



It’s mostly talk at this point. Microsoft plans to start conducting public tests in 2019, but this video raises more questions than it answers. We’ll need to know what the price is, what the game library looks like, and how xCloud works with your save data (or not) if you also play games on an actual Xbox.

It’s clear from the trailer that game streaming will be supported on PC and mobile — definitely Android (it’s mentioned in the trailer) and likely iOS, given Apple’s ubiquity. Presumably, some kind of xCloud app will be available for Xbox consoles as well. 

Don’t expect PlayStation to join the party, but Switch is a possibility. Nintendo’s demonstrated a willingness to work with its competitors in the console space, as evidenced by the Switch supporting cross-platform play in Fortnite and Minecraft.

Microsoft expects to start letting users in to text xCloud sometime in 2019. We’ll probably start hearing more about how the service around this streaming tech will work once the Xbox maker has a better sense of how the service actually works and is consumed by subscribers.

These yearly Forza games are OK I guess, but for years now, these yearly Forza games have only seemed to slow the rate at which the Xbone is being curbed stomped...... slightly. M$ has cancelled games, closed down multiple studios, killed off the Integral Kinect that they said would never be sold without the Xbone and still hasn't delivered on their ""Infinite Cloud Power"" that they were so adamant about in the beginning. I guess gamers in general are a little too savvy to buy into this snake oil when for years, said snake oil hasn't been shown or even spoken about by M$ since they initially brought it up. Is it all just a big coincidence that M$ continues to lose globally, month after month since the start of this generation, and that it is now trailing it's main competitor by over 40 MILLION? Discuss. Gamers are looking to the future. Eurogamer and experts believe the next gen battle is between google and ms. They dont mention Sony and Nintendo. AT. ALL. Because Sony and Nintendo will be making traditional consoles. Google and Xbox will be slap-fighting over streaming games. Sony started streaming well before MS on multiple devices. Correct, we're over 6 years since sony purchased gakai and coming up on 5 years since Sony demoed PSNow and it still isn't on every device ever made.

At this point there are console users who were born the same year. As for your secondary account, honestly, it's hard to comment on it since we don't actually know what happened. We know you're unable to access your account, but we don't know why. I don't know if they secretly merged your accounts. I don't know if they deleted the account + all licenses tied to the account. I don't know if they separated the accounts and made it so only one can be activated at a time. I don't know if you made a mistake when entering your login data. Only thing I know is that it seems to be unrelated to the exploit allowing to crash a person's console through private messages. Edit: If the email you used for your secondary account was also used on other websites (forums, modding websites, video websites, anything), it's possible your account was locked because someone tried to ""hack"" you. One of my older email was leaked after multiple websites were hacked. Myspace, Dailymotion, Nexus mod, just so many websites were hacked and had my email shared because of it. As a result, people keep trying to hack that email on every website or game account I have. This leads to my accounts sometime being locked. If the email you used for the secondary account was used elsewhere, it's possible someone tried to do the same thing to you. Worth checking out.[/quote] Well...7 years is actually not a long time taking in mind this gen is already 5 years in. Lets take Microsoft as an example since people still talk about things that happened ages ago and to be honest rightfully so. Even new generation of gamers should know about those things and isn't something that should belong to the past. As for my other account i rechecked and even if someone tried to hack my account(which i highly doubt) at least I should get a mail or information regarding what happened. The question is....why not go with my primary account instead? that one have far more value and games. One can say that probably was my fault or that I entered the wrong password but I care a lot about my password and know exactly which password to use for each account. As a matter of fact each one is tied to an event between my past and that account so I know 100% the right password every time on every account. The games are gone from my list obviously because the account was simply removed from my PS4 and if I try to add it it won't let me. Also the password was tied to my PSNow app which auto-logged and that one now fails inmediatly because the account seems to be completely blocked. That account have 100% purchased games and zero ilegal stuff just as my main account so there is absolutely no reason. As a matter of fact I last used my PS4 to record the footage below 2 weeks ago and everything was fine otherwise I would've written a rant that day: [media=youtube]P39rgVNDNYc[/media]",,@ruantec,,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Are there any for the Gamecube? I know there aren't any for the Sega CD yet (so, I think). I love these things, with a passion. So, any being worked on? Any exciting news?

I'd prefer something better. ====================::==================== Quote: : Quote: : What's the difference between an ODE and a softmodded console running a game off of the hard drive? Nothing at all. So, the PS3 has been broken, and you can work it like the PSP? Is it hard to pull off? The PS3s hard drive ain't that big. As long as you aren't on 4.83 firmware, which was literally just released, you'd have to have updated your PS3 within the last week. Anything below that can be manually updated to 4.82. Installing the CFW is easy, you put some files on a flash drive and go to a website on the PS3 browser and follow the directions. Spoofing for PSN access is maybe a bit more difficult just because you should read up extensively so you don't get banned. The most annoying thing I've heard is the USB ports can only read a FAT32 flash drive, which can only have files up to 4GB in size- i.e. you have to transfer disc games over FTP, or split files and then rejoin them on the console, or use an external NTFS hard drive and run a program when you start your PS3.

Maybe those that are paying for Xbox Live, PSNow, and Nintendo's service feel like they are actually getting their money's worth, which is why they continue paying for those respective services. Personally, I don't buy too many games for various reasons; lack of time, cost of games going up in Canada due to the exchange rates, unwillingness to spend $80 plus 13% tax on a game I'm not quite sure about, etc. With that in mind, I'm also subbed to Xbox Live until December 2020 thanks to Bing Rewards. That's at least 96 free game for me; half of them I get to keep. Sure, some of those games I will find awful, but there will be some good games like: MGS5Tomb Raider: DE, Rayman Legends, Assassin's Creed: Syndicate / Black Flag And ones I would have never purchased but ended up really enjoying; for example, Valiant Hearts, Oxenfree, The Witness, Victor Vran, Murdered: Soul Suspect, Child of Light, etc.",,pizzatarian,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

179152517819,10/17/2018,http://mrcifci.tumblr.com/post/179152517819,"Engadget 
There’s a specific kind of frustration associated with crappy game-streaming services. It’s all about the build-up – you find a game, whether it’s something brand new or a long-lost childhood favorite, and boot it up. It takes forever to load. The title screen stutters and your heart drops, but it’s easy to convince yourself it was just a bout of preliminary jitters.

And then the game begins. And stops. And starts up again. And stops. The dialogue is chopped, animations are disconnected and any type of action scene is impossible to control. Your character is killed five times in ten minutes, and you’re simultaneously filled with rage and an acute sense of loss. You exit out of the streaming service and spend the night playing Fortnite again.

That’s been the story with so many streaming services over the years, from OnLive to GeForce Now. However, this entire ecosystem is poised to change. After years of impossible promises and half-baked public trials in an incomplete online ecosystem, streaming services are finally viable, and major companies like Google and Microsoft are teasing the future of the industry.



Earlier this month, Google launched the beta for Project Stream, a service that pledges to seamlessly run any video game on any laptop or PC.

We’ve heard this promise before, but it looks like Google actually gets it done. The Project Stream beta is limited to one title for now, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, a massive open-world game that landed this month across all modern platforms. And, apparently, in the Chrome browser of my 2015 MacBook Air.

After checking my internet connection – Google recommends at least 25 megabits per second – Project Stream booted up the new Assassin’s Creed and I was instantly transported to a mountainous battlefield in ancient Greece. The game performed beautifully, with slight popping and pixelation every now and then, but rarely to the point of interrupting the actual gameplay.

I played Odyssey for a few hours in two separate locations and saw the same results: The game stopped once at each locale (my house and my dad’s), complete with a page saying I needed a stronger internet connection to continue.

Each time, Project Stream ran a connection check, and after a few minutes, everything was back up to par. I resumed my game from right where I’d left off (wildly flailing my sword at hordes of sandaled enemies) and didn’t experience any interruptions afterward. My internet connection was just strong enough to sustain Project Stream, and a small yellow icon at the bottom right of the screen reminded me that, because of this fact, the game could pause at any moment.

However, after those initial pauses, it didn’t. The actual game ran smoothly and only stopped when my connection became too precarious to continue, keeping the core experience completely intact. It never felt like Project Stream was impeding my gameplay in any way.

This is a remarkable achievement, especially considering how Sony’s streaming service, PlayStation Now, chugs on my home internet connection, making even a game like Lego Harry Potter unplayable. And that’s on the PS4, a console that’s built to run the latest and greatest AAA games around. With Project Stream, my internet connection was the problem, while the service itself ran Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in the Chrome browser of my MacBook Air with aplomb.



Google isn’t the only company making huge strides in video game streaming – Microsoft recently revealed Project xCloud, a service with a distinct emphasis on bringing AAA games to mobile devices.

“Ultimately, Project xCloud is about providing gamers – whether they prefer console or PC – new choices in when and where they play, while giving mobile-only players access to worlds, characters and immersive stories they haven’t been able to experience before,” Microsoft CVP of cloud gaming Kareem Choudhry explained in a blog post.

Microsoft says Project xCloud will theoretically work with every game from the Xbox One onward, bringing these experiences to laptops, outdated PCs, tablets and smartphones with ease. Streaming is a massive part of Microsoft’s plans for the next Xbox, with reports that the company is building two new consoles, one of which is designed specifically for streaming.



The backbone of Project xCloud is a series of high-powered, custom-built servers within the Azure network, and this infrastructure – combined with years of internal R&D – gives Microsoft an advantage in the streaming business, at least on paper. It plans to roll out a public beta for Project xCloud in 2019, while the new Xboxes are expected to land in 2020.

Meanwhile, Sony has been improving PlayStation Now on the consumer side, rolling out the option to download games and play them offline, which negates the low-quality streaming blues. With the next PlayStation console just around the corner, executives are surely deciding how much of a role streaming will play in the coming generation.

“If you look back at console gaming history, there are certain inflection points that allow for the industry to be upended and for new participants to emerge,” former Sony Interactive Entertainment chief Andrew House said in April. “One of those is when you have a wholesale shift in the distribution method. …So, other than the technical challenges, there’s no reason why game streaming can’t be present in games in the same way that we have seen in the music and film and television industries.”



Much like Netflix forever changed the way we consume TV and movies, Project Stream, Project xCloud or whatever Sony cooks up could be the catalyst that ushers the video game industry into a new era of play. However, game discs aren’t going anywhere just yet – it’ll likely take a handful of years and at least one more console generation before streaming surpasses local downloads as the norm.

There’s room for all of these services, and others, to succeed. When it comes to video game streaming, the near future finally looks bright.",,mrcifci,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,The next generation of streaming video games is on its way,Post,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== errrrmmrrrgrrrd",,Von_Till,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

Subscription for internet services Subscription for streaming services like psnow and playstation view This takes a hit if people aren’t buying consoles to play with them heir friends or what not. So how do we get it? My thought is don’t makes very little off game sales, those profits go to devs. So Sony/Microsoft then come up with a number they charge devs to allow that game to have crossplay. Some games like COD can afford to pay it, but will they want to risk people not buying multiple copies for different platforms? Others can’t afford to pay it do to their size. So either way this puts the blame back on the devs and not on Sony/Microsoft. They can say hey we want it as much as you, but your devs won’t pay us and t requires man hours to make it work.

179152033267,10/17/2018,http://immedtech.tumblr.com/post/179152033267,"There’s a specific kind of frustration associated with crappy game-streaming services. It’s all about the build-up – you find a game, whether it’s something brand new or a long-lost childhood favorite, and boot it up. It takes forever to load. The title screen stutters and your heart drops, but it’s easy to convince yourself it was just a bout of preliminary jitters.

And then the game begins. And stops. And starts up again. And stops. The dialogue is chopped, animations are disconnected and any type of action scene is impossible to control. Your character is killed five times in ten minutes, and you’re simultaneously filled with rage and an acute sense of loss. You exit out of the streaming service and spend the night playing Fortnite again.

That’s been the story with so many streaming services over the years, from OnLive to GeForce Now. However, this entire ecosystem is poised to change. After years of impossible promises and half-baked public trials in an incomplete online ecosystem, streaming services are finally viable, and major companies like Google and Microsoft are teasing the future of the industry.



Earlier this month, Google launched the beta for Project Stream, a service that pledges to seamlessly run any video game on any laptop or PC.

We’ve heard this promise before, but it looks like Google actually gets it done. The Project Stream beta is limited to one title for now, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, a massive open-world game that landed this month across all modern platforms. And, apparently, in the Chrome browser of my 2015 MacBook Air.

After checking my internet connection – Google recommends at least 25 megabits per second – Project Stream booted up the new Assassin’s Creed and I was instantly transported to a mountainous battlefield in ancient Greece. The game performed beautifully, with slight popping and pixelation every now and then, but rarely to the point of interrupting the actual gameplay.

I played Odyssey for a few hours in two separate locations and saw the same results: The game stopped once at each locale (my house and my dad’s), complete with a page saying I needed a stronger internet connection to continue.

Each time, Project Stream ran a connection check, and after a few minutes, everything was back up to par. I resumed my game from right where I’d left off (wildly flailing my sword at hordes of sandaled enemies) and didn’t experience any interruptions afterward. My internet connection was just strong enough to sustain Project Stream, and a small yellow icon at the bottom right of the screen reminded me that, because of this fact, the game could pause at any moment.

However, after those initial pauses, it didn’t. The actual game ran smoothly and only stopped when my connection became too precarious to continue, keeping the core experience completely intact. It never felt like Project Stream was impeding my gameplay in any way.

This is a remarkable achievement, especially considering how Sony’s streaming service, PlayStation Now, chugs on my home internet connection, making even a game like Lego Harry Potter unplayable. And that’s on the PS4, a console that’s built to run the latest and greatest AAA games around. With Project Stream, my internet connection was the problem, while the service itself ran Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in the Chrome browser of my MacBook Air with aplomb.



Google isn’t the only company making huge strides in video game streaming – Microsoft recently revealed Project xCloud, a service with a distinct emphasis on bringing AAA games to mobile devices.

“Ultimately, Project xCloud is about providing gamers – whether they prefer console or PC – new choices in when and where they play, while giving mobile-only players access to worlds, characters and immersive stories they haven’t been able to experience before,” Microsoft CVP of cloud gaming Kareem Choudhry explained in a blog post.

Microsoft says Project xCloud will theoretically work with every game from the Xbox One onward, bringing these experiences to laptops, outdated PCs, tablets and smartphones with ease. Streaming is a massive part of Microsoft’s plans for the next Xbox, with reports that the company is building two new consoles, one of which is designed specifically for streaming.



The backbone of Project xCloud is a series of high-powered, custom-built servers within the Azure network, and this infrastructure – combined with years of internal R&D – gives Microsoft an advantage in the streaming business, at least on paper. It plans to roll out a public beta for Project xCloud in 2019, while the new Xboxes are expected to land in 2020.

Meanwhile, Sony has been improving PlayStation Now on the consumer side, rolling out the option to download games and play them offline, which negates the low-quality streaming blues. With the next PlayStation console just around the corner, executives are surely deciding how much of a role streaming will play in the coming generation.

“If you look back at console gaming history, there are certain inflection points that allow for the industry to be upended and for new participants to emerge,” former Sony Interactive Entertainment chief Andrew House said in April. “One of those is when you have a wholesale shift in the distribution method. …So, other than the technical challenges, there’s no reason why game streaming can’t be present in games in the same way that we have seen in the music and film and television industries.”



Much like Netflix forever changed the way we consume TV and movies, Project Stream, Project xCloud or whatever Sony cooks up could be the catalyst that ushers the video game industry into a new era of play. However, game discs aren’t going anywhere just yet – it’ll likely take a handful of years and at least one more console generation before streaming surpasses local downloads as the norm.

There’s room for all of these services, and others, to succeed. When it comes to video game streaming, the near future finally looks bright.

My biggest interest in PSNow is Bloodborne. I don't think I'd be able to run it if it was an equivalent game made for PC(I can barely run DS3 with some heavy tweaking and it's still rather rough). I assume at least some aspect of my hardware has to matter to some degree, right? The data still has to be processed in some way, but which part matters? I've got a Phenom II x4 965, HD7770, 8 gigs ram. Also, side question... I've got an offbrand Playstation controller. Windows(7) is a bit wonky in the way it sets up some of the buttons/axes, but since I have to use x360ce anyway with almost every game I can just tweak things through there and it's fine.

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== sean9986 said: ↑ Is Sony basically releasing hardware in 3 year intervals now? If they release ps5 next year, 3 years after the pro and then a ps5 pro in 2022? Click to expand... That's sad.

The disc reader can read CDs and DVDs and software is the only thing that limits how those get interpreted. Again, the download from the store is just a digital version of the same game that was originally on a disc. I did look it up, and I found out that Sony has PSnow as a *paid* service to play older PlayStation games and after reading up on it, it’s clear to me what the problem is. Sony has decided that you should have to pay for older games AGAIN so they make more money, rather than letting you use your existing library. It’s by no means a hardware limitation. Purely a software limitation. Just as with a PS2 reading PS1 discs needs software to properly interpret it. Sony has put a form Digital Rights Management in place making it so that the PS4 won’t read the disc to play. Although, if you pay Sony for a new digital copy of the game, (which is the same data that the disc would have) it will work. There are videos where people have jail broken their PS4 to run older games, Essentially rewriting the code to allow them to run on the *existing* hardware. In short, the PS4 can play older games, but Sony locked the feature out so they can make more money.",,Honmeg,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Nothing at all. So, the PS3 has been broken, and you can work it like the PSP? Is it hard to pull off? The PS3s hard drive ain't that big. As long as you aren't on 4.83 firmware, which was literally just released, you'd have to have updated your PS3 within the last week. Anything below that can be manually updated to 4.82. Installing the CFW is easy, you put some files on a flash drive and go to a website on the PS3 browser and follow the directions. Spoofing for PSN access is maybe a bit more difficult just because you should read up extensively so you don't get banned. The most annoying thing I've heard is the USB ports can only read a FAT32 flash drive, which can only have files up to 4GB in size- i.e. you have to transfer disc games over FTP, or split files and then rejoin them on the console, or use an external NTFS hard drive and run a program when you start your PS3.

Games will be streamed to devices, and Microsoft has been testing the xCloud service with Xbox wireless controllers connected to consoles, mobile devices, and PCs. Microsoft says its research teams are ""creating ways to combat latency"" via advanced network techniques combined with video encoding and decoding. This should make game streaming viable on 4G networks, too. Public trials of the service will begin next year, and Microsoft's Xbox game streaming service will face competition from a variety of existing services. The most popular include GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Microsoft's xCloud unveiling comes just days after Google announced its own Project Stream service that will let testers play Assassin's Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

I like to think of it as like James Cameron being able to show people how awesome 3D movies can be...but unfortunately the glut of mediocre 3D conversion movies since have made people think 3D sucks/unnecessary. PsNow is the mediocre version of this tech, that is unfortunately causing corner gamers to shrug their shoulders at the idea) The latency and input lag is already down to the point where it doesn’t really matter. Microsoft will be offering a ~$100 box with their next gen stuff that has hardware in it to do half the work and make latency/input lag close to zero for those who really are sensitive to it. But honestly, gamers who game on consoles and hdtv’s have already conditioned themselves to put up with input lag (compared to pc/monitor gaming). It’s all relative. The majority of mainstream gamers will see streaming as the better option. Any drawbacks that core/hardcore see it streaming...really won’t matter. Streaming games at top of the line hardware quality on cheap old hardware is better than spending $400-$500 for less input lag...hardware that will eventually get old. With streaming, the games upgrade on the servers and you don’t have to upgrade hardware at home (or on the go) I mean, you tell the casual mainstream gamer all they have to do is pay $100 for the Xbox streaming box in order to play cyberpunk2077 at full ultra quality? As well as all other games? And never have to worry about upgrading? It will be the best option for most Click to expand... Link? Proof? Because I call bullshit on this generalization.

Wait...you are asking for proof that the majority of people in the world will overlook small amounts of input lag in their videogaming in order to play all games at modern visual quality on ubiquitous/cheap hardware? Is that what you are asking a source on? lol I mean, you just have to look at how casual/mainstream consumers consume to know this is true lol They will always choose convenience/cheaper for their media consumption even if it means not getting absolutely fidelity. This has always happened, this will always happen. As far as specifically to mainstream/casual gamers...we’ve seen them perfectly fine putting up with latency in online gaming, accepting sub native resolutions, perfectly fine with sub optimal and inconsistent frame rated, doesn’t really care about needing the best iq in their gaming etc...

The cloud server is talking to the game server, then the cloud server talks to you. It is another pipe for traffic to go through before it gets to you. Its fine for single player games that dont require any twitch movement.

I just don't see it happening that soon. Google may also be a big player next gen too, so I'm excited to see what they come up with. There is no doubt streaming services will play a bigger role in the coming years, but I wouldn't be super bullish about it just yet. I remember you were predicting a streaming capable Switch back in 2015 saying the tech was ready and imminent...and here we are 3 years later still talking about rumors and betas. I wouldn't be surprised if you are getting ahead of yourself like you did back then. I need to see how these ideas translate into consumer proposals first. Click to expand... I was right in 2015 about Switch being streaming capable...it has multiple games streaming to it from multiple publishers lol. It could have psnow running on it if Sony/Nintendo wanted. We aren’t taking about rumors and betas anymore. Psnow has been doing it. Nvidia has been doing it. Microsoft and Google are jumping all in now. This is what Microsoft is basing their next console around. No use pretending this is “some day” kind of thing anymore. Click to expand... No one is denying streaming is possible. Almost any hardware is ''streaming capable'' these days, considering the low requirements. However, you were talking about a more widely used, mass market feature of the Switch available from the get-go.

Microsoft is planning a streaming-only Xbox console, code-named Xbox Scarlett Cloud. Even the far less powerful hardware of the Nintendo Switch is getting…

It’s time for OITNB to say goodbye, advertisers claim Facebook lied about its video stats for over a year and we’re giving streaming games a try. Clearly, it’s Thursday morning.

Good to know.RED Hydrogen One graphic outlines the holographic phone’s specs



RED director Phil Holland published a “tech overview” infographic showing just what buyers of the company’s holographic phone will get. Some of them you may be very familiar with, such as the 5.7-inch “holographic” LCD, dual front and back cameras and the pogo pin connector for add-ons. Others may be relatively new to you, such as the 6GB of RAM, 4,500mAh battery and the “deep cavity” stereo speakers.

Enjoy ‘endless’ artist radio.Spotify Premium redesign borrows one of Pandora’s best features



Starting today, paying subscribers can enjoy streamlined navigation, personalized search and a feature called Endless Artist Radio. For that last one, just choose a favorite band or song, select the Artist Radio playlist and you’ll get an endless stream of music based on what you’ve chosen. Also, Spotify is ready for more wrists with a standalone Wear OS app that will launch in the next week.

Lies, damned lies and statistics.Facebook stands accused of lying to advertisers about video-view stats

Back in 2016, online marketing agency Crowd Siren sued the social network for inflating its metrics – now the company claims Facebook knew as early as 2015 that it was over-reporting figures.

 The social network had reported average viewing time of video ads – only counting views that lasted more than three seconds when it worked out “average duration of video viewed” – inflating the average length of a view. Facebook disclosed the issue in 2016, claiming it had “recently discovered” the error at the time. In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said, “suggestions that we in any way tried to hide this issue from our partners are false.”

Lock it down.Google details the Pixel 3’s Titan M security chip



The chip is tied into Android’s secure boot process and saves the last known-safe Android version to prevent attackers from rolling you back to an insecure firmware version. It also blocks attempts to unlock the bootloader from within Android, and no one can update your firmware unless you’ve entered your passcode. Also, apps that use Google’s StrongBox KeyStore framework can generate and store transaction keys in the secure hardware, and protected confirmation ensures that you’re the one who authorizes a payment.

Google’s Project Stream is a breath of fresh air.The next generation of streaming video games is on its way



Much like Netflix forever changed the way we consume TV and movies, Project Stream or Project xCloud could be the catalysts that usher the video-game industry into a new era of play. Thanks to Google’s game-streaming service, Jessica Conditt queued up Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on a 2015 Macbook Air and found that it worked smoothly, even though PlayStation Now frequently chugs on the same connection. The future is… now?

It may take a few days for Apple to prepare your info.Apple enables data downloads for US customers



Apple allowed its customers in the EU to download copies of the data the company held earlier this year, complying with General Data Protection Regulation rules. Now, Apple has updated its privacy website and is letting its customers in the US grab their data, too – it just may take a few days for Apple to prepare your info, but judging from our own investigations into GDPR and tech companies, Apple doesn’t hold all that much information on your digital life.

Most of them were cartoons from when I was really young (things like Tom & Jerry and Scooby Doo) and the rest were films. I had a lot of Jim Carrey's early comedies. Then I developed a bigger interest in films when I started recording them from the TV - everything from Terminator and the first Matrix film to Enemy Of The State and some of the classic Scorsese gangster films. I used to turn the machine on to record before I went to bed, then left it overnight until the tape ran out and I would rewind it the next day ready for the film to be watched at my convenience. When I got into Hindi films around 2004, I would wake up at 2 or 3am sometimes to press record on the machine because the films were on TV at stupid times, haha. Bear in mind this was before Netflix and Sky+ (so no recording from satellite TV!) and the choice of Hindi films and channels on Sky was a lot less varied than it is now. Nowadays I have easy access to films over the internet, so I've downloaded most of those films I once recorded, now in the best Bluray quality I can find. How times change! It's nice to reminisce about old technology though - also with remastered games available over XBox Live and PlayStation Now which bring back memories of my childhood.",,asif007,United Kingdom,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Not keen on me going to certain places, problem with me seeing certain friends. Not to the point he'd stop me but he let it be known he wasn't happy. At first I just reassured him and carried on but somehow overtime and without noticing, I've really cut myself off from people and barely go out without him anymore. When I'd suggest doing anything back then, he'd make a big deal about us spending time together and I was confused as we lived together so we naturally were together a lot. Now that I seem to have lost myself a bit, he could not be less interested. All he wants to do is play his PlayStation and when I mention going out now because I am bored of sitting upstairs alone (the game is downstairs in the living room) he suggests I come down and read my book. When I now complain about the fact we spend literally zero quality time together (he's on from the minute he gets home to the minute he goes to sleep) he tells me I'm being needy and weird. I realise some of the responsibly lies with myself here, I shouldn't have got myself in this position where I've lost the confidence to go out and see my friends to please him, but I honestly didn't notice it happening and now I am so shocked I've let it happen. So whilst I accept some of the blame, has his behaviour been acceptable here or what? I ask as I sit upstairs after another night alone listening to him downstairs speaking to his friends online on the PlayStation. ====================::==================== Now ignore him.

I was real skeptical before starting for the first time because a few years ago, I tried PSnow and I constantly had issues. Google really has their sh*t together. I cant believe how painless the whole experience has been. I've played it mostly on my gaming pc, but also used on a non gaming asus laptop from 2016 and on a HP laptop from 2012. The only time I noticed apparent drops in resolution was when using the 2012 laptop. I feel like it has to do with it only having 2.4ghz wifi and not 5ghz. While playing I never felt like I was losing anything as far as image quality from playing it streaming instead of on my gaming pc the conventional way. I'm sure my i7 7700k and gtx 1070 would have produced slightly better results, but I never think that while playing. I'm actually starting to prefer the Project Stream experience. I didn't have to wait for it to download. Everytime I want to play it starts up almost instantly. The load times are basically non existent....seems like your playing off of a ssd on crack! Also, I've only used an XB1 controller mostly with the windows 10 wireless adapter to play. Project Stream's system requirements state wired controllers only...no bluetooth. I've tested using bluetooth with my xb1 controller and it didn't pick it up in the game...so if you want wireless you need the adapter.",,reavis86,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Well, the company didn't actually call it PS5, but we all know that's what it's called. ""At this point, what I can say is it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware,"" said a guarded Kenichiro Yoshida, boss of Sony, in a new interview with the Financial Times . But what is PS5? According to the FT's sources, ""early indications were that it might not represent a major departure from the PS4, and that the fundamental architecture would be similar."" Whatever it is, Sony may not be in any huge rush to press the launch button on next-gen, what with the phenomenally successful PS4 still making billions for the company. Click to expand... Clearly, though, things are hotting up in the next-gen console area. At E3, Microsoft stepped out to say work had begun on ""the next Xbox consoles"". ""The same team that delivered unprecedented performance with Xbox One X is deep into architecting the next Xbox consoles, where we will once again deliver on our commitment to set the benchmark for console gaming,"" Xbox boss Phil Spencer said. Streaming will no doubt be a key offering with the next-gen consoles. Sony has tested the waters with its PlayStation Now subscription service. Yesterday, Microsoft announced a video game streaming offering of its own, called Project xCloud . Word on the street is Microsoft is planning a couple of different next-gen consoles, a more traditional console and a streaming-focused one. Could Sony follow suit with multiple types of PS5? E3 2019 looks a good bet for when we'll find out. Click to expand... https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/...-record-to-say-its-working-on-a-ps4-successor November 2020 seems most likely. Also, I wouldn't worry about FT report saying PS5 wouldn't represent a major departure from PS4, with the architecture being similar. The PS4 is x86 (Jaguar) the PS5 will no doubt also be x86 (Ryzen / Zen, probably 7nm Zen 2). As long has PS5 has backwards compatibility and a worthy increase in computing performance and memory (GDDR6 instead of GDDR5), there's every reason to believe PS5 will be based on solid hardware. It's pricing that really matters, after games. ====================::==================== Is Sony basically releasing hardware in 3 year intervals now? If they release ps5 next year, 3 years after the pro and then a ps5 pro in 2022?",,sean9986,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sony finally goes on the record to say it's working on a PS4 successor,,,

If it doesn't have full proper BC (physical/digital and maybe even multi-gen support), then I don't want to hear any of the spin they are planning. And don't blabber at me about PSNow. I have not, do not and will not bother with that service, ever.

I was asking about the PS3, but I wanna know about them ALL, baby. OK, the ones I know of that are working 100 percent are Phoebe/Rhea for the Saturn (got these) USB-GDROM and the GDEMU for the Dreamcast (have the USB) 3DO Renovation is supposed to be good. Don't have one, as I have ZERO interest in this system. OK, then we get into the ""I dunno for sure"" about these. PSIO for the Playstation: Now, I heard about this WAY back, but the creators had a falling out...I don't even know. I've heard mixed things on it, but people complain about the software. What's the skinny? Anyone have one? PS3 Cobra: See Below I know the Phoebe guy is working on one for the PCE CD, but I honestly don't know if he's ever going to finish it. Are there any for the Gamecube? I know there aren't any for the Sega CD yet (so, I think). I love these things, with a passion. So, any being worked on? Any exciting news? I was hoping someone would come up with one for the PS2. I run games off the HDD, but it's not 100 percent. I'd prefer something better. ====================::==================== The maker of the GDEMU and Rhea/Phoebe is also manufacturing an ODE for the FM Towns Marty. He's also considering one for the grey tower FM Towns as well, and there's been talk of one for the Sega CD. PC Engine/TurboGrafx has the Super SD System 3 , which both provides RGB output and simulates the CD addon like an ODE would. As for the PSIO, it's not a drop-in replacement for the optical drive like the GDEMU. It was designed to live side-by-side with the existing optical drive, so you can boot from the disc, from the SD card, or from a PC via USB. An unfortunate side effect is that the installation is difficult and destructive; not only do you have to solder a bunch of wires to the underside of the motherboard, you also need to cut one or more fine traces. Personally, I wish the PSIO was more like the GDEMU and was stupidly simple to install, or perhaps only required soldering one or two wires and was thus non-destructive and reversible. I've not heard much regarding the quality of the software.",,nmalinoski,United Kingdom,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,The ODE thread,,,
