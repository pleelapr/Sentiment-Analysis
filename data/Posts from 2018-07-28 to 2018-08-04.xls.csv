Yeah, Sony demands a fee for over 400 more games for their rental service than MS rental service, totally unfair! No, that isn't a fact because entertainment is subjective to the individual looking to be entertained. I have had PSNow. It doesn't have ES Morrowind, and Halo games so for my entertainment its lineup is lacking. I don't like being tied up. Some men do by women they PAY MONEY to and call Mistress. Is my sexual entertainment far superior to theirs? So many people cannot grasp that in entertainment there truthfully is no ""best"" or ""superior"". It all comes down to the wants of the individual seeking to be entetertained. I didn't bring up PSNow as a slight against Sony. I was actually suggesting PSNow is still going because some people are obviously paying to stream old games. So old games must make a number of people happy. But this is SW and you always have your guard up. My only point was that it's not simply, ""old games"" as you put it, but it's OVER 600 GAMES available at one time. That puts things into perspective a bit better as people aren't simply going crazy for old games, but with the selection that PSNow offers it becomes quite attractive to any gamer who has a stable connection even today for the annual asking price (the only selection I would ever consider If I ever decided to try it). You can't just dissect what PSNow offers and trivialize why some might be paying for that service by trying to pick and choose what you want to highlight for your argument. Yes, most of PSNow selection is old games...(like Games Pass) but it's selection is by far the most comprehensive among the big 3 for the price point, so of course people would sub just because it's a good deal for the money looking at the games they can access. LOL No I really can because entertainment is completely subjective. There is no all powerful Gaming God that states what is factually best. It cannot be proven to be fact. Popular opinion doesn't equal fact and that is the most humans can do in terms of entertainment. 600 games that run at 720p and with some lag. I had it for 3 months, a person from this forum remembers seeing me play it. So you may value the 600 games, but others value downloading games or plain owning them like X1 BC offers all without lag. I know what is best for me and I don't go around trying to state what is best for humans overall.",,cainetao11,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I would say mostly yes, games are cheap and the library is huge. However I have data-caps which made streaming PS3 games on PSNow impractical, so I don't know how much that would play into your decision-making. Also if I can be a bit cheeky, I think the PS3 was an exclusives golden age for Sony, lots of HD Collections and sequels. The PS4 has largely failed to replicate it, with exclusives mostly being one-offs, flops, or bookeends to PS3 series.",,TranquiloRush,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The article states people have collectively used it for 1 billion hours. Do you want them to further break it down to be X number of users have used it a minimum of X hours? Yes, because you're trying to equate the hours evenly across everyone, and that's ridiculous for the same reasons I pointed out with PSNow. So your argument in support of its popularity is that an even smaller percentage of the player base than half actually like BC after trying it? Except it's not a small percentage. Again, buy your logic, PSNow should not exist since most people don't use it. And it's not my fault MS won't post their sales #'s anymore because they are too embarrassed. It IS your fault that you are making up numbers just to defend Sony's anti-consumer practices however. It's amazingly telling that you, a consumer, are defending anti-consumer practices just to root for a company that could not care less about you. It's mentality like THAT which results in a worse experience for everyone. Oh and btw, I'm in support of BC. Just because I'm being realistic and I think critically about some arbitrary stats doesn't mean I'm against the feature. Except that you are defending the lack of it, and we all know the reason Sony isn't doing it is because they basically have no competition this gen, you are defending anti-consumer monopolistic practices. Maybe stop being so defensive whenever anyone tries to defame your precious MS. Precious MS? Is that why I don't have an Xbox One? I am merely mentioning how MS is being far more consumer-friendly this gen than Sony is, yet people attack MS and defend Sony just to fanboy over their favorite company.",,Cyber Akuma Zero,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

PSP Go was an all digital handheld console that released 10 years ago. Steam launched 15 years ago. Also, moving goalposts, first you argued that the entire PSP product line was not doing well, not you are trying to argue that the Go was just ""ahead of it's time"" Physical media is the same thing for the PS4 as well. WRONG - You do not need to register a PS4 disk game to use it - You do not need approval to sell it used... if the publisher even lets you - There is no limit to how many times you can buy/sell used - The disk does not get tied to your console when you install it - You can still find delisted games physical because of the secondhand market NONE of these apply to digital, don't even try to argue that physical is just the same as digital merely because you need to install it. Even the freaking PS2 had games with an install option if you had a HDD on your system. Well, they do mostly care about money, but in the future money, by I which I mean the highest profitability will be in digital. In other words, they are only doing it for money. If it wasn't a more profitable method, they woudl not give a damn if it was newer or ""the future"". And the profitability comes at the expensive of the consumer and employing anti-consumer tactics, THIS is why they want digital, it has ZERO to do with it being ""the future"". If they could somehow make more money by just releasing the game on Vinyl record over digital, they would. I'm not for streaming either, but my point was that execs are looking for ways to cut loss by getting rid of physical media. And my point is it's literally not possible. Case in point: PSNow has some pretty crummy input lag and I can't game that way. OnLives was even worse. And again, this is a limit of the very laws of physics. The speed of light is roughly 670,616,629 mph, which of course is stupidly fast.... but that still means it would take about 140-150ms give or take for it to travel around the world... and that's JUST counting the bare signal itself, not all the routing and networking hopping it would have to do that would SIGNIFICANTLY add several times more latency. It's not a problem that will be fixed in the future just by better tech, not unless you break the laws of physics.",,Cyber Akuma Zero,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Your average gamer isn't going to buy it, they'll buy the proper console. The masses don't jump on new technologies straight away, still buy physical games, and I don't think will be receptive to the idea of streaming games by default, and that's assuming the price is cheap enough to put it in their market However, I also doubt Microsoft are banking big on this. I suspect the service rather than the box is important to them, the box could die on its arse, but if people take up the subscription on their proper Xbox Microsoft will be delighted imo And again you are not pointing out any negatives. This is obviously for those who want a cheap console and/or an experience that they can play on a underpowered device. It's like asking why is Fornite on Mobile, or why is PlayStation Now on the PC. If you don't like to play on mobile then it's not for you is it but if Microsoft can give a console and PC level of detail on a underpowered device for cheaper than it would be to buy an Xbox or a comparable PC then that's great, just as long as they also have a box that doesn't stream which we are already play games like now.

PSOne and PSP games should be pretty easy to port/emulate on PS4, and allowing access to them should be a technologically easy task, though I can understand if the bureaucracy of it all is far more trouble than its worth, especially with the questionable interest in said games and market for them. 2) In this day and age of digital distribution, Sony managed to make it more convenient for their console owners to pirate and/or emulate older games than to acquire and play them legally from the PSN store.",,zxxcman,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

LOL Its this mindset that will prevent this medium from being considered a truthful art form. Nobody says ""do you really watch old movies like Streetcar Named Desire?"" Their age doesn't make them any less fun to play. Sony simply demands a streaming fee for it. And PSNow wouldn't exist by now if some people weren't paying for it. I'm playing Maximo and the Army of Zin from the PS2 now. To sum up, yes old games still make me happy. They don't have expiration dates. I don't subscribe to PSNow but it's selection of games if far superior to that of the selection that one can boast for Xbox one BC, vastly so. PSNow is in fact has a far superior library to choose from than Games Pass as well. Just for clarification purposes, the air need to be clear that PSNow isn't some limited service with only a few old titles, it has a selection of games that's over 600 titles at one time! Also there is a year sub now available for $99.99 for PSNow, this is actually $20 cheaper than MS's Games pass for a year which offer 400 LESS games to play (Games Pass having less than 200 games)so.. Yeah, Sony demands a fee for over 400 more games for their rental service than MS rental service, totally unfair! No, that isn't a fact because entertainment is subjective to the individual looking to be entertained. I have had PSNow. It doesn't have ES Morrowind, and Halo games so for my entertainment its lineup is lacking. I don't like being tied up. Some men do by women they PAY MONEY to and call Mistress. Is my sexual entertainment far superior to theirs? So many people cannot grasp that in entertainment there truthfully is no ""best"" or ""superior"". It all comes down to the wants of the individual seeking to be entetertained. I didn't bring up PSNow as a slight against Sony. I was actually suggesting PSNow is still going because some people are obviously paying to stream old games. So old games must make a number of people happy.

Which is the better of the two? @Epikmonkey Its not about which is better. The series is connected through a chronological story that is set against real time. (aside from Zero which was a prequel set in 1988 where Kiryu was 20 yrs old). Every Yakuza game starting from the first as set in the year the game came out. The characters Kiryu Kazama and his adopted daughter Haruka, grow up in front of you throughout the series. Haruka starts off as 9yrs old in Yakuza Kiwami 1 (which is a remake of Yakuza 1 PS2 which came out and was set in the year 2005), and by Yakuza 6, which came out and was set in the year 2016, she is a 20 year old adult with her own child, which btw was also Kiryu's sendoff title of which he is 48 years old now. so get them in this order (forget the people who say go and buy Yakuza 1 on PS2 they are talking nonsense): Yakuza Zero followed by Yakuza Kiwami followed by Yakuza Kiwami 2 followed by Yakuza 3 HD (when it gets localized. Asian version drops this month). Or play it on PS3 (physical only). followed by Yakuza 4 HD (when it gets localized. or play it on PS4 through PSNow) or play it on PS3 digital or Physical followed by Yakuza 5 HD (when it gets localized. or play it on PS4 through PSNow) or play it on PS3 (digital only) followed by Yakuza 6 on PS4 then wait for Yakuza 7, which will star a whole new lead character named Ichiban...who kinda looks like a cross between Al Pachino, Spike from Cowboy Bebop and Mr Satan only anorexic....and in the meantime, play Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise, which is made by the Yakuza dev team.",,Gatchan2,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

There is much more to fios then just the upload and download speeds, the fiber wire plus their setup is much better then copper and cable. -No bandwidth loss when others on in you neighborhood. -Faster speed (not bandwidth) -Less interference -Signal can travel over longer distances without loss (meaning you won't need to worry about stuff like those signal boosters) -Usually around the same price as cable I'm not sure, I could also be forgetting stuff. Oh it's not a trade from fiber to non-fiber. A few months ago AT&T got fiber in my area and we switched to it after like 20 years of Comcast. Then just recently, Comcast got fiber here as well, and my dad wanted to try it because he prefers Comcast TV service (so that he can utilize the TiVo systems he's purchased over time). When testing the speeds though, AT&T had slightly better ping, and upload speeds as high as 950mbps, where comcast only had 35-42mbps upload anywhere (throttling I guess for whatever reason). Comcast's connection did also drop briefly during testing, which used to happen all the time back when we had their regular internet service. Haven't noticed any drops at all in the months I've had AT&T though, oddly enough. So yeah, was about fiber to fiber, where one uploads faster. There is also that one connection drop to consider though.. Oh ok, that's not too bad then. The only things I would be careful about are game streaming services like PSNow, I'm not sure exactly how heavy they are on the upload side, and how many people you have connected at once. You may be able to get away with it. I still stick with the lowest fios option available in my area which is 75/75, cause it's good enough.",,Mozzezz,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Also the specs/resolution do not enter this, I am only playing at 1080p. So I am looking at the PS4 Pro with the ideal use of PSN which I believe is has similar functionality to Xbox game pass (certain games downloaded via subscription) and was wondering if this is first worth it? as this will be a primary method of playing games. Secondly I want to play older games like PS1/2/3 similar to how Xbox backwards compatability works, and is the game library as good as xbox ones? What other differences are there between the PS4 Pro and Xbox, again specs do not enter this I am looking at pure gaming. Many Thanks ====================::==================== Xbox: Forza series, Gears of War Series, Halo series etc.. It has backward compatibility but since it's emulation it doesn't support every game, but it does continue to grow. Check this list and see if you see anything you like: https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-27-xbox-one-backwards-compatibility-list-xbox-360-games Game pass list: https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-08-01-xbox-game-pass-games-list-price Note that with game pass, it's like netflix, games will come and go each month but Xbox promises to bring out new games onto their game pass on release (like Forza Horizon 4, Crackdown 3, Gears of War 5 etc..) Xbox Play Anywhere: These titles will play on your xbox or your PC, they're crossplay as well. For example, me, the wife and 2 online buddies play Horde mode together on Gears of War 4 once in a while. 3 of them play on Xbox, I play it on PC. More games are supporting Xbox Play Anywhere, so if you already have a decent gaming pc, you might want to consider playing these on PC instead. I've currently been jumping between playing Forza Horizon 3 on my Xbox One and PC depending if I'm playing in the living room, or downstairs on my PC. Ps4: Exclusives like: Horizon Zero Dawn, Uncharted, God of War, Last of US etc... For classic games you can stream them through playstation now subscription service or you'll have to use the classic consoles. Keep in mind PS4 has a bunch of classic titles as HD re-releases. Boost mode: Don't Quote: me on this but I think the ps4 pro will give a slight boost even to non ps4 pro enabled titles.",,Majinhoju,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Looking at purchasing a PS4 Pro over Xbox One X - Console Gaming,,,

In essence, it's just an emulated port. Would you call paying for PSNow ""BC""? Or how about buying Virtual Console games... are those ""BC""? Making money on those old Xbox games wasn't because of ""BC."" It was because they were offered digitally for sale. Just because you can buy them digitally doesn’t make it less bc, you could buy 360 games digitally and you are playing them digitally still.

But modern PCs tend to have trouble with running old games, let alone running them out of the box, unless it comes from a service like gog that fixes them. Many of them do have documented ways to get them to work better on modern PCs, but it is only slightly better than the selective backwards compatibility of PS4 or Xbox One. PC gaming has come a long way since the late 80s/early 90s. Back then, you could spend thousands on a computer whose games sometimes didn't look, sound, or play as well as the games on a $200 console. Ports like Mega Man and TMNT were atrocious on PC. Nowadays there they don't cost much more than a console and are superior in most ways. ====================::==================== @ReaderRagfish I've mentioned that a bit earlier in my earlier post where Sony and Microsoft offered their own backwards compatibility, but it's either limited right now (Microsoft and some of PS1 classics on PS4), just extremely bad like PSNow, or flat-out doesn't exist like the Switch.

Somehow Gamestop Sweden promised me three years warranty (?!) on this thing. 500 gig drive already starting looking small. 500 is pretty decent for a PS3. They technically support up to 1.5 tb (if you put in a larger drive it'll work but not actually see more than 1.5tb of it) but the ""backup"" function of the system stops working if you have more than 640 gigs of data actually installed. You mainly want to focus on the games that are notoriously lengthy to download/install, which is roughly the following list, especially if you own these games digitally: Destiny (also on PS4. PS3 version has like an 8 gig patch, and I think also an in-game patch) God of War: Ascension (on PSNow), it's like 36 gigs so you need 80 gigs free for the digital version. The disc version is fine, though, I don't think there's an install or even a patch. Gran Turismo 5 (only available on disc, has an in-game patch) Gran Turismo 6, has an in-game patch and oh boy does it take a while The Last of Us (also on PS4), digital version downloads through a weird UI downloader that you have to babysit so your PS3 doesn't shut itself down since it doesn't follow the normal PS3 OS rules and thinks it's a game you left unattended. There are a bunch of games where the digital versions are like 18ish gigs and somewhat painful to install but less bad than the above. I think Destiny is the only disc game which won't work on those 12 gig units; GT6 should be OK if you don't patch it.",,univbee,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

You do realize God of War is a first party title so that 30% doesn't apply to it right? God of War has sold nearly 10 million copy's, Its doing just fine. Sony isn't going to put system sellers on PSNow because they are making more money on them being system sellers. Also notice how the only sells God of War has had was in store sells done by company's like Gamestop? That's because its still selling. Relax there buddy, let me explain. You're right about God of War, but keep in mind that first party titles are mainly used to get people to buy the machine. As successful as God of War is on the PS4, you'd make 2x as much if the game was ported to PC and Xbox. By putting the game on the PSNow service, Sony can keep the platform exclusives while servicing PC and Xbox users. And if PC and Xbox users don't want to deal with washed out image quality and latency, they can always get a PS4. That would be the other incentive for Sony to put GoW on PSNow. The PS4 has outsold the PS3 and God of War has sold nearly 10 million copy's. At this point Sony doesn't really care if a handful of PC,Switch,XB1 users don't have a PS4 yet. We are reaching the end of the PS4's life cycle. I'm sure Sony cares cause while the PS4 is the most popular console, it isn't dominating the market as much as you'd think. Sony could face the same problems as Nintendo cause their first party titles are great, but limited to their hardware. So obviously you provoke people to make emulators. Someone might have a working PS4 emulator, and they choose not to release it in fear of Sony's legal team. This is what happened with UltraHLE which had been working for a while, and the author reluctantly released it. Especially with the way the economy is today, people can't afford to pay for two or three consoles to play a select few games. I'm surprised that the PS4 and Xbox One are both $300. I would have thought by now the machines are like $200 or $250. A price drop of the PS4 and a bundle of GoW would drive more sales for Sony, which is what I expect around Christmas this year. But Sony is kinda full of themselves lately.",,Guardian Bob,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,,,,

Netlfix started streaming 2 years prior as well. Digital media was in its infancy at that time and the PSP Go was ahead of its time. -Physical media is the same thing for the PS4 as well. Every single game installs on the hard drive from the disc. XBO failed because it did not allow used games and consumers would lose out on savings. They also didn't like having to check their console in once a day in order to play. https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4445984/xbox-one-policy-reversal-changes Microsoft is making a major U-turn today by reversing some of its controversial Xbox One policies. In a statement on the company's Xbox blog, Microsoft says it's making policy changes ""as a result of feedback from the Xbox community."" Microsoft is reversing a 24-hour online check, noting that it will not be required to play offline Xbox One games. ""After a one-time system set-up with a new Xbox One, you can play any disc-based game without ever connecting online again,"" says a Microsoft statement. Microsoft is also reversing its used game policy, noting there will be no limitations to using and sharing games. ""It will work just as it does today on Xbox 360."" Microsoft previously revealed it would support installing games to HDD from disc, without a requirement for the disc, but the changes mean that the disc will now be required to be in the tray for the game to work. ""Downloaded titles cannot be shared or resold,"" says Microsoft, which means a 10-person family sharing feature has been killed off. Regional restrictions are also being removed, allowing consumers to buy a disc from a retailer and play it on any Xbox One console. The U-turn is a significant change in policy for Microsoft, and it follows initial confusion over its policies and the restrictions gaining mainstream attention this week. Microsoft is clearly reacting to Sony's own E3 announcements, hoping to repair some of the damage over the confusing and controversial aspects to its next-generation console. -Well, they do mostly care about money, but in the future money, by I which I mean the highest profitability will be in digital. -I'm not for streaming either, but my point was that execs are looking for ways to cut loss by getting rid of physical media. That's the long term plan and it will start with games and eventually the consoles when the tech is ready. -I do remember OnLive.

Also this is my girlfriend's account because I can't remember my login. I never thought purgatory would be like this. As I looked over the... Machine? Wall slot? I noticed a small display. It read ""LIVE ANOTHER DAY: 1$"". Well, I'm obviously dead, so mission accomplished. However, whatever this magical, cash4life thing is, it's giving me a shot at more than I would've had otherwise. After taking a deep breath, I thought for a moment. How did I die? Well, I took my own life. But I'm assuming whatever this machine does probably takes me back to shortly before that event, which would be fine and i'd have nothing to explain at a hospital. I'm thinking about accepting or declining the offer when a screen appears beside the slot. It starts showing me graphic scenes of my loved ones mourning, lives changing, people moving on. But it didn't sit well with me. The image of my mother's face covered in heartbreak I couldn't bear to look at. ""Is this really it?"" I thought to myself. I couldn't let that become a reality. ""Well alright, that seems fair, a dollar a day. Not too bad I can manage that. Just have to get rid of the PSNow and my netflix subscription but i'll manage."" So I put my dollar into the slot. And the very next second i'm right where I was before I made the decision to commit suicide. So I unload my gun, and put it away. The next thing I do is call my mom. I just have a normal conversation with her, tell her I love her then hop off the phone. At this point, i'm happy to be alive but i'm still depressed. I can't shake the images I saw on that display. The rest of the day plays out uneventful. I smoke some bud, play some Hearthstone and pass out. Then i'm faced with the same scene as before. The wall slot. Except this time the display read ""LIVE ANOTHER DAY: 2$"". Shit. ""This isn't good. My days are numbered. This is just like the fatigue mechanic in Hearthstone, I guess god likes his card games."" I pondered what this could mean. ""No way will I allow all my money to be drained out of me so there's nothing left to leave to my wife and our son. Maybe i'm looking too much into it but if I want to escape this circle I need a plan, no guarantee this could work, but I have to go with what I know."" So I put my 2$ into the slot and wake up the following morning. I eat a good breakfast and start working on a plan. If this truly is like Hearthstone in that, for example, in other card games like Magic: The Gathering, if you draw from an empty deck you lose the game. But in Hearthstone, once you run out of cards you take 1 damage when you draw from it, then 2 damage, then 3 and so on. Much like this purgatory life-machine. So I just need to add more cards to my deck. Right. But how do I do that? I'm not sure but I don't have that much money to spend for the time to find out. I need to find a solution if I can, and fast. I rack my brain and spend almost 500$ just to live for the next month or so. I can't keep this up, i'm lying to my girl about what i'm spending my money on, i'm stressed, sleeping less, tired all the time, I've made no progress in stopping this vicious cycle I find myself trapped in. I've tried making plans in advance, things I have to attend, that didn't work. I sold my gun to someone, that didn't work. I tried staying up all night, that didn't work I only ended up seeing it at 12:00 midnight anyway. Only thing now is to resign myself to the fate I set for myself when I pulled that trigger. That night, after spending the last 31$ I have to wake up the next morning. I just plan on spending some time with the people I love and making sure they all know how much I love them. Might as well go out on a good note than no note at all like the last time. I wake up about 8:30, kiss my wife and we get up and head to my mom's house. We spend some quality time together for the majority of the day. The 4 of us laughed, we cried, and most importantly, we had a great time. I didn't think about the impending doom. I just wanted to enjoy life while I had it. So we say our goodbyes, and head home. My wife and I watch a movie, make love and before we know it, it's 10:00. She goes to sleep for work the following morning and I make my way to the bedroom after her, but I can't sleep. I lay there for about an hour and a half before I move back to the living room. I started crying. ""I don't want to die. I love my life. I love my Son, my wife, my mom, my dad, my friends. I love my life. I don't want to leave my son without his father, I don't want to hurt my mother, I don't want to leave my wife a widow. I DON'T WANT TO DIE!"" As the panic set in, the clock struck 12:00. I had no money left in my bank account and judgement was nigh. I closed my eyes and waited for death's permanent grasp. I opened my eyes but the scene I was faced with was not that of the slot, but a button, placed atop a pedestal. With tears streaming down my face, I made my way towards it. The button is... White? I would have guessed red. There was nothing extravagant about it, no text other than ""PRESS HERE"". After letting a few more tears fall, I whisper I love yous to my family, closed my eyes, and pressed the button. I felt my consciousness fade, and felt a horrible pain in my chest. I awoke to the sight of a hospital with my wife, holding me in her arms as she cried with our son and my parents beside her. She asks me what I remember as I've been out could for a couple of days. I'm speechless so she tells me that I shot myself in the chest, I lost a lot of blood but the bullet missed everything important and i'm lucky to be alive. She was right. I am lucky to be alive, and I couldn't be happier. ***THE END***",,Kittycat0922,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

To them it doesn't matter what digital dales are for mobile gaming, they only care about their games, and the money it brings in. This You think any of them give a crap about what is ""the future""? They only want digital because it basically gives them a monopoly on sales AND lets them control your access to your games even after they sell them to you, that's making them drool dollar signs. Look at how well the PSP Go and original Xbox One plans turned out when they actually attempted it though... Also: ""Paperless offices are the future"" - Xerox, 1970s. Guess what? The vast majority of offices still use hundreds to thousands of sheets of paper a day. PSP Go was a late iteration of a dying, poorly performing console. The idea was a little ahead of its time, too. Xbox One? That was never designed to be all digital. It failed out of the gates because of their stance on used games. These guys definitely care about the future and one of the best ways to save money is to eliminate physical game production. I think we mentioned it ITT too, that they want to ditch physical so badly that they're already talking about getting rid of consoles and turning their brands into streaming services. Sony is getting ready with PSNow. It's nowhere near ready yet imo, but it's close. One of the biggest, if not the biggest costs/losses Sony/MS/Nintendo encounter are from making physical consoles. They almost always take a loss on them with the idea they'll make money back with game sales and online services. Regarding Xerox lol, I guess just because this is a fun debate, offices still have a use for paper. Although I'm willing to bet there's a major decrease in paper consumption in the modern world compared to the 70s. I don't think it will be possible to get the actual stats though.",,HappyGuy,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

The whole point is to get game developers to make games for your platform. A platform that you make 30% off all game sales. I wouldn't be shocked if God of War does end up on PSNow, just because there's a lot of hungry PC/Xbox/Nintendo owners who want to play the game, but don't want to buy the console. What in the fuck are you talking about? You do realize God of War is a first party title so that 30% doesn't apply to it right? God of War has sold nearly 10 million copy's, Its doing just fine. Sony isn't going to put system sellers on PSNow because they are making more money on them being system sellers. Also notice how the only sells God of War has had was in store sells done by company's like Gamestop? That's because its still selling. The PS4 has outsold the PS3 and God of War has sold nearly 10 million copy's. At this point Sony doesn't really care if a handful of PC,Switch,XB1 users don't have a PS4 yet.

Today marks the day that Xbox One users have finally gotten backwards compatibility for TWO Splinter Cell titles (Blacklist and Double Agent). I am a HUGE fan of the entire Splinter Cell series and own a PS4 and to this day I have yet to see a single Splinter Cell entry on Playstation's PSNow service, not a SINGLE TITLE. I realize a remaster would be too much to ask for (as would be a new title), but why can I not in 2018 play a single old Splinter Cell title on the PSNow service?! I have been waiting far too long for this to happen, Ubisoft is essentially catering only to Xbox users at this point and completely losing out on at least half of the potential sales that could be accumulated by offering the same to PlayStation users as they've just done for Xbox users. It's a shame and it saddens me and I hope to rally a few people together and make this happen one day.

The article states people have collectively used it for 1 billion hours. Do you want them to further break it down to be X number of users have used it a minimum of X hours? Yes, because you're trying to equate the hours evenly across everyone, and that's ridiculous for the same reasons I pointed out with PSNow. So your argument in support of its popularity is that an even smaller percentage of the player base than half actually like BC after trying it? Except it's not a small percentage. Again, buy your logic, PSNow should not exist since most people don't use it. And it's not my fault MS won't post their sales #'s anymore because they are too embarrassed. It IS your fault that you are making up numbers just to defend Sony's anti-consumer practices however. It's amazingly telling that you, a consumer, are defending anti-consumer practices just to root for a company that could not care less about you. It's mentality like THAT which results in a worse experience for everyone. Oh and btw, I'm in support of BC. Just because I'm being realistic and I think critically about some arbitrary stats doesn't mean I'm against the feature. Except that you are defending the lack of it, and we all know the reason Sony isn't doing it is because they basically have no competition this gen, you are defending anti-consumer monopolistic practices. Maybe stop being so defensive whenever anyone tries to defame your precious MS. Precious MS? Is that why I don't have an Xbox One? I am merely mentioning how MS is being far more consumer-friendly this gen than Sony is, yet people attack MS and defend Sony just to fanboy over their favorite company. I'm equating it across everyone because that's a means to put the 1 billion hours into perspective. Unless you have some better stats to utilize, that's the best we can quantitatively do. You say it's not a small percentage, but you don't know any better than I do how many users are actually using it on a high level. And you keep bringing up PSNow but I never mentioned it. I'm not even a fan of PSNow. Show me some stats about PSNow and I'll comment on them if you like, but otherwise it's irrelevant. You seem to have blinded yourself with some misguided sense that I'm defending Sony's lack of BC. Show me where I've said that, because I surely haven't. You're just putting words in my mouth now. Again, all I'm doing is questioning MS's claim that BC is immensely popular because ""1 billion hours"". That does not equate to me supporting Sony's position on it. If all you're trying to do is say ""MS is being better than Sony about BC"" then you're going about it an odd way is all. Someone questions the validity of some stat they spout and you go into some tirade to vehemently defend it.",,markd23,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Oh hang on, you can't authenticate your account due to lack of servers.

The psn servers aren't down, and they haven't even stated they plan on shutting them down yet and were about to be 2 gens past the ps3's birth. We're talking possibly 20-30 years in the future. For nearly 99% of the population, many will have moved on. That's just reality, and the sacrifice we as a society have made in order to progress science and technology into the future.

PSNow is in fact has a far superior library to choose from than Games Pass as well. Just for clarification purposes, the air need to be clear that PSNow isn't some limited service with only a few old titles, it has a selection of games that's over 600 titles at one time! Also there is a year sub now available for $99.99 for PSNow, this is actually $20 cheaper than MS's Games pass for a year which offer 400 LESS games to play (Games Pass having less than 200 games)so.. Yeah, Sony demands a fee for over 400 more games for their rental service than MS rental service, totally unfair! No, that isn't a fact because entertainment is subjective to the individual looking to be entertained. I have had PSNow. It doesn't have ES Morrowind, and Halo games so for my entertainment its lineup is lacking. I don't like being tied up. Some men do by women they PAY MONEY to and call Mistress. Is my sexual entertainment far superior to theirs? So many people cannot grasp that in entertainment there truthfully is no ""best"" or ""superior"". It all comes down to the wants of the individual seeking to be entetertained. I didn't bring up PSNow as a slight against Sony. I was actually suggesting PSNow is still going because some people are obviously paying to stream old games. So old games must make a number of people happy. But this is SW and you always have your guard up. My only point was that it's not simply, ""old games"" as you put it, but it's OVER 600 GAMES available at one time. That puts things into perspective a bit better as people aren't simply going crazy for old games, but with the selection that PSNow offers it becomes quite attractive to any gamer who has a stable connection even today for the annual asking price (the only selection I would ever consider If I ever decided to try it). You can't just dissect what PSNow offers and trivialize why some might be paying for that service by trying to pick and choose what you want to highlight for your argument. Yes, most of PSNow selection is old games...(like Games Pass) but it's selection is by far the most comprehensive among the big 3 for the price point, so of course people would sub just because it's a good deal for the money looking at the games they can access.",,tgob89,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Also the specs/resolution do not enter this, I am only playing at 1080p. So I am looking at the PS4 Pro with the ideal use of PSN which I believe is has similar functionality to Xbox game pass (certain games downloaded via subscription) and was wondering if this is first worth it? as this will be a primary method of playing games. Secondly I want to play older games like PS1/2/3 similar to how Xbox backwards compatability works, and is the game library as good as xbox ones? What other differences are there between the PS4 Pro and Xbox, again specs do not enter this I am looking at pure gaming. Many Thanks ====================::==================== Xbox: Forza series, Gears of War Series, Halo series etc.. It has backward compatibility but since it's emulation it doesn't support every game, but it does continue to grow. Check this list and see if you see anything you like: https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-27-xbox-one-backwards-compatibility-list-xbox-360-games Game pass list: https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-08-01-xbox-game-pass-games-list-price Note that with game pass, it's like netflix, games will come and go each month but Xbox promises to bring out new games onto their game pass on release (like Forza Horizon 4, Crackdown 3, Gears of War 5 etc..) Xbox Play Anywhere: These titles will play on your xbox or your PC, they're crossplay as well. For example, me, the wife and 2 online buddies play Horde mode together on Gears of War 4 once in a while. 3 of them play on Xbox, I play it on PC. More games are supporting Xbox Play Anywhere, so if you already have a decent gaming pc, you might want to consider playing these on PC instead. I've currently been jumping between playing Forza Horizon 3 on my Xbox One and PC depending if I'm playing in the living room, or downstairs on my PC. Ps4: Exclusives like: Horizon Zero Dawn, Uncharted, God of War, Last of US etc... For classic games you can stream them through playstation now subscription service or you'll have to use the classic consoles. Keep in mind PS4 has a bunch of classic titles as HD re-releases.

Physical games will never go away, just like dvd's arent going away for movies. But the primary method of consumption for movies and TV is digital, and games are going that way too. And Microsoft seems to understand that and is currently implementing it in a much more consumer-friendly way that is also still true to the games themselves, as opposed to the limitations imposed by game streaming like the psnow",,Mr_The_Captain,United States of America,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Reddit,,,,,,,,

PSP Go was an all digital handheld console that released 10 years ago. Steam launched 15 years ago. Also, moving goalposts, first you argued that the entire PSP product line was not doing well, not you are trying to argue that the Go was just ""ahead of it's time"" Physical media is the same thing for the PS4 as well. WRONG - You do not need to register a PS4 disk game to use it - You do not need approval to sell it used... if the publisher even lets you - There is no limit to how many times you can buy/sell used - The disk does not get tied to your console when you install it - You can still find delisted games physical because of the secondhand market NONE of these apply to digital, don't even try to argue that physical is just the same as digital merely because you need to install it. Even the freaking PS2 had games with an install option if you had a HDD on your system. Well, they do mostly care about money, but in the future money, by I which I mean the highest profitability will be in digital. In other words, they are only doing it for money. If it wasn't a more profitable method, they woudl not give a damn if it was newer or ""the future"". And the profitability comes at the expensive of the consumer and employing anti-consumer tactics, THIS is why they want digital, it has ZERO to do with it being ""the future"". If they could somehow make more money by just releasing the game on Vinyl record over digital, they would. I'm not for streaming either, but my point was that execs are looking for ways to cut loss by getting rid of physical media. And my point is it's literally not possible. Case in point: PSNow has some pretty crummy input lag and I can't game that way. OnLives was even worse. And again, this is a limit of the very laws of physics. The speed of light is roughly 670,616,629 mph, which of course is stupidly fast.... but that still means it would take about 140-150ms give or take for it to travel around the world... and that's JUST counting the bare signal itself, not all the routing and networking hopping it would have to do that would SIGNIFICANTLY add several times more latency. It's not a problem that will be fixed in the future just by better tech, not unless you break the laws of physics. -No goal posts were moved. Steam was not a huge thing like it is today. It played a major roll in the advancement and its eventual success does nothing to discount my points on the Go. In fact, your point about the standard PSP selling well weakens the strength of using the Go as an example. Because of its sales, it had already saturated the market and there wasn't much reason for anyone to buy the Go. -I do see you moved the goalposts about the XBO though. I posted a quote from MS literally saying their used game stance was a major problem. There was nothing at all about digital games. You can't really argue against that no matter how many hairs you want to split. -Yes they are doing it for money. Like every business. In the future the money is in digital. That future isn't necessarily tomorrow but some time in the next ten or fifteen years. -I don't know why you're still going after streaming. I don't know what the odds of that happening are and I'm not really for it. To repeat, I brought it up to show that execs want to eliminate as much of the physical overhead as they can. Digital is where they're going and soon enough physical will be such a small piece of the pie that they'll cease making them.",,HappyGuy,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I'm equating it across everyone because that's a means to put the 1 billion hours into perspective. No it's not what it means, all it means is that it allows you to literally make up numbers so you can make a massively one-sided argument in your favor. You say it's not a small percentage, but you don't know any better than I do how many users are actually using it on a high level. And yet, you are kicking and screaming that your make up numbers are truth. My argument however is based on common sense that nobody ever is the majority user of something, as is the case with PSNow. You seem to have blinded yourself with some misguided sense that I'm defending Sony's lack of BC. Maybe because, well, you kinda have been doing exactly that this entire time? If it looks like a duck... If all you're trying to do is say ""MS is being better than Sony about BC"" then you're going about it an odd way is all. Someone questions the validity of some stat they spout and you go into some tirade to vehemently defend it. Says the person vehemently defending ""Nobody cares about BC"" with made up numbers. LOL you keep falling back on this accusation that I'm ""literally making up numbers"" like I fabricated them out of thin air or something. Go do some searches online and you'll find some Xbox sales reported at $35M or so in 2017, before MS stopped posting them. If you disagree with me going up to $40M I suppose that's fine, but it can't be that far off for the sake of this debate. And more sales just makes the 1 billion watered down more anyway. The other numbers are literally pulled out of that article you posted. So the numbers are valid, despite however you try to convince yourself otherwise. This really only boils down to you disagreeing the hours should be applied over the total number of users who have tried the feature. Yet you don't offer any better suggestion to evaluate because you don't have any better data to provide anyway.... just conjecture. I'm not even going to address the rest as long as you keep saying I'm using made up numbers.

I have a lot of experience with action games, but at the end of the day I love games for their stories and worlds, which being stuck on immense challenge after challenge can get in the way of fully experiencing. So my question is: How hard are the games on the easiest difficulty settings? Are they still difficult, or is playing on easy pretty much ""Can't Die Mode""? I only ask because people say that even on normal DMC 1 and 3 are hell, and that just doesn't sound like a great time to me. But I really want to give the series a shot if possible.

In essence, it's just an emulated port. Would you call paying for PSNow ""BC""? Or how about buying Virtual Console games... are those ""BC""? Making money on those old Xbox games wasn't because of ""BC."" It was because they were offered digitally for sale.",,WTGHookshot,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Unless you are an enthusiast and care about those little extra graphics which really are not that much or framerate depending on the mode you choose. And even on performance mode the game doesn't even hold a solid 60. Goes between at least 40 and 60. From the looks of the video you either get 60fps with PS4 Pro, or 30fps at 4k.

You say it's not a small percentage, but you don't know any better than I do how many users are actually using it on a high level. And yet, you are kicking and screaming that your make up numbers are truth. My argument however is based on common sense that nobody ever is the majority user of something, as is the case with PSNow. You seem to have blinded yourself with some misguided sense that I'm defending Sony's lack of BC. Maybe because, well, you kinda have been doing exactly that this entire time? If it looks like a duck... If all you're trying to do is say ""MS is being better than Sony about BC"" then you're going about it an odd way is all.

Thankfully the PS4 and XB1 are built on consoles that are extremely similar to essentially highly-specialized PCs, so future emulation should be easier if they keep with this setup in future generations. Now, that said, I do think Sony could implement some sort of workaround if the PS4 checks what disc is in the system, verifies that online with PSNow's servers, and allows access to the PSNow version of, say, a PS3 game on the service so long as the disc is in the console or the license is ""applied"" to the account for free. This is similar to how Microsoft does it with the XB1 and BC for 360 / original Xbox games, although there you download essentially the game and an emulator for the game as opposed to streaming the game from a server running it.",,theshoveller,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

For ps1 i have a working ps1. My smart phone, my pc, my laptop, my ps2, my ps3, psp, psv all play it. Seriously we need another way? How about ps2? Well theres ps2, ps3 (20, 60, 80). Then there are cfw ps3s, pc, smart phones and cfw ps4. Again another way is needed? Your argument is only for ps3 and psv. As these two have the lowest amount of ways until you figure in psnow and ps3 is no longer an issue plus the pc is getting there for it as well. Psp theres smartphones and pc and psv. Does ps4 need to do this? Then we have the biggest elephant psv. Currently there isnt much besides a psv. Pc emulation is finally starting for it so yay. But a lot of its games are available on ps4 and pc. So there is some issue here. But honestly BC is nice. But its not important. And i can live without it. Only time bc really matters is the first two years or when your console is shunned *cough xb1 cough*. Nah, I think there should be an official way to play these games on a current PlayStation platform. Saying ""I can emulate all those games on my PC"" doesn't really help PlayStation users much. Unofficial emulators can also have their own issues with accuracy with regards to games, as well as bugs and such. Why do you think sony put so much money into psnow? It has nearly the entire library of ps3. Its starting to have older ps4 games as well. And emulation isnt much of an issue as most emulators are on point. Only some really old retro consoles like genesis has. And at the end of the day sooner or later it will be left up to just emulation. And all bc is emulation.

Each PlayStation console has a different architecture. The PlayStation 2 achieved backward compatibility with PlayStation games only because it included the PS1 CPU. The PlayStation 3 achieved backward compatibility with PlayStation 2 games only because it included the Emotion Engine from the PS2. As is well known, Sony removed the Emotion Engine from later models of the PlayStation 3, which ended PS2 backward compatibility. Software emulation is certainly a consideration, and is how Sony was able to get the PlayStation 3 to play PSOne Classics both digitally and on CD-ROM. However, in order for the PlayStation 4 to use software emulation for PSOne Classics, Sony would have to write an all new emulator because the PS3 operates on a RISC based Power PC architecture whereas the PS4 operates on an x86 CISC based architecture. Even then, the PlayStaton 4 would be incapable of playing original PlayStation games on CD-ROM because the PS4 Blu Ray drive does not support CD playback of any kind. The reason why the Xbox One has robust support for backward compatibility is because only one of the three Xbox consoles was not x86. Getting original Xbox games to run on the Xbox One is pretty straightforward since both are x86, leaving the Xbox 360 as the only hurdle when it comes to software emulation. How do you explain that ps3 use a blu ray drive and able to play ps1? How do you explain that PlayStation Now can play ps1, ps2 and ps3 games on a ps4 console? The only thing ps4 can play is blu ray and dvd. They are pretty much lazy to do so and to save cost. Xbox has put some resource to bc and mildly successful. Nintendo just port and does like Sony on old title presently.",,tr1bes,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Let’s pretend no one has picked up an old Xbox game digitally because of bc (I know I picked up jade empire, kotor and Jedi academy personally) Bc can increase profits pretty easily Personally, I don't know if I would consider buying a game digitally as being ""BC."" In essence, it's just an emulated port. Would you call paying for PSNow ""BC""? Or how about buying Virtual Console games... are those ""BC""? Making money on those old Xbox games wasn't because of ""BC."" It was because they were offered digitally for sale. I mean, technically, Backwards compatibility doesn't refer to emulation at all. It means playing the older games natively on new hardware, and having it function identically to the original machine. So, even what Xbox is offering isn't true BC. I think everybody now just kinda refers to BC as ""old games available on new hardware"". :p",,kc44135,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Now, in 2018, the two consoles have come into their own — and they're more distinct from each other than ever before. They're also more affordable than ever before. But which to buy? The answer isn't so clear. 1. Price. AP Photo / Nam Y. Huh The Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 cost approximately the same amount of money: The base level for each is $250 to $300 in North America. The ranges in price come from bundle offerings, in which the consoles come with various games or extra controllers or services at a discount that still raise the overall cost. You're also likely to find sales that put the prices below $250. That's all before we start talking about the more powerful, more expensive versions of the consoles: the $400 PlayStation 4 Pro and the $500 Xbox One X. If you're looking for the best-looking games running on the most powerful console hardware, then you're looking at buying one of these step-up versions of the PS4 and the Xbox One. Both do everything the normal PS4 and Xbox One consoles do but have the added benefit of making games look ever better than usual. In the case of the Xbox One X, games are able to natively run with 4K/HDR visuals; the PlayStation 4 Pro offers a similar visual boost, though a slightly less impressive one. If you just bought a super-high-end 4K/HDR television and want to see what it can do, the Xbox One X is your best option when it comes to gaming. In general, though, for the average buyer, the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 are evenly matched when it comes to price. 2. Games. Sony This is where things start to divide pretty sharply: Sony's PlayStation 4 simply has more games you can play on only the PlayStation 4. From the ""Uncharted"" series to ""The Last of Us"" and ""Bloodborne,"" Sony has a far richer lineup of exclusive games on the PlayStation 4. Coming heavies like ""Spider-Man"" and ""Death Stranding"" loom large on the horizon. And major third-party games like ""Call of Duty,"" ""Assassin's Creed,"" ""Madden,"" and ""FIFA"" all show up on the PlayStation 4 as well as the Xbox One. It has been Microsoft's biggest problem with the Xbox One in recent years: Not enough great games that can be played on only the Xbox One. There's ""Halo"" and ""Forza,"" and the occasional new exclusive like ""Sea of Thieves"" and ""State of Decay 2,"" but nothing of the scale that Sony's PS4 has. For many, understandably, the game-library comparison is enough to tip the scale in favor of Sony's PlayStation 4. But look deeper and you'll find the competition is more complicated. 3. Services. Microsoft Sony and Microsoft offer nearly identical services, which serve as a means of accessing online multiplayer gaming as well as offering ""free"" games (as long as you remain a paying subscriber). In Sony's case, the service is PlayStation Network; in Microsoft's case, it's Xbox Live. They cost about the same amount of money ($60 a year) and offer access to online gaming on their respective platforms. Both dole out a handful of free games to paying subscribers every month, yours to play as long as you continue to subscribe. PlayStation Network and Xbox Live are industry-standard services at this point. What makes each console stand out in the services department is its Netflix-like gaming services: PlayStation Now and Xbox Game Pass. With PlayStation Now, users can stream more than 650 playable PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 games on a PlayStation 4 or a PC. The games are running elsewhere — you just start playing. It costs $20 a month, or $100 a year. With Game Pass, users can download and play more than 100 original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One games on the Xbox One. It costs $10 a month. Better yet: Any games Microsoft publishes show up on Game Pass at launch, including the next major ""Halo"" and ""Forza"" games. It's one of the best deals available in gaming for this alone. Xbox Game Pass is a strong argument for owning an Xbox One and offers a glimpse into the future of video game consoles. Instead of dropping $60 a game, for $10 a month you have access to a massive library that includes new, major games. That's huge .

Personally, I can't imagine playing games at 30 fps. I do own a 4k TV, but I don't care for 4k. So yea, PS4 Pro is the best God of War experience. Blue Rays? What is this you speak of? If you're Sony, you don't care if the PSNow is a system seller or not. The whole point is to get game developers to make games for your platform. A platform that you make 30% off all game sales. I wouldn't be shocked if God of War does end up on PSNow, just because there's a lot of hungry PC/Xbox/Nintendo owners who want to play the game, but don't want to buy the console. Better? Yes but barely. The 4K on both Pro and XB1 uses a special technique called Checkerboarding to even be able to run at 4k. Do you need a Pro however to play God of War and will it run smoothly on a standard? No you do not need a Pro and yes it will run fine on a standard PS4. It's all about what you are willing to spend. If you are a performance enthusiast then the Pro is for you. If you really don't care then you go a standard as it's cheaper and is more than enough to play any game. 30 FPS is more than fine for God of War. As is not playing it in 4K.",,Eleccybubb,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Going all-digital is basically telling everyone in a rural area of the US ( for a surprisingly broad definition of ""rural""! ) ""we don't want your money"". There's also the very large component of the userbase who treats gaming as ""disposable"". Buy a game, play the hell out of it for a few weeks, resell it for $40, buy another game and repeat.

The closer you are to one the better the service will be. Sony or Nintendo does not and never will have the scale to create a comprehensive and good Cloud Streaming product on their own. Sony have accepted that, hence why PSNow is not a focus anymore and they are focused in retaining their ecosystem in a cloud world. There's no guarantee that the closer you are to a data center the better your connection will be for ""said service"". Even then, how more problematic will it be for persons who are far off from these servers? So yes, to rely on close servers as a best case scenario towards optimum performance, is just not an answer that commands trust and reliance on the technology pitched. This service won't just be for persons close to the servers and yet, streaming games along with MP and more server processing isn't as simple as running a couple of dedicated servers for COD or HALO mp. There are so many factors in play for a good online experience, especially if you are streaming a game on top. For a game like KI, it had some smart ideas, but people have to remember it was not being streamed from any server, no server had to receive collison data or process A.I or any such computations or do any transmits of that sort. It did not have to stitch local computations in a small timeframe based on input.....In essence, the server has more work to do based on this pitch from MS, on top of streaming...... K.I run at 90fps (according to the dev) on the local box and did everything on the local box and it had good netcode on top, I think that eliminated many slowdowns locally (the 90fps that is), but last I saw, that game was not a perfect 60fps on XBONEX hardware so I'm not sure how true that is, or even towards helping with online play....all that much.......Still, GGPO/rollback netcode is excellent and I think it's the main reason for such good netcode and playability online in K.I...Yet, we can also eliminate 90fps as having any impact as much online, because skullgirl's netcode is just as good if not better than K.I and that runs at 60fps without the pronounced 30fps buffer. Mortal Kombat XL is not too far off and pretty solid too...... However, going back to this streaming pitch from MS, we must ask.....If there's going to be some computation work on a small cheaper cloud box, would that not limit graphical fidelity even for the larger and more capable local console? That is, if they must be at ""parite"".....or rather,.... Is this a way for MS to say, if you need a cheaper box, buy this one with lower fidelity when you stream your games, but they would make good money on services and subs there. On the flip, if you're into the highest end model, you get higher fidelity, you can buy the $500.00 box and there will be no mid gen console this time around....You buy what you need...according to your tastes and budget.. Generally As for this whole debate, history and precedence is what I argued. Yet I can see that this got some panties in a bind all twisted and naughty...The thing is, the history is right there for perusal, I did not make anything up, but it appears people would rather not hear the truth about things. This is certainly not MS's first rodeo on such talk. Streaming service (they spoke of a streaming service from Xbox one to PC, local only, which is not even as smooth as connecting remoteplay or shareplay), so my confidence in what they will accomplish online is not at an all time high....All you have to do is to read some articles if you don't remember or weren't around....I still remember heavy talk about dedicated servers, cloud computing etc in 2013... This is what MS said in 2013 Call of Duty: Ghosts and Titanfall will both have free dedicated multiplayer servers, and, according to Microsoft's Albert Penello, so will every other game on Xbox One. Penello responded on Twitter to a user inquiring about Microsoft's Xbox Live Compute program. Xbox Live lead program manager John Bruno spoke more about Xbox Live Compute in an Xbox Wire post. Beyond dedicated servers, Bruno reiterated Microsoft's plan for a future where developers can offload environmental details, AI, and more to free up console processing power for more player-centric concerns. But please read the entire thing for more perspective....here This is what MS delivered or the general concensus from said pitch in 2014 I remember attending a behind closed doors presentation on the power of the cloud during last year's E3, and listening to Microsoft engineering manager Jeff Henshaw tell a small gathering of journalists that Xbox One's 300,000 server cloud gave the next generation console a unique advantage. Developers could, Microsoft said, offload complex CPU work to the cloud, resulting in more impressive games - in theory. The problem was, no-one really understood what the cloud meant, exactly, or how it would improve games on Xbox One, save for Forza 5 having AI with ""human intelligence"". It was a confusing, abstract message muddied further by the term itself: the cloud, a marketing slogan without substance. Now Titanfall has released, the power of the cloud seems to have been something of a damp squib. It seems the cloud, in the short term at least, is about dedicated servers and how they make multiplayer gaming more seamless. And that - finally - is how Microsoft is now referring to the cloud. Read everything here.....and just think of what they delivered on such talk 5 years later.... -------- So basically many shifts in messaging with only slight changes and not much on delivery....From cloud computing, to full dedicated servers on all games, to full dedicated servers cloud powered, to next gen streaming service cloud powered with cloud computing. Nothing really changes just some slight meandering, but as I said, I will await to see if MS delivers on this streaming service that is now being pitched by MS fans as the pure gold mine on the yukon trail....

You are delusional. Pokemon doesnt rely on online? Pokemon GO fuck yourself lol pokemon fuckin gave us a reason to NETWORK OUR GAME BOYS as its main feature in the 90s. > You are so anti-Nintendo you sound like a Trump supporter bashing Hilary. This was directed towards me, and had nothing to do with what we were discussing, but brought them to my attention. I won't name them as it'd feel too much like a personal attack, but they were pretty active today on one of the popular posts. Most of his comments seem very odd, and naive, and aggressive in nature. > Switch is keeping Sony on its toes, it will surpass Xbox and be a strong #2 this gen. And Switch 2 will likely compete with the Pro version of the PS5. Hopefully MS steps back and focuses on what they should be doing - AR and VR with the Kinect tech, and staying out of everyones way. and > You had a great argument right until you dismissed Nintendo as being for kids, as if most kids don't play on PS4. Nintendo's fans are the ones that grew into adults playing the older systems, and raising their kids on Mario. I do agree both systems should get both games, but also give Nintendo credit for allowing SMT to get this much attention in the first place, even going as far as a Fire Emblem crossover to bring new fans to the series. and > Yeah the only reason there's a debate at all is that Nintendo is so far behind that everyone else gets to keep competing on feature lists. Once Nintendo someday catches up, all 3 will be so similar that no one will really debate it anymore. and > Xbox wins US, PS4 wins worldwide except Japan, Switch wins Japan and beats Xbox everywhere except USA. Xbox doesn't really even exist in Japan and > Unless the PS5 is farther out than everyone expects, it's not likely to pass the Wii. and > Kids are playing the exact same multiplayer games on Switch as on PS4 - Fortnite & Minecraft & Rocket League. No Overwatch but honestly its not worth arguing with someone who thinks Nintendo doesn't push the boundaries of the industry, as if the Switch itself isn't in the middle of doing that by just existing. With Breath of the Wild of all things as its flagship game. Nintendo's entire business model is to do the riskier things in the industry, and it works well for them most of the time. Despite a 4 year head start, Switch is going to completely overtake the Xbox One in total sales when the 2019 Pokemon game comes out, don't kid yourself. which was also directed at me, but anyway > Nintendo now overlaps on the half-gens. They will likely time the Switch 2 for when the PS5 Pro and Xbox Two XX come out in like 2022. The Wii U basically offset their whole business to not be aligned. It used to be that certain Novembers had 2 consoles launching head to head, but Nintendo won't ever launch head to head again after seeing how great a spring launch worked out. and > Yeah it looks like Switch is overtaking Xbox One in total sales sometime in the next year and a half, which is crazy good considering the other systems had a Wii-U sized head start. and > It was a good day for console wars nerds like us, getting tons of raw data from both Sony and Nintendo :D so they even admit to be console warring here. This isn't 2007, and I would hope moderators on Reddit wouldn't and don't act like children. This guy is just making up stuff to make nintendo look better, and has no real backing to his claims, and is very quick to just aggressively dismiss other peoples arguments. It reads like a 14 year old to be honest. but anyway, there's more > Yeah it is, having both MS and Sony is redundant, Nintendo has way more exclusives than MS does. Redundant? > The PS3 killed all of Sony's momentum. The console was almost DOA for 2 years, and only really started catching up to the 360 in the last 2 years of its 8 year life. Sony was able to creating another momentum boost with TLoU and some other late-gen strength which gave them a wave of support right in time for the PS4 launch, which also timed great with MS dropping the ball they were holding. ... that's all just way off... PS3 was always selling slightly faster than the 360 and took 8 years to catch up, the gap was pretty slim compared to other gens > They still will. I just bought a PS4, and the PSNow library is good enough that I actually don't intend to buy any other games other than Horizon and KH3 in reply to stream boxes taking over. He also has comments referring to buying spider-man, so it looks like he's just undermining the other systems again. This really is unacceptable behavior from a mod. This is middle school nonsense. It's clear he's quite hateful towards sony and microsoft, and is quite eager to lie and misinform to push his own feelings on others. This is really just sad. It's 2018. The console makers all have strong working relationships. They're all fans of each others systems and games. Reddit should be representing the best of these console communities, it's moderators definitely shouldn't be representing it's worst.",,FJLyons,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

With PS3, I know it's kind of a PITA due to how it was designed, so I suspect that that's a big reason why we don't see more of it. Thankfully the PS4 and XB1 are built on consoles that are extremely similar to essentially highly-specialized PCs, so future emulation should be easier if they keep with this setup in future generations. Now, that said, I do think Sony could implement some sort of workaround if the PS4 checks what disc is in the system, verifies that online with PSNow's servers, and allows access to the PSNow version of, say, a PS3 game on the service so long as the disc is in the console or the license is ""applied"" to the account for free. This is similar to how Microsoft does it with the XB1 and BC for 360 / original Xbox games, although there you download essentially the game and an emulator for the game as opposed to streaming the game from a server running it. Sony would lose so much money doing that, though. Streaming those games without being paid for those games would cost them a ton. Microsoft is able to avoid such a large cost because the BC games are downloaded, not streamed.",,WTGHookshot,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

PS2 was Emotion Engine (unique CPU architecture), PS3 is Cell, and PS4 is x86-64. The IBM Cell processor used in the PS3 used one dual threaded core (PPE) along with 7 co-processors (SPEs). It also used 256MB of GDDR3 and 256MB of a different kind of RAM, XDR. The IBM Xenon processor used in the XBox 360 used three of the dual threaded PPE cores found in the Cell processor, but modified with added extensions. The processor used 512MB of conventional GDDR3 RAM. The PPEs are more for general processing, and similar to the x86 architecture in that way. The SPEs are specialised, and not so similar to x86 architecture. Games were easier to program for on the XBox 360, and cross platform games for the PC usually ran well on the XBox 360 because of that. PlayStation 3 was more difficult to program for as IBM designed it for ""peak computational throughput over simplicity of program code"". Many cross platform games had worse performance on the PS3 than the XBox 360 as the developers couldn't utilise the Cell processor effectively, but those PS3 games that took advantage of the Cell CPU looked amazing, Last of Us for example. Keep in mind, the graphical aspect of emulation isn't the difficult part, its the central processing that is most complicated. The XBox 360 effectively had a simpler, less powerful CPU than the PS3 and the XBox One has a marginally faster CPU than the PS4, so Microsoft have an easier time of implementing the emulation than Sony would. Sony could do it with enough effort ($$$), but its not easy and Sony are still pushing PlayStation Now which includes PS3 games. -Edited- Kept trying to improve clarity, still not happy with it.",,FabMan,Australia,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

But a lot of its games are available on ps4 and pc. So there is some issue here. But honestly BC is nice. But its not important. And i can live without it. Only time bc really matters is the first two years or when your console is shunned *cough xb1 cough*. Nah, I think there should be an official way to play these games on a current PlayStation platform. Saying ""I can emulate all those games on my PC"" doesn't really help PlayStation users much. I also just don't think on principal that people should have to turn to PC emulation or hacking their Consoles to have access to older PlayStation games. Unofficial emulators can also have their own issues with accuracy with regards to games, as well as bugs and such.",,kc44135,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Phil Spencer, Microsoft's gaming chief, revealed the company is hard at work building a streaming game service for any device. ""Our cloud engineers are building a game streaming network to unlock console gaming on any device,"" says Spencer, and the service will work across Xbox, PCs, or phones. Spencer didn't give any firm dates on when the service will be available, but he's previously teased Xbox game streaming within three years. Many have tried and failed to create a game streaming service, and it's a challenging thing to get right. Sony acquired streaming games service OnLive only to shut it down, and it previously acquired Gaikai, which eventually became part of its PlayStation Now service. Nvidia is trying to stream games to PCs, but all these existing services will suffer some form of latency that hold them back from being widely used. Spencer also revealed what should be obvious: Microsoft is making new Xbox consoles. According to Spencer, Microsoft's teams are ""deep into architecturing the next Xbox consoles."" Microsoft's research teams are also working on artificial intelligence for gaming. ""Our experts in Microsoft Research are developing the future of gaming AI, so the worlds and characters we enjoy will be more rich and more immersive,"" explains Spencer.[/QUOTE] I'm not really sold on the idea of streaming games. The reason I prefer to buy physical copies of a game is because I want to own it. Here, you are basically renting a game. You don't own it, you have to pay a monthly fee to play it, and Microsoft can take it down at anytime (like Netflix's will do with a movie). Maybe I'm just being a Debbie downer.

To them it doesn't matter what digital dales are for mobile gaming, they only care about their games, and the money it brings in. This You think any of them give a crap about what is ""the future""? They only want digital because it basically gives them a monopoly on sales AND lets them control your access to your games even after they sell them to you, that's making them drool dollar signs. Look at how well the PSP Go and original Xbox One plans turned out when they actually attempted it though... Also: ""Paperless offices are the future"" - Xerox, 1970s. Guess what? The vast majority of offices still use hundreds to thousands of sheets of paper a day. PSP Go was a late iteration of a dying, poorly performing console. The idea was a little ahead of its time, too. Xbox One? That was never designed to be all digital. It failed out of the gates because of their stance on used games. These guys definitely care about the future and one of the best ways to save money is to eliminate physical game production. I think we mentioned it ITT too, that they want to ditch physical so badly that they're already talking about getting rid of consoles and turning their brands into streaming services. Sony is getting ready with PSNow. It's nowhere near ready yet imo, but it's close. One of the biggest, if not the biggest costs/losses Sony/MS/Nintendo encounter are from making physical consoles. They almost always take a loss on them with the idea they'll make money back with game sales and online services. Regarding Xerox lol, I guess just because this is a fun debate, offices still have a use for paper. Although I'm willing to bet there's a major decrease in paper consumption in the modern world compared to the 70s. I don't think it will be possible to get the actual stats though. Streaming services for games won't be happening for decades to come, just look at the posts from people who always want there games to run better, streaming will take all of that in the other direction, not to mention the onternet infrastructure is no where near good enough to handle this. While going digital will save the publishers money, mostly on shipping, and handling, we end users will never see any of that savings, and once the only places you can buy console games is through MS, or Sony they will be dictating their store prices, no reason to run as many big sales, or price cuts when they are the only place to buy. Yes, they will be careful of prices, but only to extract maximum profits from us. Right now having the physical option keeps them in check somewhat.

This is obviously for those who want a cheap console and/or an experience that they can play on a underpowered device. It's like asking why is Fornite on Mobile, or why is PlayStation Now on the PC. If you don't like to play on mobile then it's not for you is it but if Microsoft can give a console and PC level of detail on a underpowered device for cheaper than it would be to buy an Xbox or a comparable PC then that's great, just as long as they also have a box that doesn't stream which we are already play games like now. It's this attitude that we must crap on everything first which is so frustrating even if it's not for us. I'm not crapping on it. Personally I don't like streaming games, but I can see how there's a use for some people. I'm not as pro as some people here with regards the tech (in terms of how well it will work), but I'm more than willing to wait and see. Someone said earlier in the thread, the problem with rumours like this, even if they're based on a truth, all the information isn't there so the idea gets distorted or just badly presented. Until we see what this actually is none of us can judge it. As things stand I think streaming is a hard sell, I don't think the hardcore want it and I don't think the casuals want it, but it doesn't mean there isn't a niche. I doubt MS expect this to sell gangbusters off the bat, they probably accept it will be a gradual success if it's a success at all. I mean, if you want a negative the biggest one is that if the industry goes majority streaming that's not good for us as gamers, nor as consumers, but I'm not predicting the apocalypse based on a rumour, there's no point.",,B_Signal,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Why are so many posts negative/cynical about this? I’d understand if this was the main console, but it’s not. Its soley cause its an Xbox thread.

7eee919c-3c6f-47b4-b686-65bd72194197,7/29/2018,https://www.reddit.com/r/vitahacks/comments/92x875/for_those_having_trouble_with_moonlightvitas/#,"Greetings all, Like a few of you, I had high hopes for moonlight-vita and was a bit confused when button mapping didn't just kinda work out of the box. But after toying with custom mappings for a while, it became increasingly clear that the issue wasn't with the mapping at all, but rather with my perceptions of how the application was supposed to function. So I went and asked a couple of people on the Discord channel to correct my misconceptions. They basically spoke two very polite sentences and set me on the right path. So now I'm just outlining the path to the solution I needed, hoping it will help others. Let me preface instructions with an explanation. Moonlight was never meant to be used the way I was trying to use it. Yes, it's streaming functions are, but the whole point of the custom mappings isn't - as I originally thought - to allow you to map, say, X on the Vita to left mouse click on the PC, it's actually just to do things like swap L1/R1 with L2/R2. In short, moonlight uses the Vita's controls as a gamepad, period, there's no way to change this. It was not designed to be reconfigured. So for this you'll want to stay on the stock mapping (disable custom mapping). First, and I urge you not to skip this part, update. Not just Moonlight, but also GeForce Experience. The reason I'm saying this is that after I updated yesterday (and I'd updated only a week previously), for the first time ever - while connecting via Moonlight - my PC suddenly installed drivers to recognize the Vita as an X360 controller, and I've spoken to a couple of people who tell me this isn't happening for them. I suspect this is important to fix that issue. Second, we'll need a piece of middle-ware - this is what I took away from the kind folks in #vita-help on the Discord server. I was recommend, and have now successfully implemented [Xpadder](https://xpadder.com/). This accepts Xinput (gamepad) input, and allows you to map the buttons to execute keyboard pressed, mouse movements, mouse buttons, etc. I'm told there's a freeware version on the site, though I personally just paid the ten bucks for it, as I figured I'd get my money's worth (spoiler: I was right). I won't lie, the app looks like something out of the Win95 era, but damn if it doesn't do the job perfectly - at least, on Win7. I ran into a weird issue here, and I don't rightly understand why this happens, so I want to lay it out before getting into the mapping. After I opened the Xpadder application and started to familiarize myself with how it worked, I noticed that the 'auto-detection' function wasn't registering input from my Vita controller, but that Windows itself was seeing the button presses (gamepad calibration confirmed this.) It wasn't until I noticed that at the top of the window there were two unlabeled rectangular grey boxes that I started to put one and one together. For some reason, my Vita is detected as one device sometimes, and a second device at other times. So each of those boxes represents a gamepad as the system sees it. Accordingly, I simply saved the same mappings to both profiles, and whenever the gamepad decides to switch from being Device 1 to Device 2 or back, it just seamlessly picks it up and there's no issue. Now, to the mapping. There are two kinds of mapping. One maps buttons on your Vita to the PC application (since Xpadder was not designed specifically for Moonlight or Vita, it has to know how to read any Xinput device) - this I will call the controller mapping. The other maps the buttons FROM the controller mapping to the actual mouse/keyboard buttons you want executed when you press the button on the Vita. For me, this was the missing piece of the puzzle, and once I had it running everything was bloody *perfect*. I've got to give props to everyone involved with Moonlight/Moonlight-Vita, this is hands down the best streaming tech I've ever used, it makes PSNow look like RealPlayer video in comparison. I've probably played 10hr on it already, and I've not encounter a single glitch, crash, or graphical corruption. Anyways, I hope this helps some poor lost soul in the future.",,yukikomori,United States of America,,,Negative,Unclassified,Reddit,,,,,,,,
