Router and playstation now ok but still no Sky (but program guide and info button are still showing program information!!). Remote connection is enabled on the router and my profile is up to date.

This is from an article on Tweaktown: Of course, Ryan then slams the fidelity of old-school PlayStation games, which obviously look terrible on 1080p HDTVs. That's why Sony would remaster them and sell them for $14.99 a pop, like it does with its other PS2 games on PS4. ""When we've dabbled with backwards compatibility, I can say it is one of those features that is much requested, but not actually used much. That, and I was at a Gran Turismo event recently where they had PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 games, and the PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?"" Just once, I would like a real, die hard gamer to work and have real influence in a company. I can go out and buy a PS3 system/games for a cheaper price than that scam called PSNow. I can even buy a PS2 and get all the games I want for it. But people don't want to do that. We want remasters of games, we want new support and a new, sleek look for games like God Hand, Legend of Dragoon, Final Fantasy, & dotHack, to name a few. Do I think it's ridiculous to have to pay $20 for a game I already own on PS2, just to play a cleaner version of it? A little. BUT, when you hit that vein of nostalgia, just like I have for God Hand, I would go as far as paying SIXTY dollars just to play an HD remaster. Why not take the amazing cult classics and super popular franchises that Sony owns and just fucking re-release them and profit at the same time? At the very least there should be a dedicated poll to what game gets remastered every week or so. I'm so disappointed in Sony and I have been ever since the release of the PS4. I wish they still cared about their old titles and the people who played them.",,GirardxH,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,Why doesn't anyone at Sony see the potential in PS2 on PS4?,,,

No information was available as to what it addressed (or what the new version was) when selecting 'More Details', but since I've experienced - let's say - less than stellar performance from the set since installing the previous update (ending in 0137NAB), I took an unceremonious leap of faith, restarted the TV and let it do its thing. The result is new version PKG3.915.0139NAB. I've searched high and low for information on this version and can find nothing. I can tell you this information from Settings / About: Android security patch level: August 1, 2017 Version: 6.0.1 Build: SVP4KDTV15_UC-user 6.0.1 MMB29V.S41 3.915 release-keys What they leave in, what they take out - I don't know. Perhaps it is just me, but the set does appear to be a bit snappier responding to the remote for nav, selection and volume control. YMMV. Thus far, no problems, but inquiring minds like mine would really like to know if this is just a security update, or if it is designed to address some of the shortcomings of the previous build & possibly add (or, in the case of Twitter) remove features... ====================::==================== Hi Gregthecanuck, Welcome to Sony Community!

This is the case with Bloodbourne as Sony sponsored the development of the game to make it a PS4 exclusive. A partial list of console exclusives are... * Practically all games released by Nintendo * Gran Turismo series (Sony Exclusive) * Forza series (only part of the series are XBox only exclusives. This has been ported to PC w/ Windows 10) * Fable II (360 exclusive) * Saint's Row (Xbox exclusive) * Dragon Quest series (have mobile ports, but no official PC releases) * Final Fantasy I & II (have mobile ports, but no official PC releases) Please be aware that this is NOT an exhaustive list & it's subject to change without notice. While the usage of emulators can bypass the console exclusivity, it's also a legally murky realm that not officially supported by any console maker... so people don't count it. In the event a 1st party developer goes go 3rd party, like the case with Sega, console exclusivity gets thrown out the window. Sega has released a Sega Genesis / Mega Drive Classic collection on PC as an ""a la carte"" micro-transaction system (so you can pick & choose which games you want) with a ""prix fixe"" option (so you can buy everything at one price). Hope this sheds some light on the subject. ====================::==================== All console games are ""released"" for PC when an emulator is developed. You can currently play a lot of Wii U and PS3 games on pc right now using emulators. Also using the PSnow streaming service, you can also play PS3/PS4 games which are available with that service on PC. Its getting to the point where developers will start porting games to PC or at least have a streaming type service to play console exclusives on PC since pc gamers will either pay for your game and play it on PC, or they will use an emulator, pirate the game and not pay and play the game on PC. We will still download and play games if they don't release them, so it's in their own best interests to just have an option to play on pc. Its just going to become more and more available because of that fact.",,Konakona,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,What games like Bloodbourne will never be released for the PC?,,,

166354551213,10/13/2017,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/166354551213,"One of the Xbox One’s standout features is backwards compatibility support for Xbox 360 games. There are more than 400 titles in the catalog right now, and the library is seemingly always growing. Microsoft is committed to backwards compatibility now and in the long run, Xbox boss Phil Spencer told GameSpot at the Brazil Game Show today.

In June, there was a report that said Xbox One owners “largely ignore” the backwards compatibility feature. Microsoft responded by pointing out that around half of all Xbox One owners have used the feature, tallying some 508 million hours using the service. Spencer doubled down on this, saying it’s categorically untrue that it’s an ignored feature.

“It’s not true that people don’t play it. I’ve seen those online arguments about nobody uses it or everybody uses it. It’s not true that everybody plays backwards compatibility games, it’s not true that no one does,” he said. “A lot of the data is third party data so I can’t really tell you how many people are playing a certain game; it’s not my game. I think the best signal we had so far is when Black Ops II landed and that month it hit NPD’s Top 10 that month for game sales. An Xbox 360 game that’s years old, that shows that people care.”

The Xbox One is the only new-generation console that has true backwards compatibility support. The PlayStation 4, by comparison, requires users to re-purchase older games to play on the system through PlayStation Now and the PS2 Classics program.

“We continue to invest in back-compat because it matters. Not because somebody else [Sony] doesn’t have it. If somebody else did it tomorrow, we wouldn’t stop. We see it as a commitment to our customers that the games you buy from us [will work on new platforms].”

In addition to Xbox 360 games, the backwards compatibility lineup will add support for Original Xbox games before the end of the year. Microsoft is “really close” to launching this, Spencer told us, also teasing some news about support on Xbox One X.

Also in our interview, Spencer spoke about how he wants to move beyond the old way of thinking that when you buy a new console, your purchases for the older device are rendered useless. That’s part of the reason why backwards compatibility is so important to Microsoft.

“I want to give gamers a choice. It’s about growing gaming not being divisive and artificially trying to move you ahead. That’s why Xbox One X plays the same games Xbox One S does. PC has done this for years. It’s not rocket science in how you figure this out.”

Quote: : It's A Myth That Xbox One Backwards Compatibility Is Ignored, Exec Says One of the Xbox One's standout features is backwards compatibility support for Xbox 360 games. There are more than 400 titles in the catalog right now, and the library is seemingly always growing. Microsoft is committed to backwards compatibility now and in the long run, Xbox boss Phil Spencer told GameSpot at the Brazil Game Show today. In June, there was a report that said Xbox One owners ""largely ignore"" the backwards compatibility feature. Microsoft responded by pointing out that around half of all Xbox One owners have used the feature, tallying some 508 million hours using the service. Spencer doubled down on this, saying it's categorically untrue that it's an ignored feature. ""It's not true that people don't play it. I've seen those online arguments about nobody uses it or everybody uses it. It's not true that everybody plays backwards compatibility games, it's not true that no one does,"" he said. ""A lot of the data is third party data so I can't really tell you how many people are playing a certain game; it's not my game. I think the best signal we had so far is when Black Ops II landed and that month it hit NPD's Top 10 that month for game sales. An Xbox 360 game that's years old, that shows that people care."" The Xbox One is the only new-generation console that has true backwards compatibility support. The PlayStation 4, by comparison, requires users to re-purchase older games to play on the system through PlayStation Now and the PS2 Classics program. ""We continue to invest in back-compat because it matters. Not because somebody else [Sony] doesn't have it. If somebody else did it tomorrow, we wouldn't stop. We see it as a commitment to our customers that the games you buy from us [will work on new platforms]."" In addition to Xbox 360 games, the backwards compatibility lineup will add support for Original Xbox games before the end of the year. Microsoft is ""really close"" to launching this, Spencer told us, also teasing some news about support on Xbox One X. Also in our interview, Spencer spoke about how he wants to move beyond the old way of thinking that when you buy a new console, your purchases for the older device are rendered useless. That's part of the reason why backwards compatibility is so important to Microsoft. ""I want to give gamers a choice. It's about growing gaming not being divisive and artificially trying to move you ahead. That's why Xbox One X plays the same games Xbox One S does. PC has done this for years. It's not rocket science in how you figure this out."" For more on our conversation with Spencer, check out the stories linked below, and come back soon to see our full Q&A. https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mi.../1100-6454005/ ====================::==================== I like it.

This is from an article on Tweaktown: Of course, Ryan then slams the fidelity of old-school PlayStation games, which obviously look terrible on 1080p HDTVs. That's why Sony would remaster them and sell them for $14.99 a pop, like it does with its other PS2 games on PS4. ""When we've dabbled with backwards compatibility, I can say it is one of those features that is much requested, but not actually used much. That, and I was at a Gran Turismo event recently where they had PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 games, and the PS1 and the PS2 games, they looked ancient, like why would anybody play this?"" Just once, I would like a real, die hard gamer to work and have real influence in a company. I can go out and buy a PS3 system/games for a cheaper price than that scam called PSNow. I can even buy a PS2 and get all the games I want for it. But people don't want to do that. We want remasters of games, we want new support and a new, sleek look for games like God Hand, Legend of Dragoon, Final Fantasy, & dotHack, to name a few. Do I think it's ridiculous to have to pay $20 for a game I already own on PS2, just to play a cleaner version of it? A little. BUT, when you hit that vein of nostalgia, just like I have for God Hand, I would go as far as paying SIXTY dollars just to play an HD remaster. Why not take the amazing cult classics and super popular franchises that Sony owns and just fucking re-release them and profit at the same time? At the very least there should be a dedicated poll to what game gets remastered every week or so. I'm so disappointed in Sony and I have been ever since the release of the PS4. I wish they still cared about their old titles and the people who played them. I'm a huge PS1/2 fan and most of the games just don't hold up, the selection is so small and most of them are so poor compared to what could be on there.",,GirardxH,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,Why doesn't Sony see the potential in PS2 on PS4,,,

Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to ""Schema-nun Antonia"" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are 40 demons. Smoking is censer to the devil. Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on 7 meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens. America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion; using contraceptives for 1 year = 5 aborted kids. Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of tight pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile). Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell for 33 and a half years; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chipped using IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside you home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs; stay away from cats [Afanasiy Sidyachiy]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (hemisphere); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: ""Christ is here; Christ is there"" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flour from mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm) because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign of the cross (last mercy for you will be to cut your forearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't using chemtrails; they're also in gov't food and medicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of aborted fetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human flesh is in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging, anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-12 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse, Chrtistians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos Virgin Mary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World Passport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyes scan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. Gabriel Urgebadze said that they do it on index finger when they scan your finger. Basically, try to avoid new documents at all cost. Police will microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, green mark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can't track you; burn documents because they're from Satan. The Most Holy Trinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. Social Security Number). People who die with these Satanic documents go to concentration camp in hell to await Final Judgement; once the BEAST Computer is burned down, souls will be released for Final Judgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceased relatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristian names given during antibaptism by the beast system; or just burn these documents because gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from half a millenium ago describes Final Judgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had little boards (plastic cards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell twice a year [at midnight between September 18 and September 19 and similarly on November 20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding ""and relatives by flesh up to Adam"") so that they are rescued if they're in hell] (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell. It's a big sin to remember the dead with wreaths (because demons put these wreaths on their necks if they're in hell with their hands tied up behind their back while hanging by their hands), meat, alcohol, sweets, and worldly music. Demons print icons on saints in newspapers so that you throw these newspapers in the trash blaspheming these saints. Crosses on soles of shoes and back of pants are blasphemy. Demons make carpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walk on crosses. Playing cards mock how Jesus suffered on the cross: clubs (cross on which Jesus was crucified), diamonds (four nails Jesus was crucified with), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesus was given to drink), spades (spear with which Jesus was pierced). Cremation is devil worship; only blasphemers such as Lenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this. After China attacks Russia, Ruski Orthodox Tsar (shown by resurrected Seraphim of Sarov) will come to power in Russia; this Tsar will slay traitors inside church and gov't; as a result, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist. Ecumenism has 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink), representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same Supreme Being [aka the devil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism will have Pagans walking on their heads in hell. Arkhimandrite Antonin Kapustin left a prophecy that John the Baptist's living space will become a church and it will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist. Patriarch Kirill of Russia blessed this church. When priests pray for current gov't (instead of praying for future Tsar), Jesus gets up from His throne and turns His back to them.

Quote: : It's A Myth That Xbox One Backwards Compatibility Is Ignored, Exec Says One of the Xbox One's standout features is backwards compatibility support for Xbox 360 games. There are more than 400 titles in the catalog right now, and the library is seemingly always growing. Microsoft is committed to backwards compatibility now and in the long run, Xbox boss Phil Spencer told GameSpot at the Brazil Game Show today. In June, there was a report that said Xbox One owners ""largely ignore"" the backwards compatibility feature. Microsoft responded by pointing out that around half of all Xbox One owners have used the feature, tallying some 508 million hours using the service. Spencer doubled down on this, saying it's categorically untrue that it's an ignored feature. ""It's not true that people don't play it. I've seen those online arguments about nobody uses it or everybody uses it. It's not true that everybody plays backwards compatibility games, it's not true that no one does,"" he said. ""A lot of the data is third party data so I can't really tell you how many people are playing a certain game; it's not my game. I think the best signal we had so far is when Black Ops II landed and that month it hit NPD's Top 10 that month for game sales. An Xbox 360 game that's years old, that shows that people care."" The Xbox One is the only new-generation console that has true backwards compatibility support. The PlayStation 4, by comparison, requires users to re-purchase older games to play on the system through PlayStation Now and the PS2 Classics program. ""We continue to invest in back-compat because it matters. Not because somebody else [Sony] doesn't have it. If somebody else did it tomorrow, we wouldn't stop. We see it as a commitment to our customers that the games you buy from us [will work on new platforms]."" In addition to Xbox 360 games, the backwards compatibility lineup will add support for Original Xbox games before the end of the year. Microsoft is ""really close"" to launching this, Spencer told us, also teasing some news about support on Xbox One X. Also in our interview, Spencer spoke about how he wants to move beyond the old way of thinking that when you buy a new console, your purchases for the older device are rendered useless. That's part of the reason why backwards compatibility is so important to Microsoft. ""I want to give gamers a choice. It's about growing gaming not being divisive and artificially trying to move you ahead. That's why Xbox One X plays the same games Xbox One S does. PC has done this for years. It's not rocket science in how you figure this out."" For more on our conversation with Spencer, check out the stories linked below, and come back soon to see our full Q&A. https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mi.../1100-6454005/ ====================::==================== I'd rather not have to swap shit around and still be able to play what I want. Also people who are jumping on board with a console family for the first time will have the opportunity to buy old system games without having to buy the old system.

I don't want to spoil anything in case you care about plot, but if you're a fan of characters with superhero-like superpowers and open world-type stuff, then it's a great game. I haven't finished the sequel, but it's been pretty great so far. There's also Sly Cooper: Theives in Time which is pretty cartoony and reminiscent of A Hat In Time in terms of its design and gameplay (at least I think so, from what I've seen).

Third parties can make their own Switch versions, Microsoft and Sony can put the Switch in their ecosystem as long as you have a login. Xbox is already doing this for Minecraft, and both have dipped their toes in this idea for PC users. Microsoft has Windows 10, Sony has PSNow that has PS3 and PS4 games available to it. Nintendo knows they're not competing with them, so I don't see how they would mind. The BIGGEST issue would be playing said games online. I think Minecraft on PC and Switch require Xbox Live Gold, but I couldn't imagine having to pay for the other two to play their games online, unless there's some partnership involving Nintendo's online payment.

166389755743,10/14/2017,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/166389755743,"One of the Xbox One’s standout features is backwards compatibility support for Xbox 360 games. There are more than 400 titles in the catalog right now, and the library is seemingly always growing. Microsoft is committed to backwards compatibility now and in the long run, Xbox boss Phil Spencer told GameSpot at the Brazil Game Show today.

In June, there was a report that said Xbox One owners “largely ignore” the backwards compatibility feature. Microsoft responded by pointing out that around half of all Xbox One owners have used the feature, tallying some 508 million hours using the service. Spencer doubled down on this, saying it’s categorically untrue that it’s an ignored feature.

“It’s not true that people don’t play it. I’ve seen those online arguments about nobody uses it or everybody uses it. It’s not true that everybody plays backwards compatibility games, it’s not true that no one does,” he said. “A lot of the data is third party data so I can’t really tell you how many people are playing a certain game; it’s not my game. I think the best signal we had so far is when Black Ops II landed and that month it hit NPD’s Top 10 that month for game sales. An Xbox 360 game that’s years old, that shows that people care.”

The Xbox One is the only new-generation console that has true backwards compatibility support. The PlayStation 4, by comparison, requires users to re-purchase older games to play on the system through PlayStation Now and the PS2 Classics program.

“We continue to invest in back-compat because it matters. Not because somebody else [Sony] doesn’t have it. If somebody else did it tomorrow, we wouldn’t stop. We see it as a commitment to our customers that the games you buy from us [will work on new platforms].”

In addition to Xbox 360 games, the backwards compatibility lineup will add support for Original Xbox games before the end of the year. Microsoft is “really close” to launching this, Spencer told us, also teasing some news about support on Xbox One X.

Also in our interview, Spencer spoke about how he wants to move beyond the old way of thinking that when you buy a new console, your purchases for the older device are rendered useless. That’s part of the reason why backwards compatibility is so important to Microsoft.

“I want to give gamers a choice. It’s about growing gaming not being divisive and artificially trying to move you ahead. That’s why Xbox One X plays the same games Xbox One S does. PC has done this for years. It’s not rocket science in how you figure this out.”

FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif., Oct. 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ – One of the most exhilarating concepts to come out of Hyundai’s design studios makes a triumphant return today in Polyphony Digital’s hotly anticipated next-generation racing simulation, Gran Turismo Sport, now on sale for the Playstation 4. 





The N 2025 Vision Gran Turismo is Hyundai’s entry in GT Sport’s top racing class, Group 1, where it competes against other manufacturers’ Vision Gran Turismo projects and a multitude of well-known real-world prototype racing cars from different manufacturers including Aston Martin, Bugatti and McLaren. 

“The N 2025 Vision GT is our ambitious take on what we think prototype racing could look like in the not-too-distant future. We’re thrilled to see it presented anew in one of the most visually stunning racing simulations ever created,” said Chris Chapman, Chief Designer at the Hyundai Design Center in Irvine, CA. “This concept is a point of pride for Hyundai on so many fronts. It effortlessly combines beauty and function as a racing car, and it boasts a fuel-cell powertrain that is as progressive as the bodywork wrapped around it. It’s exciting to know that players who drive it in Gran Turismo Sport can now do so in pursuit of a real FIA Championship that’s exclusive to the game.”

The N 2025 Vision Gran Turismo is joined by four other Hyundai race cars, each based on the Genesis Coupe, and each tied to a specific in-game racing class:

 * Hyundai Genesis Coupe 3.8 Track (N class) 
 * Hyundai Genesis Coupe Gr.3 (Group 3 class) 
 * Hyundai Genesis Coupe Gr.4 (Group 4 class) 
 * Hyundai Genesis Coupe Gr.B Rally Car (Group B class)

Those services are limited to 720p games because it would require way higher bandwith speeds to push through more data. In other words theres no way you'd be playing high demanding games on max settings with high fps any time soon. Also server lag increases significantly and most online games would be considered virtually unplayable. It could work well for indie titles or smaller games in general, but those don't take a long time to download since they are generally 2-3 gigs at max, so why constantly sip away at your data cap if you could download the entire thing in a couple minutes. Not to forget that the infrastructure costs would be huge. The only real upsides are that it adds to the ""games as a service"" model we seem to be flowing to, and your final 2 points. Though I doubt a lot of devs would develop their games just to be played of a server. Because it would limit their playerbase based on internet speeds even more than system specs. Looking at how many people complain about the always online stuff going on in a lot of games these days. A reliable internet connection doesn't come as easy as it may seem to a lot of people.",,JonathanHu,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,
