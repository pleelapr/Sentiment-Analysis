For instance the game I really want to play is Bloodborne the most but that game was on sale for cheaper than the sale price of one month of PSNow. I just think Game Pass is a better deal because the normal price is as cheap as PSNow's sale price and the game selection is a better deal to me because it has more recent games. I would have bought Forza Horizon 4 eventually when it was on sale but now I can just play the game with Game pass for 6 months and during those 6 months I will get another new game that I wanted in Ashen. Like its paying for itself essentially.,,sakata32,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Sony support Doesn’t just roll over for the customer like many other institutions do these days. Understandable considering how much fraud they deal with, but it can be awful when you have actual issues with them. My own personal experience: They once granted me a refund for a game I bought and had issue with, which was great. However, a year later I rented a PlayStation Now game that the network test claimed would work without issue, but in reality the game lagged like crazy and was unplayable. Sony’s system failed me and took my money, so I called for a refund and was told that they gave me a one time refund already and I could no longer get refunds. So, basically, their practice is to assume you’re lying.",,stanleytuccimane,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Maybe it is but that doesnt seem to be the consensus. And its not an excuse. If I think their day 1 titles look bad I won't subscribe if I dont have an active membership at that time. The fact that I can try out new games to see if I'd like it or not is whats cool about having day 1 games though. Also like I said its only $10 a month usually and not $20 like PSNow (or $45 for 3 months). That means I can try it out when I want it at any time for an affordable price.,,sakata32,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Uncharted 4 - One of the worst in the series, rated high for its presentation... as usual. Bloodborne - On PSNOW, playable on PC Only a matter of time until Uncharted is on PSNOW, and God of War, and Spiderman. the list of AAAE's is tiny. That in no way shape or form out ranks the many excellent AA games available (on any system) .. an AAAE is not worth 10 AAEs by any stretch... maybe 2-3 at most.

I know that characters from the first game are in the second, but that's about it. ====================::==================== User Info: caboose84 caboose84 12 hours ago #9 Well, the point of most prequels seems to be fan service, they typically expect you to have at least an understanding of who the characters are, and the events of the previous games/sequels. I don’t think I’ve ever seen/played a prequel that worked particularly well as a stand-alone experience, or at least as an entry-point to a series. God of War: Ascension for example would be a terrible game to start the series with, because it talks about events that are uncovered/learned of in the first GoW, and expects you to know who Kratos is, how he became the Ghost of Sparta, who Ares/Zeus are, etc. My point is, you could only benefit from playing through Red Dead Redemption before playing the 2nd, even if it is a prequel, because like virtually every prequel in existence, it expects you to know who some of these characters are, and it will no doubt reference or foreshadow events that are going to happen in the first. Plus, like others have said in previous topics about this, if you ever intend on going back and playing the original, it’ll only feel that much more dated and clunky in comparison to this one. You can play it on the PS3, 360, XONE through backwards compatibility, or PS4 through PSNow, and it’s like $15-$20 for the GotY Edition with all of the DLC, so it’s not like it’s a hard game to get ahold of and play. I just don’t see why you wouldn’t wanna play it before playing the 2nd game.

I know people are gonna say its ridiculous to hope for that but I'd still love for that to happen.,,sakata32,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

You can fully download games and play them as much as you want for only $9.99/month. The only requirement is that the game has to be available on Game Pass when you play the game. Meaning that games can be withdrawn and added from time to time. Which is reasonable. It's pretty much like a digital renting service, similar to how you could rent physical games back in the old days. The library is pretty good too, with a few AAA games that is being sold in the digital store for close to the full release price, but with Game Pass you can play those games for only $9.99/month and easily finish one or two games in less than a month. You can save a lot of money with this service as long as there is at least one game in the Game Pass library that you want to play during your membership. You can also cancel and subscribe to the service whenever you want to do that. I just hope that they keep adding a lot more games in the future. More from third party developers. I can see how this could potentially be a highly profitable service for Microsoft. What are your thoughts about the service? ====================::==================== supersoulfly said: ↑ It's okay. Click to expand... It gets a lot better if you compare it to something like PlayStation Now. PlayStation Now: $19.99/month. Streaming instead of real backwards compatibility. Only PS4 games can be downloaded to local storage. PS3 games has to be streamed. Game Pass: $9.99/month. Full backwards compatibility.

While there isn't currently much to write home about in regards to Nintendo's Online service, I must say the way they have handled the classic games has been great, and something many fans had hoped Nintendo would do for a very long time. It's one clean app, and the games are offered to you in a Netflix style. I imagine (hope) they will do this for each console. One app per console as they continue to add more and more games to each console. Nice and organized. But if they bring the old format back, that would mean purchasing individual games...all over again. No thanks. Wii and Wii U was enough, I'm not doing that crap again. Not only is it messy to have hundreds of VC games littering your eShop, it's also very expensive. A Netflix style of delivery is much better for the consumer and actually adds value to the Online service in the long run. I hope this code is simply a reference to future apps they will be adding, the same way they rolled out the NES app. Here's hoping Nintendo doesn't screw up one of the few good things they have done with their new service. ====================::==================== Ahmed1000 said: ↑ nookfan said: ↑ I would much rather have a robust library of games that I can purchase and own, myself. Click to expand... It was nice on Wii and Wii U, but now? No thanks. I'll gladly pay a subscription service to have access to these games in bulk format, rather than buy them individually, all over again. Click to expand... I think this fails to take into account consumers beyond the core Nintendo fanbase. Switch has been a success and ideally, it will continue to appeal to new gamers, young gamers, and people who Nintendo lost over the last couple of generations. Wii U undersold and it has been 6 years since the end of the Wii era. That means there are likely a lot of Switch owners who never took advantage of the Virtual Console. There are definite advantages to being able to buy select classics and the fact that many of us (in the niche, core Nintendo fanbase) have done it before doesn't negate that. There are probably people who'd like to pay once to own Mario Kart 64 and be able to play it anywhere rather than having to pay a yearly fee to have access to a bunch of games that don't interest them. I think a subscription service and an online store can coexist. Sony has Playstation Now, but I'm pretty sure it also hosts games from older generations on the Playstation Store. Perhaps being subscribed to Nintendo's online service gives you occasional discounts on VC items.",,BIGBMH,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,I really hope Nintendo sticks with the new classic games format.,,,

While there isn't currently much to write home about in regards to Nintendo's Online service, I must say the way they have handled the classic games has been great, and something many fans had hoped Nintendo would do for a very long time. It's one clean app, and the games are offered to you in a Netflix style. I imagine (hope) they will do this for each console. One app per console as they continue to add more and more games to each console. Nice and organized. But if they bring the old format back, that would mean purchasing individual games...all over again. No thanks. Wii and Wii U was enough, I'm not doing that crap again. Not only is it messy to have hundreds of VC games littering your eShop, it's also very expensive. A Netflix style of delivery is much better for the consumer and actually adds value to the Online service in the long run. I hope this code is simply a reference to future apps they will be adding, the same way they rolled out the NES app. Here's hoping Nintendo doesn't screw up one of the few good things they have done with their new service. ====================::==================== Ahmed1000 said: ↑ nookfan said: ↑ I would much rather have a robust library of games that I can purchase and own, myself. Click to expand... It was nice on Wii and Wii U, but now? No thanks. I'll gladly pay a subscription service to have access to these games in bulk format, rather than buy them individually, all over again. Click to expand... I think this fails to take into account consumers beyond the core Nintendo fanbase. Switch has been a success and ideally, it will continue to appeal to new gamers, young gamers, and people who Nintendo lost over the last couple of generations. Wii U undersold and it has been 6 years since the end of the Wii era. That means there are likely a lot of Switch owners who never took advantage of the Virtual Console. There are definite advantages to being able to buy select classics and the fact that many of us (in the niche, core Nintendo fanbase) have done it before doesn't negate that. There are probably people who'd like to pay once to own Mario Kart 64 and be able to play it anywhere rather than having to pay a yearly fee to have access to a bunch of games that don't interest them. I think a subscription service and an online store can coexist. Sony has Playstation Now, but I'm pretty sure it also hosts games from older generations on the Playstation Store. Perhaps being subscribed to Nintendo's online service gives you occasional discounts on VC items.",,BIGBMH,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,I really hope Nintendo sticks with the new classic games format.,,,

The xbox has some advantages but Sony is still beating them in many other facets. Or they are both fairly comparable. The PS4 still has some really neat features that the Xbox still doesn't have. The annoucement yesterday about PlayStation Now allowing downloads was a big blow to what used to be a cool Xbox only feature except with streaming option on top. The PlayStation at this point has also become a better platform for multimedia (unless you care about plugging in your TV box to your Xbox which I believe the snap feature was removed anyways so you lose the multitasking). Microsoft really screwed the pooch went from having great console OS on the 360 compared to compeitors to have something worse. And when they do add something new and unique, Sony has been 1-uping them this generation.",,ijakinov,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

One thing Game Pass still is cheaper normally when PSNow isnt on sale and one thing Game pass does thats cool is put more recent games. Like they had Warhammer Vermintide 2 the same day it was released to consoles. Also a AAA game like Forza Horizon 4 is coming out the same day next month.

I did the 7-day trial and in general it worked well for me. In fact, I'm actually strongly considering the $99/12 months subscription offer (which equates to only $8.25/month), as it ends in a couple of days. However, I did decide to break out my smaller 720p TV screen to try out Red Dead Redemption, which is one of the games I'm interested in playing on the service. It certainly looked better there than it did on my 49"" 4K TV, upon which it looked abominable (it originally rendered at 640p on the PS3, apparently).",,ryanriver321,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

It's great they've been successful this gen because it only means that they will go full throttle for hardware, network and services and new IP's next gen, in the end, gamers win......... The Gaikai and Onlive purchases were genius, it's bearing fruit, PSNOW is evolving, the network infrastructure is evolving. I mean nobody talks about when Sony enhances things, go to the PC PSN store and tell me it's the same as it was 1 year ago, this thing is lightning fast, purchases take no less than a second, it's the fastest store I've used in a minute....Taking my monthly plus games used to take so much time, it was slow, but now, even ELON MUSK would be proud.. If you think Sony can compete against Cloud giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Then you’re wrong. It’s much more complex than buying 2 failing companies. If Sony were geniuses, then they should have competed against Azure, AWS, they should have known beforehand that Game will be streaming in the cloud and you need to be a cloud company to do so.

I've only played console games and like I said before I am very much so out of the loop on the new stuff. This might sound dumb but is there a way to connect a keyboard and mouse to a PlayStation? Now that I think about it I have played some pc games before but not having a controller was weird as fuck to me. I think I'm going to get one of those steering wheel controllers so I can at least play some racing games. Thank you for trying to help me.

PS3 did the same thing, in that it was not emulated, since their disk security method they used on PS1 and PS2 are not easy to emulate, and thus, it was easier to just shove an entire PS2 into the PS3. Both the PS2 and PS3 eventually got rid of backwards compatibility with console revisions(PS2 slim, PS3 slim) PS4 never had backwards compatibility, they never wanted it. I expect that it was a drive to try and encourage subs to their PSnow service, which hosts many older games online for you to *buy again*. Thats the drive, constant income. Its why I will never buy a console, because I know I can upgrade a part of my PC, and play both old games thru emulators(if needed), or directly, and also play brand new games as well. We on PC can also play games from consoles thanks to emulators too.",,chubbysumo,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Well, that will no longer be the case in at least some instances. Sony announced today that select titles from the PS4 and PS2 will now be able to be downloaded onto your console so that you can play games offline if needed. The description for this new feature says that “almost all” PS4 titles that are available through PlayStation Now will able to be downloaded alongside those PS2 titles that have been remastered for PS4. While there’s no price increase needed to download games in this manner, the only thing you are required to do is connect to the Internet once every few days so that the service can verify your subscription.",,sleepery jeem,United Kingdom,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Re: The PS4 Thread,,,

Currently, I have no tv cable at all, by choice, but I want to gear up to watch all the bb games, and I would also like to see some tv news, Netflix, and podcasts and other decent shows. I have Comcast for my computers. What kind of tv should I buy? Smart TV, or what are the other options to consider? Son-in-law says a Roku stick can get the games, but I want to do everything legally. Can I have a tv in a room away from my modem and have it connected wirelessly? Please explain this stuff so I can understand it. I'm quite tech savvy on most things, but not this. Thanks! ====================::==================== I just dropped my cable TV package and signed up for Direct TV Now. I don't know if they still have it, but they had a promo where you prepay for 4 months and get a free Apple TV. If they're not doing that deal any more, Rokus are great. I have 2 on other TVs. DirectTV Now has an app for all the popular devices. My package has the sports channels I wanted (ESPN channels, CBS Sports, Fox Sports) and you can authenticate with many of the apps if you also get the channels. For example, I'm watching a baseball game on the ESPN app right now on my iPad because I authenticateed with my DirecTV Now account. There are other services out there like YouTube TV, Sling TV, Playstation Now (which doesn't require a Playstation console). Look at the channels and pricing, and choose what's best for you. What's great about all of them is that there's no contracts.

Just abused the campsite and finished the game in 13 hours, now I am all caught up.

DirectTV Now has an app for all the popular devices. My package has the sports channels I wanted (ESPN channels, CBS Sports, Fox Sports) and you can authenticate with many of the apps if you also get the channels. For example, I'm watching a baseball game on the ESPN app right now on my iPad because I authenticateed with my DirecTV Now account. There are other services out there like YouTube TV, Sling TV, Playstation Now (which doesn't require a Playstation console). Look at the channels and pricing, and choose what's best for you.

The online let’s you spend really money! Meanwhile https://www.gamespot.com/articles/d...a/1100-6461972/ As long as they don't make the orbs awful to obtain and it's literally just a way for idiots to blow money, I don't see the problem. These big budget games (although let's get real, the backdrops in that trailer are loving laughable) are obviously trying to find more ways to bring in revenue to keep their studios afloat and to keep the dev cycle going. I don't blame them. However, all that poo poo goes out the window when it's some p2w type hook where it's either spend the money or sit on your thumb spinning for 40 hours. Obviously, that probably won't happen since this will be a fully priced game. Aside from that, I think RDR looks awesome. I didn't get a chance to play the others and I don't think theres a decent way to play those with just a PS4 and no xbone otherwise I'd be trying them right now.

I just think its a bonus to play games at launch to try out. Yeah its like a demo but with no restrictions like some demos. Besides many games dont have demos now anyways. But regardless thats not my main point. I guess I just think Id rather get a cheaper price with more recent games than 400+ older games. I'm honestly curious whats the most recent game released that is on PSNow? I dont think PSNow is a terrible deal I just prefer Xbox Game Pass right now.,,sakata32,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

You get gamepass for a year for the same price as psnow. $99. Difference is, you get a full copy of Forza 7 thrown in to keep forever. Oh, and Forza horizon 3 too. No idea why you'd want to commit to psnow for a year, so if you don't it's 20 bucks a month, whereas gamepass is 10. That's half price. It's way way better because gamepass has new games. Let me know when newly launched games release simultaneously on psnow. Then there's the online checks which you cows slammed ms for. Yup, you need to connect online every few days even if you're playing offline games. Gamepass lets you play them offline for as long as your subscription is valid. Where psnow will have a handful of games available to download, gamepass has 100. Psnow has ...and will never have... last gen titles available for download, gamepass has loads. Damn kid....

A game can't be added to BC without publishers approval, even then, it is technically still running as a Xbox 360 game so it doesn't void the contracts. That's why it's much easier to do play anywhere going forward than backward, because of the fresh contracts regarding royalties.

Sony has over twice the install base of Xbox and has no reason from a business perspective to do cross-play. I’m kinda tired of people acting like the Xbox is this super consumer friendly console when in reality they had one of the most anti-consumer and anti-gaming friendly policies planned and they paid an extreme price for it. Yeah, they offer a lot of incentives to get people on their system right now because 2 out of 3 people are gonna choose a PS4 and the switch is on track to outsell it by next year. Just wait till Pokémon 8 comes out. >thinking PSNow is a good service Yeah it’s not a good value. However they don’t have the technical wizards who were able to implement BC so that’s what they have for now. It’s better than nothing but not as good as BC. Of all the things the Xbox does, BC might be its saving grace. >limited cloud functionality What? >that also deletes your saves after 6 months Yeah they really shouldn’t delete the saves, but at the same time it’s taking up space on their servers. I might be wrong but they don’t have anything like Azure in their end. >the terribly organized UI You’re being petty. It’s universally agreed the PS4 UI is much quicker, smoother, and intuitive than the Xbox One’s. The One is quite a bit better than it used to be but if you don’t use it daily you have to hunt for whatever it is you need to do there. >its exclusives are the one and only thing it has going for it really Yeah and it’s the most important thing. Not only that but they have a lot of upcoming exclusives. What does the Xbox have? Crackdown 3? That game is going to be mediocre. There’s no way after so many delays it turns out good and I hate that. >there’s so many good games coming out that are not exclusives Red dead 2 is the only non-exclusive that will have the impact of stuff like god of war, spider man, smash brothers, Mario party, octopus that traveler, Detroit become human etc has. I play PUBG on Xbox more than anything right now, even more than pc because I can’t get enough of it. But the extra stuff is the only thing keeping the Xbox one afloat. If they didn’t have BC, the 4K blu-ray player, and maybe the one x they’d be dead in the water because there’s only so many forza games people can stomach",,WaidWilson,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Reddit,,,,,,,,

These big budget games (although let's get real, the backdrops in that trailer are loving laughable) are obviously trying to find more ways to bring in revenue to keep their studios afloat and to keep the dev cycle going. I don't blame them. However, all that poo poo goes out the window when it's some p2w type hook where it's either spend the money or sit on your thumb spinning for 40 hours. Obviously, that probably won't happen since this will be a fully priced game. Aside from that, I think RDR looks awesome. I didn't get a chance to play the others and I don't think theres a decent way to play those with just a PS4 and no xbone otherwise I'd be trying them right now.

The irony considering trophies are nothing but a meaningless collectable for your PSN account. Except when you link them to mysonyrewards.com and you get PSN currency for trophies earned. Can you go into detail? It's US only. Something like 10 platinums (or a larger amount of Gold or Silvers) gets a $10 code. It's a PITA to set up, but if you're playing games anyway then there's no reason not to. You have to sign up with a different email/pw to your Sony one, which is dumb, then you have to link the accounts, then you have to actually enable the trackers instead of being automatic. I just tried logging in for the first time in months to view my progress and it gave me a generic security question I had never set up then asked me to phone Sony. f***ers. I did, it only took 2 mins, but damn it's been set up by monkeys. Hm. I don't see myself earning more than 20-30 platinum trophies for the entirety of ps4's existence. I don't think it's what I need. Thank you very much for the explanation. I really appreciate your time. Looking now... you need 1000 points for a $10 code. Every 25 gold trophies gets 250 points, every 100 silver trophies gets 100 points, every 10 platinums gets 1000 points, other things gets points like subscribing to PSN services or doing trials of them, or renting 3 movies from PSN on PS4, and so on. I haven't done any movies or PSNow or any of that stuff, and just from trophies and buying games on PSN I've earned enough for a $10 card already. Checking my history, I have nearly 1000 points in the last year just from doing my typical game purchases on PSN, plus some from trophies put me well over 1000. I didn't even know they were doing that. That's an unexpected bonus.",,Sheepinator,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

When I buy NEW CONSOLE I want to play NEW GAMES. I would not sell my old console if I would like to play old crap. On top of that - It's not like Playstation does not work to get old games to new consoles. But they don't want to run emulators or put old console hardware into new box just for few retro gamers. So they started Playstation Now. That BTW - have more games that Microsoft emulator. And as they said recently - you will be able to download games onto the console and play them locally. Not all of them but still. While Microsoft at the same time spend a lot of time to adjust old games to new console INSTEAD of making new exclusive titles. So say what you want - even now if I would have to choose between playing old games on X1 or new games on PS4 - I would buy PS4.,,znudzony_programista,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

No company is perfect and they are likely working on it just like they have in the past. I only bought up Sony's PS4 since everyone likes to say ""Nintendo is so behind, they need to have everything at launch because the others currently support it"", without looking at facts. When other companies got away with years not having those same basic features on the current generation or putting them behind a paywall or shocker a paywall being the only method for a few years before giving it to people. Is it wrong? Sure but if you wanted to show you don't support their methods, you shouldn't have purchased a Switch, you should be putting your money where your mouth is and hit them in their wallets. Many YouTubers complained about the Online in general yet day one they were talking about how it isn't that bad and that it works as intended right out the gate. People may complain and say they should be doing X while they are still buying products and allowing them to take their time. Not to beat a dead horse but even the PS4, a console that should be perfect in every way considering its success yet basic things like backward compatibility and cross play aren't supported. Playing older games are behind a new paywall with PSNow or requiring you to repurchase for more money (FF9 is $10 with crossbuy on PS3/PSP/Vita yet is $21 on PS4). The PS4 can easily handle software emulation for at least PS1 and PS2 yet not there. Just saying not every company is perfect but the basics will slowly be pushed out if people keep demanding it. Sadly I really feel like the cloud saving is cheap enough and will hold enough people that people won't complain anymore about having no local backups.",,LegendAssassin,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

It used to be on Playstation Now (the streaming service that's on PS4/PC), but it was removed for some reason (I've heard it was related to the lack of pressure sensitive buttons on PS4 but I dunno if it was confirmed). There's a PS3 emulator with a few games that are well playable, but it'll be a very long time before MGS4 reaches anywhere near that state. Currently the only option is either get a PS3 or hope a remaster/port is announced.",,mintorment,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Even if the emulator could boot 80% of the games (and the one on PS3 was way less compatible IIRC), we can expect at least a fourth of those games to encounter a critical error that will lead to crashing, and another big percentage will have compatibility problems/bugs/glitches or major performance issues. So if Sony allowed us to play PS2 games just like that from our own discs, people would eventually realize that every 5th game they try wont even boot, a noticeable percentage will have critical errors and crashes, and many others will have a gallery of bugs and technical issues. Sony would eventually catch bad press for ""half assed attempt at backwards compatibility"", people would be upset and Sony would need to pump more money into development, which may not return enough profit on the long run. Considering they need to ensure that every classic game they sell in the store need to have a trophy support, and the games also require a certain degree of quality assurance, they couldn't pump out enough quality releases for sale. So basically its about the optics. They cant lose if they are not even playing the backwards compatibility game. But Im sure there are also a ton of minor technical settings that need to be adjusted for each game separately, which wouldn't fly with your average consumer. On PC, its way easier to set up a PS1 emulator by yourself and not fuck things up royally, but so many people are lost when they set the PS2 emulator for the first time. Doesn't help that there are so many ""performance configs"" made by technically incompetent people around the internet, that get copy pasted around and screw up the emu settings even worse. To be clear, I dont believe the emulator on PS4 can even play 60% of the games from start to finish, and I think the emulator might require more technical attention when a game is being ran on it. Since PS4 has multiple low performance CPU cores, they must have come up with some configurable way of allocating the CPU cores per game basis. I dont know what that requires, but Im guessing they need to do some behind the scenes tweaking for each individual game, and do additional game testing to get optimal game performance. The way Sony should have handled PS2 BC should have been by making the emulator a service or app that you can purchase. That way they could have a more steady stream of money, and could make it clear of the emulator is not finished and will eventually receive compatibility updates. Alternatively they could have now merged this emulator into PSNow as a service, instead of just including the PS2 Classics.",,Thewonderboy94,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Xbox has the better backwards compatibility options for playing older games. Playstation Now just recently allows you to download select games. Both consoles are made for 4K screens. The One X is native 4K on most titles (not all) and the PS4 Pro is native on a few titles, the rest use a technique to expand a resolution higher than 1080p onto a 4K screen so it doesn't look blurry. Every console this generation supports 60hz, it's up to the developer of a game to make it run at 60fps. Between One X and Pro they both run games mostly the same as the base PS4 and base Xbox One hold them back because of parity. Both consoles have lots of apps to use besides gaming, the edge Xbox has is a 4K Bluray player but that only matters if you're someone who buys 4K blurays in this age. If you watch movies digital then the Pro is still capable. You buy a gaming console for different things but the bottom line is - games. This generation has shown me PlayStation has completely destroyed Xbox in terms of better and more games. If you have a Windows 10 PC with a GPU then you don't even need an Xbox because 98% of Xbox exclusives are on PC and you don't need to pay for online. Xbox has continuously delayed and cancelled big games. They don't seem to have a solid plan in believing in great single player games. This E3 they seemed to show some care for it now but the games won't see light until the next generation Xbox in 2020. Sony on the other hand has continuously funded amazing games: God of War, Bloodborne, Horizon Zero Dawn, Spider-Man, Ratchet & Clank, The Last Guardian, Uncharted 4 to name a few. They even get fantastic incidental Japanese exclusives like Persona5, Yakuza and FFXIV because Xbox is basically non-existent in Japan. They let developers do what they want and it pays off. For me I care more about the quality of games than 4K resolution. Xbox has had bad exclusives since the end of 2016. Sea of Thieves was a huge disappointment, State of Decay and PUBG are a mess when it comes to performance. Halo and Gears are irrelevant at this point. The only really consistent exclusive they have is Forza but they put a new one out every year like it's Call of Duty.",,Rzx5,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Remember when Microsoft themselves said : ""Backward Compatibility is backward thinking..."" Remember when BC wasnt even a thing for nearly 3 fokin years (2013 - 2016 i believe?). You wanna know something? Give your thanks to Sony for beating the living crap out of the greedy fucks at Redmond. Without them burning so much ... there would not be any Play Anywhere Initiative nor any Backward Compat. The hypocrisy coming frrom the redmond corner and fans this gen. is mindboggling. There was no outrage AT ALL when they dropped the VR support for the 6Teraflops XBX. Nothing .. not once got Microsoft shat on for misleading. For most of you it is time to recap how crap/greed the redmonder were this gen. Thanks to Sony PC folks get to play the somewhat ""ok"" MS ips ... thanks to Sony they were forced to add BC (because lets be honest, their last IP exclusive has to be Qbreak which flopped). Cross Play was a thing since 2001 on PlayStation. Sony supports or has supported their OWN VR device .. .a compnay like Sony which is like a 1/10 of what Microsoft can output ... delivers on every front - new devices (own, VR or handheld) - new software/games - PSVue - PSNow 5 years of non stop support, yet all the get is this outrage from the green corner.

Click to expand... It was nice on Wii and Wii U, but now? No thanks. I'll gladly pay a subscription service to have access to these games in bulk format, rather than buy them individually, all over again. Click to expand... I think this fails to take into account consumers beyond the core Nintendo fanbase. Switch has been a success and ideally, it will continue to appeal to new gamers, young gamers, and people who Nintendo lost over the last couple of generations. Wii U undersold and it has been 6 years since the end of the Wii era. That means there are likely a lot of Switch owners who never took advantage of the Virtual Console. There are definite advantages to being able to buy select classics and the fact that many of us (in the niche, core Nintendo fanbase) have done it before doesn't negate that. There are probably people who'd like to pay once to own Mario Kart 64 and be able to play it anywhere rather than having to pay a yearly fee to have access to a bunch of games that don't interest them. I think a subscription service and an online store can coexist. Sony has Playstation Now, but I'm pretty sure it also hosts games from older generations on the Playstation Store. Perhaps being subscribed to Nintendo's online service gives you occasional discounts on VC items.",,BIGBMH,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

It looks awesome! I want to get that but I also want other PS4 exclusives like Persona 5, God of War, Uncharted 4 and etc. However, I don’t have enough space in my room to place a PS4 console nor can I place it my living room because that’s where my dad watches TV. A while ago when I wanted Jojo Eyes of Heaven (even though they don’t have it) I came across”PlayStation Now”. However, my allowance wouldn’t cover a Netflix-style gaming service so I just sighed and went back to playing on my Xbox and stuff. But when I was looking at PlayStation Now again and I found that now you can download games! However, I don’t know what they mean by “download”. Do they mean downloaded on your computer or what? Do i need to sign in and get a membership like Netflix to get and play a game I want or can I just buy and download it?

It's not as if they have to build their own infrastructure from scratch, they can just host off of aws, google cloud or azure. Yep, although it could be a tricky situation if the big 3 are running their own native services and can have a larger margin than Sony. It's not an ideal situation when your main competitors are also the platform owner of the infrastructure you are using. It may well mean that we see a bit more diversity in gaming going forward where there are bigger differences in the products on offer. Currently you have mobile and Nintendo doing different things while MS and Sony are doing pretty much the same. In the future we may see MS and Sony going down distinctly different paths, there are already signs of that starting to happen now.",,CeeJay,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

But I don't see anywhere NEAR the amount of blowback against Sony for this. Why? Because it honestly does not matter in the slightest, but because it's Nintendo and online people want to latch onto ANYTHING to hate on the service.

But planetside has been getting worse on PlayStation since the beta. After the release of 2 on PC my TR heart was broken i stayed away from it. Then apon release of playstation i decided a game this size could do well. So i picked up a controller for the first time since halo 1 and got stuck in formed a outfit and sang songs of planetside 1 and the possibility of large scale eternal war. If i came in to planetside 2 on PlayStation now for the first time today. I'd be pretty upset. Sony are very careful about what gets added to there systems.

The sand in the game actually helped me measure the latency I get with the service. From what I saw the latency isnt terrible at all for me but its clear that there is some. Not the most ideal way to play games but for some games its not a big deal like with journey. Hopefully streaming can get better in the next few years where the latency not very noticeable to the naked eye. As for the game itself I actually really enjoyed it. I loved the art and music. And overall thought it was a very relaxing/chill game. Gameplay was ok for me but I wouldnt say it was doing anything innovative or even good (besides the multiplayer aspect). But it was simple and I guess thats what made the game relaxing/chill for me. No complicated systems I have to worry about. But to me what made this game a ton of fun was actually the way they incorporated multiplayer coop in this game. It was cool just having a random dude you dont know following you and just leading the way or helping each other out. It was also hilarious to see the partner mess up. It was oddly wholesome seeing someone follow you or waiting for the other person to catch up. I can see that the game isnt for everyone but since its so short (2 hoursish) its a game worth trying if you want a relaxing experience. I wouldnt say its a great game cause I think the gameplay is still a little lacking but a good experience for sure.,,sakata32,United States of America,,,Neutral,Joy,Reddit,,,,,,,,

My internet isn't the greatest but i was still able to stream the 8 year old game easily enough. The whole narrative in RDR1 is explained through offhand dialogue throughout the entire game, alluding to John's background of him being in a gang. I wouldn't recommend a certain video because there are just SO MANY little details in the first one regarding John in the past. Like even some of the conversations John has on the side while riding on a horse with someone else has details wrapped in mystery. The best way would to be watch one of the five hour cutscene collections on youtube. Other than that, and preferably, you should play through it on PSnow if its possible.

The connection never timed out and the resolution never dropped below 720p. If there was serious input lag, I didn't notice it; activities like duels and breaking horses which require quick timing were pretty easy.

It is as if it is ignoring the gamepad during gameplay although it works in the PSnow interface. I remember playing on PSnow last year and not having the issue, where as now, the gamepad would work when i first initiate and play a game and when i finish, minimize or exit the application to return later gameplay would completely ignore gamepad. This is quite unpleasant as it means i have to restart the PC every time I want to game on PSnow. Anyone offer a solution to this please.

I left my opinion out of that statement when I typed it (hit the nail on the head though) Whats stopping you for going out an picking up a PS3 and the games you want? You're only looking at a few hundred dollars (unless you want _everything_) That way you're not attached to a goddamn subscription service for $10/month or $100/year _and_ you can come back to the games at any time. There's no rushing to finish it before the subscription ends or if you put it down/get busy for 6 months and get a hankering later you can pick it back up and continue where you left off. Can't do that with PSNow, you'd have to redownload it, work your way through the game again, _and_ pay for it again. Imagine being a parent with only 1 - 2 hours of free time a day to play games. With this subscription you'd be looking at 3x as much money for a PS3 game or roughly 5x for a PS2 game. Alternatively you could spend between $10 - $30 to buy the game outright and you own it forever, no reoccurring fees, no deleted saves if you're away for 6 or more months.",,A_Wild_VelociFaptor,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

However, this has been one of my top 5 hidden gems of the year. It's a point and click interactive with quick time events, investigations, passive interrogations, and puzzles. All of those things mixed together by themselves would have been good enough for me, but it goes one step by further with surprisingly rather detailed environments and an intriguing little story. Trophies weren't hard at all yet this game somehow sits at a 9% completion rate. Just figured I'd let you know if you were considering playing but hadn't for whatever reason. It's worth it and is currently on playstation now for anyone who might have a subscription. ====================::==================== 1 minute ago, Han_the_Dragon said: If you liked this, then play the 2nd game, I remember it being as good as the 1st one (but I played it around the release, so it was a long time ago..).

These big budget games (although let's get real, the backdrops in that trailer are loving laughable) are obviously trying to find more ways to bring in revenue to keep their studios afloat and to keep the dev cycle going. I don't blame them. However, all that poo poo goes out the window when it's some p2w type hook where it's either spend the money or sit on your thumb spinning for 40 hours. Obviously, that probably won't happen since this will be a fully priced game. Aside from that, I think RDR looks awesome. I didn't get a chance to play the others and I don't think theres a decent way to play those with just a PS4 and no xbone otherwise I'd be trying them right now.

PS3/Vita with Vita being the marginally superior version, so it may be a pain to play depending on what you have. I'd basically just recommend checking a guide in Ayesha whenever you feel like you're spinning your wheels, rather than continuing to let them spin like I did. The modern ones are much better about that kind of stuff. I'd say Lydie & Suelle (the most recent one) has better gameplay but is worse on story/writing/characters/music.

Sony can do whatever the hell they want to create money, it's called business! Get over it fanboys. 2. PSNow is NOT BC. It's a rental service. You idiots need to stop trying to push that argument because Games Pass only has 1/3 of the games offered on PSNow and is also mostly filled with OLD games. So if PSNow is BC, Games Pass is also BC only with anemic selection to choose from. 3. All sony fans aren't the same.

The CPU on the PS3 was hard to program for, hence why third party games ran worse on PS3 then on Xbox360 and why first party titles looked amazing for their time (TLOU for example). The Cell Processor is actually more powerful then the PS4 CPU. Emulating another console requires your CPU to keep transpiling the game for it to run on PS4, but the PS4 CPU would need all it’s power for the game already. That’s why you’ll never get PS3 backwards compat. Even PlayStation Now which is the streaming service just allowed downloading PS2, PS4 games instead of streaming, but not PS3. And guess how they are streaming PS3 games? By using actual PS3s to run the game you want to stream because another way is impossible. Sony tried PS2 backwards compatibility on the launch PS3 but it made the system way too expensive and they dropped it to make a cheaper PS3. Not sure why they haven’t revisited that idea though.",,Shinoken__,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Just so you know PlayStation Now is not available in India. Xbox Game Pass however is. For casual gamers or those who have a long backlog I would highly recommend Xbox Game Pass as there are plenty of great games and new ones are coming each month. It do however require that you download large amounts of data. Xbox have by far the larges library of previous console-gen games you can play. You can buy or use old X360 disc. But it's just a verification that you own the game as the entire game will be downloaded. Both the PS4Pro and XboxOneX support 4K 60Hz. But the X is by far the more powerful console and will hit 4K or close to much more often then the Pro. With performance the difference is not as dramatic but the X is the more powerful console in all ways. XboxOne have a much larger app support then PS4. But what type of applications that's available varies from region to region. The Xbox One X is more powerful and will take better advantage of a 4K TV or monitor. It also have support for Free-Sync. So if you get a screen that supports that you will get a far better experience. It also have Dolby Atmos support either via a full surround setup or by software by Dolby that you can purchase on the Xbox for use with headphones. It is with some games fantastic. You also have a large selection of older games to play and in India the option to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass for access to over hundred games old and new. With new games coming each month. Fantastic value. PlayStation have some fantastic exclusive games. If you know about them then you need to think about what's most important to you. If you dont know about them then you should look it up. Personally if I had to chose I honestly would have a hard time picking one. The X delivers the best looking games and access to a large library of old games. Some X enhanced like Red Dead Redemption in 4K. Meanwhile PlayStation have some of the best games. Ever. Made. Good luck...and remember that a new console generation starts in about 2 years...,,_LarZen_,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

That's why I didn't mention PS3, and only hope for more PS2/PS4 and hopefully PS1. The total number of games in the gamepass may be lower but they can all be downloaded as well as benefit from enhanced performance unlike the PS3 games which are stuck at how they originally were, as well as the limitations of streaming. I wouldn't even be surprised if the number of downloadable games with PSNow is currently less than GamePass because not all PS4 games on PSNow will be available to download yet. All this while paying double. Of course, I understand your point, if we include streaming the selection is definitely larger.

You can fully download games and play them as much as you want for only $9.99/month. The only requirement is that the game has to be available on Game Pass when you play the game. Meaning that games can be withdrawn and added from time to time. Which is reasonable. It's pretty much like a digital renting service, similar to how you could rent physical games back in the old days. The library is pretty good too, with a few AAA games that is being sold in the digital store for close to the full release price, but with Game Pass you can play those games for only $9.99/month and easily finish one or two games in less than a month. You can save a lot of money with this service as long as there is at least one game in the Game Pass library that you want to play during your membership. You can also cancel and subscribe to the service whenever you want to do that. I just hope that they keep adding a lot more games in the future. More from third party developers. I can see how this could potentially be a highly profitable service for Microsoft. What are your thoughts about the service? ====================::==================== Cyberfiction said: ↑ It gets a lot better if you compare it to something like PlayStation Now. PlayStation Now: $19.99/month. Streaming instead of real backwards compatibility. Only PS4 games can be downloaded to local storage. PS3 games has to be streamed. Game Pass: $9.99/month. Full backwards compatibility. No restrictions. Click to expand... If you're worried about value PSNow is $99 for a year (less than 10 a month).

You can fully download games and play them as much as you want for only $9.99/month. The only requirement is that the game has to be available on Game Pass when you play the game. Meaning that games can be withdrawn and added from time to time. Which is reasonable. It's pretty much like a digital renting service, similar to how you could rent physical games back in the old days. The library is pretty good too, with a few AAA games that is being sold in the digital store for close to the full release price, but with Game Pass you can play those games for only $9.99/month and easily finish one or two games in less than a month. You can save a lot of money with this service as long as there is at least one game in the Game Pass library that you want to play during your membership. You can also cancel and subscribe to the service whenever you want to do that. I just hope that they keep adding a lot more games in the future. More from third party developers. I can see how this could potentially be a highly profitable service for Microsoft. What are your thoughts about the service? ====================::==================== Cyberfiction said: ↑ It gets a lot better if you compare it to something like PlayStation Now. PlayStation Now: $19.99/month. Streaming instead of real backwards compatibility. Only PS4 games can be downloaded to local storage. PS3 games has to be streamed. Game Pass: $9.99/month. Full backwards compatibility. No restrictions. Click to expand... If you're worried about value PSNow is $99 for a year (less than 10 a month). And you can now download the PS2 and PS4 games.",,supersoulfly,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Game Pass - Best Gaming Service?,,,

There was a PSN network error for about half a day years ago where the Vita was able to buy, download, & use what was the entire PS1 & PSP library that they had on PSN, but no they need it to be limited. And kept limiting it with the firmware updates which would remove compatible games & other services (like PSNow) from the already short list of Vita compatible titles & software, then whine people stopped buying it while they were limiting access to half the s*** it can actually access. PS3/PS4 PSN's are different though thats why they cant just transfer your data from one to the other.",,Flare1721,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Admittedly, I looked to trade for a profit. But who doesn't look for good deals? I never spent a dime on that game. Got the game during a free promotion and never bought 1 key. I ended up switching to PC later on and lost access to a Playstation. Now my account worth a little over a hundred dollars is sitting unused. ​ I said all that because PC trading has been a complete nightmare. Price sheets are brought up in every other sentence someone writes. There is no more fun to this. It's all luck.

They bought because no one wanted to buy it.... @howmakewood maybe they just go to IBM/Oracle? Highly doubt theyll build their own No because Sony is probably scaredthat all other major players will want to join the race. No your'e talking out your ass. How dose how you personally feel about Sony's actions = a Fact? Just stop. YOU'RE the one acting like you have all the inside info on Sony's cloud business...so why don't you tell us all in detail exactly what Sony has, is working on now and what it is capable of? The problem is you don't know shit but you're talking like you have information which we don't. Again...Tell us all what Sony is working on since apparently you already know the ins and outs of their current operation! I'm merely stating logic an the obvious, the fact that Sony is only thinking about Cloud now after 10 years after other players and even later than IBM and Oracle, it's bound to be much worse than say even Oracle's or IBM's Cloud platform. It's just now that Sony is now realising that the Cloud market is seeping into the Gaming industry. So...you actually don't know shit then, just dreaming up baseless speculation about things you have no idea about? You dismissed the fact that Sony purchased Onlive and Gaikai and want to try to argue about what they aren't prepared for...yet those purchases were made years ago and have already been put to use. PSNow for example. Other than shit we already know...what can YOU tell us about Sonys current operations with the cloud? In detial? I'm not asking for what you think is ""logic"" I'm asking for FACTS that can valid any of the BS you're spewing in this thread for something that Sony hasn't fully revealed to the public yet? YOU CAN'T! You're a complete idiot if you don't think Sony can provide a competent cloud service on par with MS, Again Sony is a TECHNOLOGY based company. Stop being stupid, if Sony can't produce a competent solution for the cloud that rivals the competition, then they wont bother releasing one. Or it could be an attempt to not be dependant on Google, Amazon or Microsoft when it's very likely that those 3 companies are going to get into the Cloud gaming market.",,Daniel_Su123,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,M,,,,,,,

I love Kiwami 2, and for some reason I can't explain, it's giving me some weird Parasite Eve vibes. I think maybe because of the way the battles start, or the interiors? I dunno, that's not the point. ​ Regardless, it's rekindled my love for these action/adventure games with their crazy, over-the-top stories and weird supernatural things going on. (I know Yakuza isn't supernatural, but Kiryu is punching guys 20 feet through walls now, it's pretty borderline supernatural.) I wanna know what I've missed, and what you all think would be a good fit for me to play. I've already got the new God of War and plan on playing that next, and other people have stressed the new Persona, though I'm not too into JRPGs anymore, so I'm not sure if I'll like that one. ​ So what would you all suggest for someone who loves these crazy, borderline ridiculous, supernatural stories? If it's on PSnow, that makes it a lot easier. It doesn't have to be modern era, that just seems to make the supernatural stuff more interesting to me. If it made it to PC, I probably played it, like The Evil Within or Resident Evil. ​ Man, as usual, I reread my post and it looks like all I did was ramble.

I know you said you don't have a PS3, but I'm virtually positive you can play it on Playstation Now through either your PS4 or your PC. Don't listen to the vitriolic people. Overall the game was received very well, and the people who dislike it usually have some strange obsession with how the combat was ""too easy"" or something, or they started the series with 0 and Kiwami and they can't tolerate the game not having 60fps.",,thespicywaffle,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

No credit cards or debit cards. I would buy a steam gift card but there are no local game stores that sell them. Its allways just Playstation. Now that I think about it, I regret claiming in the post that I am poor when im not. Theres just no way for me to buy the game. And if you ask why I have Cs:go and other games that cost money, Its becouse I am sharing a account with my friends account. He lives in Germany now. But I dont want the game anymore. I figured out that I should just be happy with what I have. If you have a phone (which I'm sure you do) you can use paysafecard very easily to purchase games on steam. Beside that why would you not get a card rather than asking people to use theirs to buy you a game? Just wondering. I was actually begging for the free copy which comes with the game.

I know some people say that you shouldn't bring a console to university because it's anti social or it could get stolen but I'll be staying in a studio flat by myself so if I have one I don't think someone will steal it. Another issue is space so I thought maybe I should use Playstation now to stream PS3 games to my laptop for convince but it costs £13 a month which might not be a good investment since money will be needed for other things at university or should i get a Nintendo switch because it's portable and saves space. 🤔 Also maybe this is a weird question but if I do choose to buy a console is carrying it from university to home & back in a duffle bag a good idea, would that keep it safe ?

I live a cash based life. No credit cards or debit cards. I would buy a steam gift card but there are no local game stores that sell them. Its allways just Playstation. Now that I think about it, I regret claiming in the post that I am poor when im not. Theres just no way for me to buy the game. And if you ask why I have Cs:go and other games that cost money, Its becouse I am sharing a account with my friends account. He lives in Germany now. But I dont want the game anymore. I figured out that I should just be happy with what I have. If you have a phone (which I'm sure you do) you can use paysafecard very easily to purchase games on steam. Beside that why would you not get a card rather than asking people to use theirs to buy you a game?

They rolled the service out in UK and most of Western Europe (oddly skipping the Republic of Ireland) and then just sort of stopped. The lack of a definitive list of which countries PSNow is and is not available in was never really published either.

I think you're underestimating how big of a profit they make off of controllers, cables, power adapters, memory cards and so on. Also how ridiculously profitable services like PSN and XBL are for their respective companies. Owning the hardware means they control everything about it, they have a mostly stable set of devices they can develop for, without worrying about the thousands of different configurations that can happen on PC. If they openly license and sell an emulator, it means they also have to provide support for it, which gets more and more expensive the more hardware configs you support. Sony works around this with their Playstation Now service, but they also rely on a constant and stable connection on the client side, which brings up a set of problems on its own. It's often difficult to just open and play a game, and there's almost always queues involved.",,freddy_francesco,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,M,,,,,,,

The main crawl for me is that one day online services are free, the next theyre not. They absolutely put up a paywall in the middle of their community, and its not hard to see why people feel theyve been locked out of a portion of a product they already paid for. Its further complicated by inconsistencies on Nintendos part- free to play games, like Fortnite and Paladins, do not require this subscription- but games you paid full price on, like Mario Kart and Splatoon 2, require you to pay even more. Why does a free game include free online, but a game that you paid 80$ + for not include any? And i get it- these services cost money, so they pass it onto you- but part of these games experiences IS the online gaming. Im sure Battlefeild costs EA in servers- but they accept these losses to better foster their community. And thats not even touching on third party games- why do i need a subscription to play Rocket League on -Rocket Leagues- servers? This isnt paying for nintendos server costs, or even Rocket Leagues server costs. Its just nintendo collecting money for moneys sake. Minecraft is even worse- you can literally pay Microsoft to create an exclusive world on Microsoft servers for you and your friends- but you need to pay Nintendo to activate your wifi? The Xbox live system and Playstation Network offer you free, relevant games for your online account. I never feel like im not getting my moneys worth, because they keep handing me free games, like metal gear solid 5, xcom 2, Destiny, ect- it costs 60 bucks a year, yes, but the return is far more- while nintendo is giving me a mere 22 games, all 30 year old or more. If Sony stopped giving me AAA titles, and instead gave me Atari 2600 titles, i might feel ripped off too My other gripes are just personal preferences; i frankly dont see any value in the cloud save. I have zero interest in it, but here i am expected to pay for it. Same with the NES streaming service. Its easily compared to PSNow- but while you get 100s of titles from PSNow, with numerous AAA experiences and almost all from the last 5 years, you get only 22 games from Nintendo, all decades old and none i would pay for on my own. Theyre planning to add like 7 more this year. Thats miserable. They couldve added half their NES library, easily, but didnt. I know what people will say- ""its only 20 bucks""- but thats not the point. Theyre taking away functionality from my console, putting in a paywall, and offering me products i dont value in exchange. Its like if Mcdonalds would sell a burger -only- if you bought fries, and people who didnt order fries were refused from getting burgers -and acted like theyre doing you a service by reducing your options. Its just.....disappointing. And i cant tell if it was an shameless cash grab, or just extremely poorly thought out and implemented. They need to do alot better.",,Jiperly,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I get Mighty Number 9 was a disappointment, but it's not representative at all of the quality of Inti Creates's work. There was a messed up situation with that Kickstarter. Mighty Gunvolt Burst and the Azure Striker Gunvolt pack are both excellent MM style platformers (more X than OG Mega Man), and the Mega Man Z series they made for Capcom was incredible (unfortunately, this series isn't on Switch... yet). They also have a few others that aren't MM style - Blaster Master Zero is a great remake of a classic NES ""proto-metroidvania"", it released a few months after Metroid and features some of the same design features. Curse of the Moon is a really well done classicvania. And well, there's also Gal\*Gun 2, which is a... weird... on-rails shooter.

However, this has been one of my top 5 hidden gems of the year. It's a point and click interactive with quick time events, investigations, passive interrogations, and puzzles. All of those things mixed together by themselves would have been good enough for me, but it goes one step by further with surprisingly rather detailed environments and an intriguing little story. Trophies weren't hard at all yet this game somehow sits at a 9% completion rate. Just figured I'd let you know if you were considering playing but hadn't for whatever reason. It's worth it and is currently on playstation now for anyone who might have a subscription. ====================::==================== Yes, it's names Red Johnson'Chronicles: One Against All, it's a different story (continuation from the 1st one, I think, but it been so long that I don't remember much and what I remember, I'm not sure if it's from the 1st or the 2nd, probably is just from the 2nd). The main thing that I remember is that there were more QTE sections, but it's build mainly using the same style as the 1st one.

You can fully download games and play them as much as you want for only $9.99/month. The only requirement is that the game has to be available on Game Pass when you play the game. Meaning that games can be withdrawn and added from time to time. Which is reasonable. It's pretty much like a digital renting service, similar to how you could rent physical games back in the old days. The library is pretty good too, with a few AAA games that is being sold in the digital store for close to the full release price, but with Game Pass you can play those games for only $9.99/month and easily finish one or two games in less than a month. You can save a lot of money with this service as long as there is at least one game in the Game Pass library that you want to play during your membership. You can also cancel and subscribe to the service whenever you want to do that. I just hope that they keep adding a lot more games in the future. More from third party developers. I can see how this could potentially be a highly profitable service for Microsoft. What are your thoughts about the service? ====================::==================== supersoulfly said: ↑ It's okay. Click to expand... It gets a lot better if you compare it to something like PlayStation Now. PlayStation Now: $19.99/month. Streaming instead of real backwards compatibility.

The problem is you don't know shit but you're talking like you have information which we don't. Again...Tell us all what Sony is working on since apparently you already know the ins and outs of their current operation! I'm merely stating logic an the obvious, the fact that Sony is only thinking about Cloud now after 10 years after other players and even later than IBM and Oracle, it's bound to be much worse than say even Oracle's or IBM's Cloud platform. It's just now that Sony is now realising that the Cloud market is seeping into the Gaming industry. So...you actually don't know shit then, just dreaming up baseless speculation about things you have no idea about? You dismissed the fact that Sony purchased Onlive and Gaikai and want to try to argue about what they aren't prepared for...yet those purchases were made years ago and have already been put to use. PSNow for example. Other than shit we already know...what can YOU tell us about Sonys current operations with the cloud? In detial? I'm not asking for what you think is ""logic"" I'm asking for FACTS that can valid any of the BS you're spewing in this thread for something that Sony hasn't fully revealed to the public yet? YOU CAN'T! You're a complete idiot if you don't think Sony can provide a competent cloud service on par with MS, Again Sony is a TECHNOLOGY based company.

I played this last week on €1.00 spins and lost €200.00 in less than 40 minutes. Not bought any bonuses as I find this a bull sh*t feature that should not be legal, but that's another story. In the 200 Euro I did not trigger a single bonus organically. Had a few times the genie popped up for a mini bonus but biggest hit on that was 44x. RTP for that session at Videoslots, a whopping 45.85%, I just checked it. Everything with BTG in the credits and where BTG has any influence on seems designed to just incur mega losses.

You get gamepass for a year for the same price as psnow. $99. Difference is, you get a full copy of Forza 7 thrown in to keep forever. Oh, and Forza horizon 3 too. No idea why you'd want to commit to psnow for a year, so if you don't it's 20 bucks a month, whereas gamepass is 10. That's half price. It's way way better because gamepass has new games. Let me know when newly launched games release simultaneously on psnow. Then there's the online checks which you cows slammed ms for. Yup, you need to connect online every few days even if you're playing offline games. Gamepass lets you play them offline for as long as your subscription is valid. Where psnow will have a handful of games available to download, gamepass has 100. Psnow has ...and will never have... last gen titles available for download, gamepass has loads. Damn kid.... Rekt.

Just over one month to go until Red Dead 2 comes out. And I wanted a cost effective yet good experience for RDR1 to hang me over. I will give you the pros and cons of each- it's pretty balanced! I need your definite answer, but this may help others in the situation. ​ **PSNOW** ​ **PROS** * £7.99 a month, plus a week trial will keep me going until RDR2 * I have a PS4PRO and a laptop and a PC, so I will be able to hop onto RDR on any of those devices in my house. * I have good internet, so I should have no issues streaming. **CONS** * RDR is the only game I would play with NOW. I have a PC for most old games and exclusives like The Last of Us I have the remasters of. * 540P resolution doesn't hold up as well against 720p Xbox. * It is streaming; always has hiccups and such which you would not experience as much if game is owned. ​ **XBOX 360** ​ **PROS** * Cheap; £50ish? * I have RDR purchased on my xbox account from when I had a one before PC gaming * HD 720p, stabler than PS3 * I already have cloud saved progress up to blackwater. I have lots of achievements to hunt to keep me going rather than the whole story again. * Can also pick up games such as Skate3 **CONS** * RDR is the only interest I have really. * £50 can be spent on most of the preorder of 2. * 2 is close, wont want to play RDR1 again after release maybe? * Cannot stream to PC/laptop.

Fable is rumored to be coming back Forza, Sea of Thieves State of Decay and more. It's unfair to say Microsoft has no exclusives, they just don't have as many single player exclusives. They are also cooling it with exclusives because it's bad business, and this gen they focused on Backwards compatibility, (I'm very happy with that. PSNow is awful compared to BC.) cross-play, making Windows and Xbox more compatible with things such as play anywhere, and 4K. Oh and supporting mods. Am I interested in some of Sony's exclusives, sure, but Xbox outweighs Sony in other areas for me, and I'd much rather have backwards compatibility than Microsoft focus everything on exclusives. We need new exclusives, sure, but it doesn't really help the consumer in the first place. They'd make more money by selling to everyone rather than only the people on their system.

Xbox games are backwards compatible with the One in a list that grows every week. Say, why did Sony choose to sell you the classics again instead of making them backwards compatible free of charge? Not bc at all. And it's free of charge cause MS is getting the s*** kicked out of them in sales and are trying to make the system more appealing. If they were in first place you bet your ass youd be paying for them or it wouldn't exist at all. Also it's not free of charge technically anyway as you need to buy said games for it to work. Mean while psnow you dont need to own the games not have owned them at anytime and pay for either a month, 3 months, or a year and you get 700+ games. You do realize that makes each game worth less than a quarter right? Last time I checked I cant buy a x360 game for 25 cents.",,densetsu86,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Once you have played Bloodbourne, Dark Souls, the Bioshocks, Uncharted games (if you already haven't), the Batman series, The Last of us and maybe God of War series most of everything else pretty much sucks. I keep coming back to try new games and get into them for about an hour and never play them again. Some of them may have been good in PS3's heyday but they just haven't aged well.

If you can download the PS2 games, then doesn't that mean it's emulating them on the system itself? Why can't you play your PS2 disks in the system then? Because then what would be the point of PSNow or buying PS2 classics? Sony doesn’t want to implement backward compatibility. They just want you to spend money. I mean, I would LOVE for there to be actual backwards compatibility on the PS4, but there's clearly use of PSNow other than playing PS2 games considering there's a metric ton more PS4 games available for it than PS2. Backwards compatibility is really not what this service is meant for.",,VigilantSteve,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

From the beginning, until now, there are still issues with the PC client that need addressing badly. I'm actually pretty certain that since the launch of this service, the PC client has never received a single update. 1. The infamous ""white screen"". The client goes white when it has been idle too long, or after players have been in-game too long, and then it needs a restart. 2. The infinite restart loop. This is usually fixed by turning off graphic acceleration, but why should we have to? 3. The awful layout. The layout on PS4 is amazing; you can even search, and there are some other options available. Why does the PC version look and subsequently act so atrociously? I swear, I thought Origin and early uPlay were terrible clients. PSNow is by far the worst PC client of the lot. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big advocate for the service as I think it's a great idea. However, it's an idea that Sony need to keep refining and perfecting. If you're allowing it on PC, at least show the PC component some TLC. ​ /endrant",,Inmate4815162342,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Where Sony has a service like PSNow that is kind of meh. But Xbox comes along and very aggressively pushes support on their own service with Gamepass. There was very little hype and no official support to PlayStations KB&M support; not to mention advertisement. Same scenario could be used with PS4 Pro and Xbox one X support. Xbox arguably went WAY harder into enhanced titles compared to Sony. I think it’s a safe bet that KB&M support will be a MUCH bigger deal on Xbox. Especially due to their already close ties on PC gaming.,,Carsickness,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I can name 10 amazing exclusives off the top of my head and that doesn't even scratch the surface of their total exclusives. I'd really like to hear what solid exclusives xbox has coming because I completely stopped paying attention to their lineup. Playstation has there equivalent of gamepass, playstation now. And playstation gives the opportunity to play some older games through playstation now. Not the same as backwards compatible but close. Most powerful console? True, but what's the point if there arent any good exclusives to test it out on? I think anybody would trade slightly better graphics for superior exclusive games. Playstation also has blu ray and has for longer than xbox. EA access? That's actually an offer I hadn't heard of and is a good one, I despise EA as do a ton of other people right now, and it's not like you cant play the same games on ps4 but a ton of games for $5/month is a good deal. Play anywhere for PC? If someone has the money to buy a PC why would they buy an xbox if they can already play xbox games on it? That reasoning doesn't make sense to me, it seems like more of a reason to buy a PC instead. The crossplatform with nintendo is a good feature and a good marketing plan for Microsoft, however with the pressure that Sony is currently under because of it, especially with bethesda weighing in with fallout 76 now, I personally believe it's only a matter of time before Sony caves. But that is a good reason. The elite controller? A ton of people prefer the ps4 controller to it, like myself, however the switch's pro controller is superior to either in my opinion. And xbox does have a more reliable online service. So I was wrong in saying that xbox had nothing but if all they have is a slightly more powerful console, a subscription to EA, play anywhere (which really seems like a reason to buy a PC to me), crossplat with nintendo (which id bet 10 to 1 that Sony caves before the years up) and a slightly more reliable online service, I'd still say that I'd prefer games like god of war, spider man, horizon zero dawn, persona 5, uncharted 4 and even more.",,McJubal,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,
