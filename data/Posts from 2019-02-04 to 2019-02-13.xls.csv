182749507571,2/11/2019,http://nikhilshakya5.tumblr.com/post/182749507571,"Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios boss Shawn Layden has laid down a ambitious prediction for where he thinks the video game industry could be headed. Speaking to Game Informer, Layden said he foresees some kind of “post-console” world where PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo are more unified than ever. While Layden maintains that PlayStation is the “best gaming experience,” he said Xbox One and Nintendo Switch offer “great experiences” as well, and PlayStation should do more to recognize that.

“I don’t want to put too fine a point on this because it might upset some of the people I work with, but I think effectively, we’re looking at kind of a post-console world where you can have quality gaming experiences across a variety of technologies,” he said. “Sure, PS4 and PS4 Pro provide what, of course, we think is the best gaming experience, but the other consoles out there, be it Switch, Xbox One X, or tablets, or phones–there are great experiences across all these. What we need to do is recognize all that.”

He added: “We’re not little gaming ghettos that are not federated or aligned at all. We’re all part of the same gaming community, we just come at it through different doorways. I think the future will be an extension of that metaphor. Your platform is not your hideaway. It’s just your doorway to all these other gamer folk.”

That’s an intriguing and surprising quote to hear from a PlayStation higher-up given that what Layden is suggesting is just about the opposite of what Sony’s approach has been in recent years. Controversially, the company initially said it wouldn’t allow cross-play between PS4 and other consoles because PlayStation is the best place to play. The company has since relented, and games like Fortnite and Rocket League support cross-play between PS4 and competing consoles.

Layden is not alone in talking about his desire for the walls between consoles to come down. EA’s CEO predicted a future for games where you can play on any device, while the CEO of Red Dead Redemption parent company Take-Two also has spoken about the closed system walls coming down and why that might be good. Pete Hines, an executive at Bethesda, said he wants to see the closed system walls between Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo come down so more people can play together.

“I think you’re going to see platforms get more homogenised,” Hines said. “Because truthfully, there’s really not a reason for [competing consoles] to be different. You don’t buy a DVD and then worry about which DVD player you have. You just buy a DVD and anything that plays DVDs works. And I think games are going to start to move closer and closer to that.”

Also in the interview, Layden talked about how the transition between console generations can be problematic and difficult.

“One of the terrible circumstances of our gaming industry is that every time we launch a new console technology, we sort of put the last generation to bed,” he said. “That doesn’t occur in movies. That doesn’t occur in music, but it occurs all the time in games.”

Sony’s game-streaming service, PlayStation Now, allows PS4 users to play PS3 games, but this is not the kind of true backwards compatibility that Xbox One offers. On PS4, you have to pay to play games through PlayStation Now, while Xbox One’s backwards compatibility feature recognizes the games you owned on Xbox 360 and lets you play them on Xbox One.

Layden also spoke about why Sony is not attending E3 this year. Expanding on what he told GameSpot sister site CNET, Layden said Sony just doesn’t have much to talk about.

“This year, coming to 2019, I’ll be honest–we just didn’t have a new story to tell. And when Sony rings the bell for everyone to come ‘round, they have an expectation for something that is completely new and amazing. We looked at the lineup and we can probably only give fans a lot of updates on things they already know, so how does this work for us?”

He added that Sony right now is releasing fewer games than it ever has in its history. “We’re doing fewer games at any given time than any time before in our history. Back in the day, when we were doing 15-20 games at a time; there was always a new game. Something was in a window that we could have that conversation about. But 2019, for us, that confluence just didn’t occur.”

Game Informer’s full interview with Layden is fascinating and in-depth–you can read it here.

We may be hearing more from Layden on the subject of a “post-console” world very soon. Layden will give the keynote address at the DICE Summit this week in Las Vegas. His speech is titled “Beyond Generations,” so you can expect he’ll give some predictions about the future of gaming.

Where do you think steam keys come from? Do you honestly think that Steam just *allows* random codes that give out digital property? Where do you think the sellers get the keys from? ​ Let me explain it to you, legitimate sellers such as Humble Bundle strike deals with developers to buy keys FROM STEAM at a discounted price, the developers lose money, but do you know why they allow it? Because Humble Bundle donates its profits to charity. Grey Market sites such as G2A get their keys by purchasing them with fraudulent cards, which means that the seller doesn't get the money and still has to pay out 30% of the sales price. ​ Which is why devs say it's BETTER to pirate games than buy keys from shady 3rd party websites. ​ ""but that's not an issue because everybody has steam already and steam works nicely."" Seriously, are you like twelve? ​ Let me tell you something, the average game has a profit margin of around 20-30%. So what do you think happens to a game that only sells averagely (20%) and steam takes 30% of their revenue? And I said revenue, so that's BEFORE the cost of development. ​ This is a waste of time. Listen, I pirated games too, but as I've gotten older and obtained my own income, I've phased it out with bundle services like Humble Bundle, and library services such as Origin Premier and PSNow. ​ Frankly, this discussion doesn't even belong in this sub, which is for PSNow. ​ ""Deep Silver is playing themselves."": As a gamer myself, I hate it when people say gamers are entitled.

If we look at current developments within the server realm we can see that the big push is to move everything into the cloud. We see cloud based windows applications, and cloud based film sites like Netflix. Gaming is also catching on with moves by major players in the industry to introduce game streaming eg playstation now, geforce now. Therefore if anything was to change server wise re Elite in the future it would be to move the game into the cloud, and have the game streamed to whatever device the user wishes to play the game on. This would obviously present new challenges specifically around peoples available network bandwidth, however i do wonder if Elites procedurally generated nature would mean that it is far less demanding network wise than other games with regard to streaming information. Presumably the seed data for procedurally generated assets could be sent over the net, and then the Frontier launcher would decrypt this seed data to produce the full image on screen, rather than having to send a full image file over the net. If everything was in the cloud then i could imagine that instances could be made far bigger, and significant developments could be made to the in game AI in terms of complexity, which would benefit from the number crunching power of servers. Please note i would not anticipate anything like this happening SOON. However it is worth looking at if thinking far into the future re Frontier and Elite.",,The Chairmaker,United Kingdom,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

182748005498,2/11/2019,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/182748005498,"Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios boss Shawn Layden has laid down a ambitious prediction for where he thinks the video game industry could be headed. Speaking to Game Informer, Layden said he foresees some kind of “post-console” world where PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo are more unified than ever. While Layden maintains that PlayStation is the “best gaming experience,” he said Xbox One and Nintendo Switch offer “great experiences” as well, and PlayStation should do more to recognize that.

“I don’t want to put too fine a point on this because it might upset some of the people I work with, but I think effectively, we’re looking at kind of a post-console world where you can have quality gaming experiences across a variety of technologies,” he said. “Sure, PS4 and PS4 Pro provide what, of course, we think is the best gaming experience, but the other consoles out there, be it Switch, Xbox One X, or tablets, or phones–there are great experiences across all these. What we need to do is recognize all that.”

He added: “We’re not little gaming ghettos that are not federated or aligned at all. We’re all part of the same gaming community, we just come at it through different doorways. I think the future will be an extension of that metaphor. Your platform is not your hideaway. It’s just your doorway to all these other gamer folk.”

That’s an intriguing and surprising quote to hear from a PlayStation higher-up given that what Layden is suggesting is just about the opposite of what Sony’s approach has been in recent years. Controversially, the company initially said it wouldn’t allow cross-play between PS4 and other consoles because PlayStation is the best place to play. The company has since relented, and games like Fortnite and Rocket League support cross-play between PS4 and competing consoles.

Layden is not alone in talking about his desire for the walls between consoles to come down. EA’s CEO predicted a future for games where you can play on any device, while the CEO of Red Dead Redemption parent company Take-Two also has spoken about the closed system walls coming down and why that might be good. Pete Hines, an executive at Bethesda, said he wants to see the closed system walls between Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo come down so more people can play together.

“I think you’re going to see platforms get more homogenised,” Hines said. “Because truthfully, there’s really not a reason for [competing consoles] to be different. You don’t buy a DVD and then worry about which DVD player you have. You just buy a DVD and anything that plays DVDs works. And I think games are going to start to move closer and closer to that.”

Also in the interview, Layden talked about how the transition between console generations can be problematic and difficult.

“One of the terrible circumstances of our gaming industry is that every time we launch a new console technology, we sort of put the last generation to bed,” he said. “That doesn’t occur in movies. That doesn’t occur in music, but it occurs all the time in games.”

Sony’s game-streaming service, PlayStation Now, allows PS4 users to play PS3 games, but this is not the kind of true backwards compatibility that Xbox One offers. On PS4, you have to pay to play games through PlayStation Now, while Xbox One’s backwards compatibility feature recognizes the games you owned on Xbox 360 and lets you play them on Xbox One.

Layden also spoke about why Sony is not attending E3 this year. Expanding on what he told GameSpot sister site CNET, Layden said Sony just doesn’t have much to talk about.

“This year, coming to 2019, I’ll be honest–we just didn’t have a new story to tell. And when Sony rings the bell for everyone to come ‘round, they have an expectation for something that is completely new and amazing. We looked at the lineup and we can probably only give fans a lot of updates on things they already know, so how does this work for us?”

He added that Sony right now is releasing fewer games than it ever has in its history. “We’re doing fewer games at any given time than any time before in our history. Back in the day, when we were doing 15-20 games at a time; there was always a new game. Something was in a window that we could have that conversation about. But 2019, for us, that confluence just didn’t occur.”

Game Informer’s full interview with Layden is fascinating and in-depth–you can read it here.

We may be hearing more from Layden on the subject of a “post-console” world very soon. Layden will give the keynote address at the DICE Summit this week in Las Vegas. His speech is titled “Beyond Generations,” so you can expect he’ll give some predictions about the future of gaming.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"PlayStation Boss Predicts ""Post-Console"" World",Post,,

182731676985,2/11/2019,http://stopdandruff.tumblr.com/post/182731676985,"If like us your gaming pile of shame stretches back not only through the current console generation, but back to the mid 90s too, the PS5 could perhaps be the next machine for you.

According to a newly-uncovered patent, the PlayStation 5 may be capable not only of playing souped-up next-generation titles, but also of emulating the PlayStation 4, PS3, PS2 and original PlayStation, aka the PSX.

The patent, numbered 2019-503013, was filed by the PS4’s lead architect Mark Cerny, and describes a process that would allow the next-gen CPU to “interpret” the the CPU of previous machines. It focusses on synchronisation errors – making sure that newer, more powerful hardware only sends required information from a game in response to a “call” from the title itself, rather than jumping the gun and overwriting data being held in RAM.

The last-gen battleground

The patent also discusses the possibility of simply including hardware chipsets that mimic older consoles in the cases where the legacy design is particularly difficult to emulate, as was the case with the PS2.

In the playground fights between PS4 and Xbox One players, the area of backwards compatibility has been a key one. The Xbox One has had extensive backwards compatibility with original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles for some time, and continues to grow its legacy library, with users needing merely to pop their old discs into the console to play.

The PS4 on the other hand has relied on its PlayStation Now streaming service, which requires the user pays a subscription fee and has a strong internet connection to stream old games over the internet. It’s had a mixed reception, and isn’t truly a replacement for dusting off your own, already-owned games.

This new patent, should Sony act upon its potential, shows the company is finally taking its back catalogue seriously. And with the PS4 still playing host to a mighty library of games, it would let new players hit the ground running with compatible PS5 titles right out of the box.

PlayStation Now: New Games for February 2019 Revealed





 PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming subscription service, which is designed for fans of the PlayStation family’s huge gaming catalog. Not to be confused with the PlayStation Plus membership club (which has its own separate library of playable titles), PlayStation Now allows users to stream and/or download a vast number of PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 games on either their PS4 or laptops.

In terms of pricing, the official PlayStation website will sell you a membership for $19.99 per month, $44.99 for three months, or $99.99 for the year. It is also possible, at the moment to try out the service with a 7-day free trial (if you can’t afford the payments, don’t forget to cancel your membership before the end of the trial period!). You can also pick up a membership on Amazon.

Each month, new games are added to the PlayStation Now library. Here’s what’s available this month:

Metal Gear Solid HD Collection

If you’ve ever wanted to jump into the twisted sci-fi world of Metal Gear Solid, then Metal Gear Solid HD Collection is a good place to start. A celebration of the franchise’s long history, this boxset comes packed with almost every main installment released to date, including the original Metal Gear games released for the MSX in the ’80s. The full list also includes Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 as well as Peacewalker, the excellent handheld precursor to Metal Gear Solid V. Note that there’s an even more complete edition of this HD re-release with more games called the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection on Amazon for $24.



Mortal Kombat X 

It’s time to test your might, fighting fans! Mortal Kombat X is the latest release in the gory fighting franchise. It features all new fighters as well as new takes on classic characters. An insane story involving multiple realms and a civil war for total dominance ties all of these fighters together in a battle that will decide the fate of Earthrealm. You’ll also get to play as a few bonus characters if you pick up the season pass, including the Xenomorph from Alien and Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is a perfect way to prepare yourself for Mortal Kombat 11! If you’d prefer a physical copy of this gorefest, you can pick one up for $19 on Amazon. 

PlayStation Now: Other New Games

Battlefield Hardline (PS3)

Earth Defense Force 4.1 (PS4)

F1 2017 (PS4)

Magicka 2 (PS4)

Metro Last Light Redux (PS4)

Need for Speed Rivals (PS3)

Pillars of Eternity (PS4)

Rebel Galaxy (PS4)

That’s all, folks! We’ll keep this list updated as Sony adds more games to PlayStation Now. Until then, check out what’s free this month on PlayStation Plus!",,shemo,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,PlayStation Now: New Games for February 2019 Revealed,Post,,

182748131626,2/11/2019,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/182748131626,"Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios boss Shawn Layden has laid down a ambitious prediction for where he thinks the video game industry could be headed. Speaking to Game Informer, Layden said he foresees some kind of “post-console” world where PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo are more unified than ever. While Layden maintains that PlayStation is the “best gaming experience,” he said Xbox One and Nintendo Switch offer “great experiences” as well, and PlayStation should do more to recognize that.

“I don’t want to put too fine a point on this because it might upset some of the people I work with, but I think effectively, we’re looking at kind of a post-console world where you can have quality gaming experiences across a variety of technologies,” he said. “Sure, PS4 and PS4 Pro provide what, of course, we think is the best gaming experience, but the other consoles out there, be it Switch, Xbox One X, or tablets, or phones–there are great experiences across all these. What we need to do is recognize all that.”

He added: “We’re not little gaming ghettos that are not federated or aligned at all. We’re all part of the same gaming community, we just come at it through different doorways. I think the future will be an extension of that metaphor. Your platform is not your hideaway. It’s just your doorway to all these other gamer folk.”

That’s an intriguing and surprising quote to hear from a PlayStation higher-up given that what Layden is suggesting is just about the opposite of what Sony’s approach has been in recent years. Controversially, the company initially said it wouldn’t allow cross-play between PS4 and other consoles because PlayStation is the best place to play. The company has since relented, and games like Fortnite and Rocket League support cross-play between PS4 and competing consoles.

Layden is not alone in talking about his desire for the walls between consoles to come down. EA’s CEO predicted a future for games where you can play on any device, while the CEO of Red Dead Redemption parent company Take-Two also has spoken about the closed system walls coming down and why that might be good. Pete Hines, an executive at Bethesda, said he wants to see the closed system walls between Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo come down so more people can play together.

“I think you’re going to see platforms get more homogenised,” Hines said. “Because truthfully, there’s really not a reason for [competing consoles] to be different. You don’t buy a DVD and then worry about which DVD player you have. You just buy a DVD and anything that plays DVDs works. And I think games are going to start to move closer and closer to that.”

Also in the interview, Layden talked about how the transition between console generations can be problematic and difficult.

“One of the terrible circumstances of our gaming industry is that every time we launch a new console technology, we sort of put the last generation to bed,” he said. “That doesn’t occur in movies. That doesn’t occur in music, but it occurs all the time in games.”

Sony’s game-streaming service, PlayStation Now, allows PS4 users to play PS3 games, but this is not the kind of true backwards compatibility that Xbox One offers. On PS4, you have to pay to play games through PlayStation Now, while Xbox One’s backwards compatibility feature recognizes the games you owned on Xbox 360 and lets you play them on Xbox One.

Layden also spoke about why Sony is not attending E3 this year. Expanding on what he told GameSpot sister site CNET, Layden said Sony just doesn’t have much to talk about.

“This year, coming to 2019, I’ll be honest–we just didn’t have a new story to tell. And when Sony rings the bell for everyone to come ‘round, they have an expectation for something that is completely new and amazing. We looked at the lineup and we can probably only give fans a lot of updates on things they already know, so how does this work for us?”

He added that Sony right now is releasing fewer games than it ever has in its history. “We’re doing fewer games at any given time than any time before in our history. Back in the day, when we were doing 15-20 games at a time; there was always a new game. Something was in a window that we could have that conversation about. But 2019, for us, that confluence just didn’t occur.”

Game Informer’s full interview with Layden is fascinating and in-depth–you can read it here.

We may be hearing more from Layden on the subject of a “post-console” world very soon. Layden will give the keynote address at the DICE Summit this week in Las Vegas. His speech is titled “Beyond Generations,” so you can expect he’ll give some predictions about the future of gaming.

Supporting the GBA or GCN for just a few years was fine, because they both had a low price. Plus, there isn’t currently a way to make a hybrid console on the level of what the PS5 will be simply because battery tech can’t support it, so any heavily increased power console from Nintendo would have to be a stationary console again, which is less than ideal.",,Thrasher7170,United States of America,,,Negative,Disgust,Forums,,,,,,,,

By the holiday season, gamers will have the ability to play over 100 digital or disc-based Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One via a software emulator. One of the people surprised by Microsoft's announcement was Sony Worldwide Studios head Shuhei Yoshida. ""It was surprising,"" he said in an interview with Eurogamer , ""I didn't think it was possible. There must be lots of engineering effort."" And he's right: Microsoft's General Manager of Games Publishing Shannon Loftis explained to Engadget that backwards compatibility on the Xbox One required ""some pretty dedicated engineering effort and very talented engineers."" Emulation of more powerful consoles like the Xbox 360 has historically been very tricky to achieve, but Microsoft's in-depth knowledge of the console's architecture certainly would have helped. As for PlayStation 3 emulation on the PlayStation 4, Yoshida basically said it's not going to happen. ""PS3 is such a unique architecture, and some games made use of SPUs very well. It's going to be super challenging to do so. I never say never, but we have no plans."" Yoshida does wonder what sort of games the Xbox One's Xbox 360 emulator will be able to handle, stating that Microsoft ""talked about 100 games, but what kind of games will be included? Is it smaller games or big games? We don't know."" Microsoft has announced 18 backwards compatible games so far, including Mass Effect , though most titles are hardly graphically intensive. Meanwhile, Microsoft is currently asking gamers what Xbox 360 games they want to see supported by the Xbox One. Leading the list at the moment is Red Dead Redemption , and most of the requested titles will take a fair bit of horsepower to emulate efficiently and without bugs. On the other hand, Sony will continue to offer PS3 backwards compatibility on the PS4 through its PlayStation Now service, which streams older games to the console over the internet. However, PlayStation Now is rather pricey, and it doesn't allow you to play your existing library of PS3 games for free, nor is it as effective as proper (working) native emulation. From that perspective, it seems like Microsoft will have the better and more effective way of playing older games on this generation of consoles, so long as the company can deliver on its promise of functional, smooth software emulation. Permalink to story. https://www.techspot.com/news/61045-playstation-4-not-getting-backwards-compatibility.html ====================::==================== I for one am actually someone who would love to have backward compatibility. I actually used the backward compatibility on my Xbox 360 to play original Xbox games like Halo 1 and 2 and NFL 2K5. Not every old game is going to be worthy of playing on the newer system, but there are some gems out there or games that someone might have really connected with and represents a particular period of time in their life. Games like that are too good to get stuffed in a box and forgotten. The fact that their seem to be almost as many remastered titles as actual new titles should show that people still want to play older games. PC has consoles beat with this regard. You can play any game from any time and not have to worry about dragging out old hardware to do it. I have a PS3 and PS4 as well and PS4 does have PlayStation Now, but I'm not enthused to pay for games that I already own on disc or have already purchased digitally. I think a better way for PlayStation to adapt their Now service is to let you play the PS3 games if you had purchased a digital copy previously on your PS3 or if you own the disc. If you own the disc, it has to be inserted to play. If you hadn't purchased a digital copy already or don't have a disc then you buy it through their Now service. This is exactly what Xbox is doing with their backward compatibility. On Xbox One if you own the disc or purchased a digital copy you get to play the game. If you don't have the disc or didn't previously purchase it digitally, then you can still buy it digitally on your Xbox One. I'm currently in Xbox's preview program and have been able to play a select few Xbox 360 games on my Xbox One and so far it works really well and look forward to more titles being added.",,Kevin82485,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,The 4 will not be getting backwards compatibility,,,

None of what you is said is true. Sony has had a functional Cloud based gaming service for 5 years straight. Microsoft hasn't even started the race... @Jacanuk said: @lundy86_4 said: Link. It's quite clear that cloud gaming will become a threat... It's where we're heading. It's largely why Sony needs to address that aspect... Plan for cloud platforms on lackluster hardware. They bought and integrated Gaikai for a reason. Hmm, not sure how it would be a threat, it´s not like streaming music or movies which you can do from a toaster or a 10-year-old iPhone. Cloud gaming requires a fast internet connection and also pretty decent hardware to make it anything you would expect on a console. So we are at least a decade or two away from Cloud gaming being anything more than an experiment, and yes I know PSNOW is around but even with a decent connection it has issues that you would not see on an actual console. I detailed a bit of me following internet based cloud gaming for the past 15 years. I can tell you we are at the point where it becomes mainstream. Anyone who has actually been following this knows that we were ""a decade or two away from Cloud gaming"" 15 years ago.... We are 5, 10 years tops from mainstream cloud gaming and that includes on mobile networks. Like I said. I've been following digital distribution gaming and subscription services for the past 15 years. I use ""cloud gaming"" NOW and on my smartphone/tablet right now. No caveats. People have been using cloud gaming on mainstream consoles for the past 5 years already. The Wii U was essentially build around the premise of using remote hardware to play a game on a less powerful device. These are all the same concepts on display here. Yes the specific implementations may look different but the principles remain the same. Gamers are already and have already been playing games on hardware other than their physical consoles for years already. The expectation that this concept is 20 years in the future is misguided and ill-informed even about current trends in gaming happening today.

182748133977,2/11/2019,http://igotpenandtagon.tumblr.com/post/182748133977,"Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios boss Shawn Layden has laid down a ambitious prediction for where he thinks the video game industry could be headed. Speaking to Game Informer, Layden said he foresees some kind of “post-console” world where PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo are more unified than ever. While Layden maintains that PlayStation is the “best gaming experience,” he said Xbox One and Nintendo Switch offer “great experiences” as well, and PlayStation should do more to recognize that.

“I don’t want to put too fine a point on this because it might upset some of the people I work with, but I think effectively, we’re looking at kind of a post-console world where you can have quality gaming experiences across a variety of technologies,” he said. “Sure, PS4 and PS4 Pro provide what, of course, we think is the best gaming experience, but the other consoles out there, be it Switch, Xbox One X, or tablets, or phones–there are great experiences across all these. What we need to do is recognize all that.”

He added: “We’re not little gaming ghettos that are not federated or aligned at all. We’re all part of the same gaming community, we just come at it through different doorways. I think the future will be an extension of that metaphor. Your platform is not your hideaway. It’s just your doorway to all these other gamer folk.”

That’s an intriguing and surprising quote to hear from a PlayStation higher-up given that what Layden is suggesting is just about the opposite of what Sony’s approach has been in recent years. Controversially, the company initially said it wouldn’t allow cross-play between PS4 and other consoles because PlayStation is the best place to play. The company has since relented, and games like Fortnite and Rocket League support cross-play between PS4 and competing consoles.

Layden is not alone in talking about his desire for the walls between consoles to come down. EA’s CEO predicted a future for games where you can play on any device, while the CEO of Red Dead Redemption parent company Take-Two also has spoken about the closed system walls coming down and why that might be good. Pete Hines, an executive at Bethesda, said he wants to see the closed system walls between Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo come down so more people can play together.

“I think you’re going to see platforms get more homogenised,” Hines said. “Because truthfully, there’s really not a reason for [competing consoles] to be different. You don’t buy a DVD and then worry about which DVD player you have. You just buy a DVD and anything that plays DVDs works. And I think games are going to start to move closer and closer to that.”

Also in the interview, Layden talked about how the transition between console generations can be problematic and difficult.

“One of the terrible circumstances of our gaming industry is that every time we launch a new console technology, we sort of put the last generation to bed,” he said. “That doesn’t occur in movies. That doesn’t occur in music, but it occurs all the time in games.”

Sony’s game-streaming service, PlayStation Now, allows PS4 users to play PS3 games, but this is not the kind of true backwards compatibility that Xbox One offers. On PS4, you have to pay to play games through PlayStation Now, while Xbox One’s backwards compatibility feature recognizes the games you owned on Xbox 360 and lets you play them on Xbox One.

Layden also spoke about why Sony is not attending E3 this year. Expanding on what he told GameSpot sister site CNET, Layden said Sony just doesn’t have much to talk about.

“This year, coming to 2019, I’ll be honest–we just didn’t have a new story to tell. And when Sony rings the bell for everyone to come ‘round, they have an expectation for something that is completely new and amazing. We looked at the lineup and we can probably only give fans a lot of updates on things they already know, so how does this work for us?”

He added that Sony right now is releasing fewer games than it ever has in its history. “We’re doing fewer games at any given time than any time before in our history. Back in the day, when we were doing 15-20 games at a time; there was always a new game. Something was in a window that we could have that conversation about. But 2019, for us, that confluence just didn’t occur.”

Game Informer’s full interview with Layden is fascinating and in-depth–you can read it here.

We may be hearing more from Layden on the subject of a “post-console” world very soon. Layden will give the keynote address at the DICE Summit this week in Las Vegas. His speech is titled “Beyond Generations,” so you can expect he’ll give some predictions about the future of gaming.

This past week we’ve had some interesting things come across ours paths. First off, we got news of a possible Catherine 2 game being in the makes! If you didn’t know about Catherine, this was a game in which we had a guy who had a love relations with evil and good version of “Catherine”. It was a puzzler game but was very mature and very fun. We also got hints of a possible Alice Madness 3 being in the makes. Can things get any better this week?! Lastly, we also got news of PS5 having backwards compatibility! This is huge news, especially because one of the major set backs from the PS4 was that you had to pay for a subscription service called PSNOW, which is $20 a month, to stream Playstation 1 2 and 3 classic hits. Lastly, we also got news of a DR. MARIO game coming out for the Nintendo Switch! There hasn’t been a Dr. Mario game out since the 90′s! This comes shortly after the news of a possible new version of the Nintendo Switch that may be launching soon.

None of what you is said is true. Sony has had a functional Cloud based gaming service for 5 years straight. Microsoft hasn't even started the race... @Jacanuk said: @lundy86_4 said: Link. It's quite clear that cloud gaming will become a threat... It's where we're heading. It's largely why Sony needs to address that aspect... Plan for cloud platforms on lackluster hardware. They bought and integrated Gaikai for a reason. Hmm, not sure how it would be a threat, it´s not like streaming music or movies which you can do from a toaster or a 10-year-old iPhone. Cloud gaming requires a fast internet connection and also pretty decent hardware to make it anything you would expect on a console. So we are at least a decade or two away from Cloud gaming being anything more than an experiment, and yes I know PSNOW is around but even with a decent connection it has issues that you would not see on an actual console. I detailed a bit of me following internet based cloud gaming for the past 15 years. I can tell you we are at the point where it becomes mainstream. Anyone who has actually been following this knows that we were ""a decade or two away from Cloud gaming"" 15 years ago.... We are 5, 10 years tops from mainstream cloud gaming and that includes on mobile networks. Like I said. I've been following digital distribution gaming and subscription services for the past 15 years. I use ""cloud gaming"" NOW and on my smartphone/tablet right now. No caveats. People have been using cloud gaming on mainstream consoles for the past 5 years already. The Wii U was essentially build around the premise of using remote hardware to play a game on a less powerful device. These are all the same concepts on display here. Yes the specific implementations may look different but the principles remain the same. Gamers are already and have already been playing games on hardware other than their physical consoles for years already. The expectation that this concept is 20 years in the future is misguided and ill-informed even about current trends in gaming happening today. Yea and it's tiny in comparison. Umm.. by comparison to standard home consoles that have been around for ALMOST 50 YEARS ........ um yeah. But, no where near as tiny as you think and this is just it's infancy. Again, if anyone thinks this is just some niche fad, that is still decades from hitting the mainstream then they really haven't been paying attention for the past decade and a half and likely not qualified to actually have an informed opinion.",,michaelmikado,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

There will probably be software implementations, if there aren't already. Looking further into the future, I am still curious if Sony will provide more integration between their mobiles and PlayStation. They keep saying that they're keeping the mobile division around because of its importance in having a testbed for 5G and other techs, and we've gotten patents from them showing off the idea of PlayStation tablets, like this: https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/sony-handheld-patent-switch/ My thinking is that as PS5 gets closer to launch (current best estimates are end of 2020) Sony will be expanding their PlayStation Now streaming service onto all mobiles and other devices. By this point in time 5G will be more widespread, and that extra speed and (hopefully) significantly larger data caps will be necessary to allow for a quality experience of playing console level games on mobile. By keeping Sony Mobile going Sony will have their own in-house mobile team to use for testing and improving upon those services. This is just a guess on one possible reason they're fighting to keep the mobile division going. Hopefully in that time frame they can also turn the division around to make it profitable.",,vivftp,Norway,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

PlayStation Now: New Games for February 2019 Revealed





 PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming subscription service, which is designed for fans of the PlayStation family’s huge gaming catalog. Not to be confused with the PlayStation Plus membership club (which has its own separate library of playable titles), PlayStation Now allows users to stream and/or download a vast number of PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 games on either their PS4 or laptops.

In terms of pricing, the official PlayStation website will sell you a membership for $19.99 per month, $44.99 for three months, or $99.99 for the year. It is also possible, at the moment to try out the service with a 7-day free trial (if you can’t afford the payments, don’t forget to cancel your membership before the end of the trial period!). You can also pick up a membership on Amazon.

Each month, new games are added to the PlayStation Now library. Here’s what’s available this month:

Metal Gear Solid HD Collection

If you’ve ever wanted to jump into the twisted sci-fi world of Metal Gear Solid, then Metal Gear Solid HD Collection is a good place to start. A celebration of the franchise’s long history, this boxset comes packed with almost every main installment released to date, including the original Metal Gear games released for the MSX in the ’80s. The full list also includes Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 as well as Peacewalker, the excellent handheld precursor to Metal Gear Solid V. Note that there’s an even more complete edition of this HD re-release with more games called the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection on Amazon for $24.



Mortal Kombat X 

It’s time to test your might, fighting fans! Mortal Kombat X is the latest release in the gory fighting franchise. It features all new fighters as well as new takes on classic characters. An insane story involving multiple realms and a civil war for total dominance ties all of these fighters together in a battle that will decide the fate of Earthrealm. You’ll also get to play as a few bonus characters if you pick up the season pass, including the Xenomorph from Alien and Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is a perfect way to prepare yourself for Mortal Kombat 11! If you’d prefer a physical copy of this gorefest, you can pick one up for $19 on Amazon. 

PlayStation Now: Other New Games

Battlefield Hardline (PS3)

Earth Defense Force 4.1 (PS4)

F1 2017 (PS4)

Magicka 2 (PS4)

Metro Last Light Redux (PS4)

Need for Speed Rivals (PS3)

Pillars of Eternity (PS4)

Rebel Galaxy (PS4)

That’s all, folks! We’ll keep this list updated as Sony adds more games to PlayStation Now. Until then, check out what’s free this month on PlayStation Plus!",,antimatterprince,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,PlayStation Now: New Games for February 2019 Revealed,Post,,

At this point, I’d rather have a menu of classic games to buy, back up my saves manually and pay for NSO only if there was real value derived in the form of stable multiplayer experiences that were fully developed and integrated into their games. A menu of NES games that somehow have a “magical” overlay where a second player does something entirely useless - or simply allows for P2P multi on a game from 35 years ago is not a great business model.

It's quite clear that cloud gaming will become a threat... It's where we're heading. It's largely why Sony needs to address that aspect... Plan for cloud platforms on lackluster hardware. They bought and integrated Gaikai for a reason. Hmm, not sure how it would be a threat, it´s not like streaming music or movies which you can do from a toaster or a 10-year-old iPhone. Cloud gaming requires a fast internet connection and also pretty decent hardware to make it anything you would expect on a console. So we are at least a decade or two away from Cloud gaming being anything more than an experiment, and yes I know PSNOW is around but even with a decent connection it has issues that you would not see on an actual console.",,Jacanuk,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

That division is the largest contributor to the company's operating income at more than 30 percent."" Click to expand... I feel like this is the sort of thing that could make them be more cautious about spending on next generation in terms of not feeding the egos of internet warriors, and instead again approaching the console budget with Fiscal Responsibility™ ala PS4. PS4 is somewhat running into a pure sales number issue since they've effectively hit PS3's 8 year sales numbers in the span of ~5. That's a bit of a problem for growth as it is becoming very difficult to cost reduce, and well, maybe the bean counters took a look at the PS3 sales data post-2013, and it just wouldn't be realistic to expect the same legs as PS2 to taper off the generation. So how much more could they expect to grow the userbase even with a meager price reduction? Furthermore, that's the sort of very long term planning that may have implications for next generation - assuming they similarly sell very well, and there's no particular good reason to think otherwise for the time being - in that sense, how much do they *really* need to spend to sell to their considerable fanbase when it's about hitting that sweet spot. Someone with more knowledge about the projections for global economy or just big markets such as the US or UK (*ahem*) might chime in about possible consumer spending habits (although certainly in rough times, the need to be entertained is much higher). Sony could just pour more effort into 4Pro now that their plans have been pushed back, and perhaps it would actually be worthwhile to shift to 7nm since there can be overlap in sales between 4Pro and existing PS4 owners, not just trying to find new folks to sell to beyond the 90 million mark. The next question is how long that lasts and how it might fit into the next gen transition may or may not be tricky considering the nature of 4Pro's price point. R&D for 7nm could be amortized to some extent between 4ProSlim and 4SKim anyway. We've discussed elsewhere the implications and possibilities for switching memory types as well. /rant ====================::==================== Gaming division revenue up 10% YoY. But the division profit dropped 14% YoY. Uh.. Next gen investment impact, and they said they were accelerating PSNow deployment? Should it start being visible in the financials now or is the r&d investment usually showing up earlier or later or just invisible? Different columns? Right now we should be somewhere equivalent to early 2012, comparatively to ps4 launch.",,MrFox,Germany,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,Al purpose Sales and Sales Rumours and Anecdotes [2019 Edition],,,

Atm most Microsoft exclusives aren't that attractive (except for Horizon 4), but I'm sure this might change in the future. My brother lately bought an X1X with a 3 month subscription. There were like 4 games that interested us and all of them also were on PC. It's not a bad service, even a great one if you're interested in the games, but when 95% is just filler and mediocre or just doesn't me, it's not that much of a great service at all.

I guess my only hope now is for PSnow to release it as a title. Sorry to bust your bubble but PSnow is bound by the same laws that prevent anybody from offering or selling it. Payment for it has to go to the person that holds the rights and nobody holds them because the game code is owned by Ubisoft but the IP belongs to the creator of the comics.

The monthly free games in those services are really appealing and the integration with online play is just better. But I'm happy with Switch Online so far.

The future of game streaming is an open road. But we already have some markets we can use to draw a map: online video streaming services. If we’re not careful, game streaming will hit the same speed bumps.

As Microsoft, Sony, NVIDIA, Google, and others start to ramp up their game streaming subscription services, we can already see what the biggest problem for gamers will be: an increasingly fragmented selection. As platforms and consoles fight to get the biggest and best games on their streaming service, and only their streaming service, gamers will find that it’s impossible to play all the titles they want on just one of them. Not that this is anything new for the gaming industry, of course: it’s the good old-fashioned platform exclusivity problem, now spread out among more and more platforms.

Streaming Looms On The Horizon

To be clear about our terms: the “game streaming” in this article refers to playing video games in your home over a broadband connection, where the actual hardware that hosts the game (the PC or game console doing the number-crunching) is on a server somewhere.

Current examples include PlayStation Now, which streams a selection of PS2, PS3, and PS4 games to either a regular PS4 or a program running on your computer, NVIDIA GeForce NOW, which can stream full-power PC games to either the NVIDIA SHIELD set-top box or PCs, and Google’s Project Stream, which used a single PC game in a test run earlier this year.

We’re not talking about streaming video of someone else playing a game that you watch on a service like YouTube or Twitch.
NVIDIA
If you’re not familiar with it: game streaming is very cool. It enables someone with minimal hardware, like, say, a $200 SHIELD, to play games that are otherwise limited to a $1000 gaming PC. It doesn’t need local media or massive 50GB downloads, and a relatively small monthly charge can give you access to hundreds of games, a la the Netflix setup. Regarding pure hardware, the only real downer is that you need a solid broadband connection: most of these services recommend 25 Mbps, but I’ve found that they tend to stutter on anything less than 50.

With those pieces in place, the experience is pretty amazing. You can play games at maximum graphical settings with almost perfect sync, including the fastest multiplayer shooters or fighters. And it’s only going to get better and more available: Microsoft is heavily rumored to be developing a streaming-only version of the next Xbox console, the service of which would undoubtedly be available on Windows, too. Even Nintendo is dipping a toe in: the company is currently streaming some older titles to SHIELD owners in China. Predictably, Amazon is looking to get in on this action as well.

Here’s where the “but” comes in.

The Library Problem

Streaming video services are fighting tooth and nail to get original, exclusive content: Netflix’s has its high-profile Marvel series, conventional shows like Orange is the New Black, and even full theatrical movies like Bird Box. Hulu has exclusives like The Handmaid’s Tale and continuations like The Mindy Project. Amazon Prime video is home to shows like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Man in the High Castle.
Video services compete for exclusive shows like The Handmaid’s Tale. Hulu

I want to own UC/DC to play whenever I want regardless of having internet or not. That's how most people feel and why I doubt psnow makes as much money as if they just sold the games that where on them. Sony just wont let it go though.

As for your argument look at the amount of xbox games, there are 2k xbox 360 games and less than a quarter of them are backwards compatable, with a further 1000 games from the original xbox. but hey would you look at this ""all the ps2 ps3 and ps4 games are ready to stream on psnow"" that means THREE GENERATIONS OF GAMES CONSOLES ENTIRE LIBRARY is avalible on ONE console which is BIGGER than the measily 2k games that are compatable on the xbox 1. also you gotta think about this, business wise why would a company make a console backwards compatable? i could get a copy of a ps3 game for ~£1-£10 some rare cases might push it higher, and obviously if i get collector edition stuff its even higher, but from my money how much of it hits the developers? 0%. so from that why make backwards compatable when you can make a port? take a look at the library of games when they mentioned backwards compatability, there were a few games that were made for that system that werent remasters (or as you call them ports which btw is wrong its only a port if you go from one platform to another not going over generations) but you had several games that were, skyrim for example and the call of duties are technically remasters cause they dont really make anything new, its just last years game with more DLC. so without backwards compatability they can get ~£60 for nostalgia, kh1.5 and 2.5 when released, full price game now if i got the content from thoes games on original hardware and could backwards compatable them then square/disney would have gotten 0 of my money (also as another side nintendo hand helds always support the previous generation of handhelds backwards compatable)",,quickhakker,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

PlayStation Now: New Games for February 2019 Revealed





 PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming subscription service, which is designed for fans of the PlayStation family’s huge gaming catalog. Not to be confused with the PlayStation Plus membership club (which has its own separate library of playable titles), PlayStation Now allows users to stream and/or download a vast number of PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 games on either their PS4 or laptops.

In terms of pricing, the official PlayStation website will sell you a membership for $19.99 per month, $44.99 for three months, or $99.99 for the year. It is also possible, at the moment to try out the service with a 7-day free trial (if you can’t afford the payments, don’t forget to cancel your membership before the end of the trial period!). You can also pick up a membership on Amazon.

Each month, new games are added to the PlayStation Now library. Here’s what’s available this month:

Metal Gear Solid HD Collection

If you’ve ever wanted to jump into the twisted sci-fi world of Metal Gear Solid, then Metal Gear Solid HD Collection is a good place to start. A celebration of the franchise’s long history, this boxset comes packed with almost every main installment released to date, including the original Metal Gear games released for the MSX in the ’80s. The full list also includes Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 as well as Peacewalker, the excellent handheld precursor to Metal Gear Solid V. Note that there’s an even more complete edition of this HD re-release with more games called the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection on Amazon for $24.



Mortal Kombat X 

It’s time to test your might, fighting fans! Mortal Kombat X is the latest release in the gory fighting franchise. It features all new fighters as well as new takes on classic characters. An insane story involving multiple realms and a civil war for total dominance ties all of these fighters together in a battle that will decide the fate of Earthrealm. You’ll also get to play as a few bonus characters if you pick up the season pass, including the Xenomorph from Alien and Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is a perfect way to prepare yourself for Mortal Kombat 11! If you’d prefer a physical copy of this gorefest, you can pick one up for $19 on Amazon. 

PlayStation Now: Other New Games

Battlefield Hardline (PS3)

Earth Defense Force 4.1 (PS4)

F1 2017 (PS4)

Magicka 2 (PS4)

Metro Last Light Redux (PS4)

Need for Speed Rivals (PS3)

Pillars of Eternity (PS4)

Rebel Galaxy (PS4)

That’s all, folks! We’ll keep this list updated as Sony adds more games to PlayStation Now. Until then, check out what’s free this month on PlayStation Plus!",,daddy-dallas,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,PlayStation Now: New Games for February 2019 Revealed,Post,,

They do stuff like Game Pass (which is a MUCH better service than PSNow and cheaper to boot), backwards compatibility, crossplay etc. because it makes them seem more consumer-friendly and is good for their PR. I think *most* people would agree Microsoft does more for consumers, but that Sony makes the better exclusive games. This is also a high level change of strategy at Microsoft, they've been becoming really user-friendly in other ways as well... years ago if you told me that Microsoft would have the most-used coding program I would laugh in your face, but VSCode is a marvel and maybe the biggest indicator of change at Microsoft there has been.

The last time I tried Now, it didn't seem like the interface changed at all from the first time I used it. It wasn't a surprise. It was a calculated business decision. They forsaw how tech would change the market, and made preemptive moves to capitalize off of it before their competitors. It served them well, but overall, I do not like this direction. It depends on advanced infrastructure, which lol, requires economic and social planning -- something next to impossible in our current economic context on the entire globe.

That division is the largest contributor to the company's operating income at more than 30 percent."" Click to expand... I feel like this is the sort of thing that could make them be more cautious about spending on next generation in terms of not feeding the egos of internet warriors, and instead again approaching the console budget with Fiscal Responsibility™ ala PS4. PS4 is somewhat running into a pure sales number issue since they've effectively hit PS3's 8 year sales numbers in the span of ~5. That's a bit of a problem for growth as it is becoming very difficult to cost reduce, and well, maybe the bean counters took a look at the PS3 sales data post-2013, and it just wouldn't be realistic to expect the same legs as PS2 to taper off the generation. So how much more could they expect to grow the userbase even with a meager price reduction? Furthermore, that's the sort of very long term planning that may have implications for next generation - assuming they similarly sell very well, and there's no particular good reason to think otherwise for the time being - in that sense, how much do they *really* need to spend to sell to their considerable fanbase when it's about hitting that sweet spot. Someone with more knowledge about the projections for global economy or just big markets such as the US or UK (*ahem*) might chime in about possible consumer spending habits (although certainly in rough times, the need to be entertained is much higher). Sony could just pour more effort into 4Pro now that their plans have been pushed back, and perhaps it would actually be worthwhile to shift to 7nm since there can be overlap in sales between 4Pro and existing PS4 owners, not just trying to find new folks to sell to beyond the 90 million mark. The next question is how long that lasts and how it might fit into the next gen transition may or may not be tricky considering the nature of 4Pro's price point. R&D for 7nm could be amortized to some extent between 4ProSlim and 4SKim anyway. We've discussed elsewhere the implications and possibilities for switching memory types as well. /rant ====================::==================== MrFox said: ↑ Uh.. Next gen investment impact, and they said they were accelerating PSNow deployment? Should it start being visible in the financials now or is the r&d investment usually showing up earlier or later or just invisible? Different columns? Click to expand... PSNow is in the most expensive server resource deployment stage which contributes toward the apparanent revenue/profit discrepancy beyond the global economic slowdown. Plus PS5 has to eating through significant money at this stage.

182547944926,2/4/2019,http://fp-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/182547944926,"It’s been more than six years since Sony last released a major new console and if history is any indicator, a new console launch is imminent. Now we don’t have an exact timeframe for the launch, but the pace at which new rumours pop up has been increasing, which could mean that a new console is arriving very soon. E3 2019, maybe?

A Japanese patent, which a Reddit post claims to be a patent registered by Sony for the PlayStation 5, has appeared online. The patent states that PS5 will have backward compatibility with the PS4, PS3, PS2 and PSX. Another report by Tweak Town said that last year something similar was revealed about the PS5, wherein Sony was implementing hardware-level support for backwards compatibility. Also, Sony already has a subscription service called PlayStation Now which gives access to a growing library of over 700 PS4, PS3 and PS2 games on PS4 and PC.

Microsoft’s Xbox One also has backward compatibility with most its previous gen console title and this is something Sony will not want to ignore in the PS5.

But that doesn´t change anything about it being a great game objectively. That's fair, your opinion, but Uncharted 4 is definitely not a great game. It follows the same tired formula, isn't as impressive as the earlier games were for their advances in animation and voice acting, and is painfully long (like 16 hours when it should have been 10). Uncharted 2 is considered by most to be the peak of the series, not just me. Also you can play a number of those games on a PC with PSNow without even owning a PS4. That isnt the case with the Switch. > But there is a reason why PS4 is so widespread, and their big selection of quality games is a big part of it. The reason the PS4 has sold so well is that it only competes directly with Xbox,and Microsoft absolutely shit the bed with the XB1 at launch and were never able to recover.",,caninehere,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Pros: A lot faster than the PS3 in general Tons of free games Playstation Now is a pretty decent deal and has a wide selection Tons of media apps like netflix, hulu, amazon video, funimation, etc... Controller allows you to change brightness of glow Tons of customization options to suit your console to you (including high contrast) Playstation plus seems to offer better deals for digital. Cons: No more composite output, which means I cannott get audio through my pc the easy way When you are downloading many items there can be menu lag Some apps tend to glitch and close application isn't an option. However, you can easily just restart. I got this because I had no reason to get the PS4 Pro, I don't have a 4K TV nor do I really care about 4K Gaming (and the 6-8 games that are supported for 4K on the Pro.) Honestly I just found this to be a better deal, as the Pro just seems to be a lazy cashgrab. It definitely is slim and fits into pretty much any keyboard space.

Oh, I wasn't aware people still borrowed physical games from each other. I know people bitched about the original plan for XBONE to have strong DRM which made swapping games inpossible, then forced them to change that. Your other posts made it more clear you want something for nothing and feels you're entitled to getting something for nothing. This might surprise you but the companies that make video games DO need to pay their employees, who in turn need to be able to provide for their families. Not that you care, just saying. The Industry is in it to make money first and foremost. That hasn't changed at all since first video games. The only thing that's changed is after the ET Fiasco almost killed the industry back in the early 80s, the industry started setting and raising standards and expectations. I'll stop the history lesson there but that's where it began. Originally Posted by RussW210 Any wise investor/gaming company don't want this to happen though. They want Gamestop to die and for digital to be our only means of purchasing, with no free/limited time sharing option. I think developers know that there is a large community of people who get a good 1-2 weeks out of a game and they are done with it. Those people who are not going to pay full price for the game, will still pay in the end. ...Yeah, and it's why gaming companies known for making console games have been getting into the mobile market in recent years. They're targeting casuals and non-gamers who may not be familiar with them more or less. Bethesda's Fallout Shelter is arguably the most engaging F2P on the mobile market. You can enjoy all the features without spending a dime, too (resource management gets easier once you pass 10 floors). Back on topic, I do think digital only consoles are inevitable. The Classic Console Niche (NES, SNES and PS1) is an experiment in that regard to me. So was the PSP Go, which was a Digital Only handheld. I do remember hearing rumors when the PS4 Pro was in development that Sony was looking into making a digital-only variant of the PS4 that would have more storage to compensate. There are several challenges that would need to be worked out before console makers can go all-in with Digital Only game systems. The two biggest ones for me are prevention of data loss and storage space personally. Originally Posted by Unholyground Then they need to bring the game prices down simple as that or piracy is going to increase, or contend that not everyone is going to find value in owning a game and will find a way to play it. Again: Why do you have the unrealistic expectation--and the audacity in my boook--you feel you're entitled to play console games for free just because you don't want to pay for it because reasons? Obviously you're referring to piracy but if that's what you wanna do, meh. Speaking of, have you not heard of Playstation Now? It's Streaming Service you can use to play PS4 games without actually buying them. You pay a monthly subscription instead.

Layden didn't discuss the new device. But he did say new technologies that could replace home consoles, like game streaming technology similar to Netflix, are still years away from mass adoption. He also hinted that Sony's ready to buy up other game makers as it looks to expand the types of games it makes. He isn't alone, either. Microsoft's Xbox team has announced several game studio acquisitions in the past year as gaming takes on more prominence at that company. With games like Fortnite: Battle Royale becoming so popular, how do you decide what types of games to make? Whether it's creating a direct competitor me-too type game or something different? I don't want to get into me-too, it seems like I think the world's got all the battle royale it needs right now. I think we've done a lot over the last three or four years to get us to a place right now where we're building fewer games per year than ever before, but we're spending more time, more energy, certainly more money, on making them. So we're striking on all the beats that we want to, and we're getting both critical and commercial acclaim. Let's see now what we might add to our arsenal. I've looked at some opportunities in the past, it's an opportunity to look for the ones that are the best cultural fit. How do you decide what game makers you'll buy? We're always exploring opportunities. If we found a partner or a team or a game that we felt was particularly meaningful and interesting in a service area, we will look to bring that in. We're always open to that kind of experience. We try to make it really easy for our teams to focus on what our vision is for the future. And we have simplified it to ""first, best or must."" If your title is going to be ""first"" and creating a genre, or ""first"" and creating a new game activity, let's look at that. If you're going to make an action adventure game, It better be ""best"" in class. And we have the third category called ""must,"" which is we must support the platform, we must be present when new technology comes out. With all this streaming talk, is it worth it yet? You have PlayStation Now, and I've used it, but I wouldn't play a shooting game on it. It doesn't feel ready to replace my console. It's definitely a thing. The challenge around streaming is that while it may get to a place reasonably quickly that folks who live on top of a good node in SOMA or Seoul or Stockholm can get a good streaming life, if you're PlayStation and you're available in 168 countries around the world, streaming will be a thing which will have interest to certain people in certain places. But still, for the vast majority of the gaming community, our 94 million PlayStation 4s out there, I think there's much life left in a local console. You're not the first big company to bow out of the big E3 video game show in June, but I'm curious why you chose this year to drop out? When we decided to take video games out of CES, back in 1995 during the PlayStation 1 era, E3 served two constituencies: retailers and journalists. Retailers would come in -- you'd see a guy come in, and he'd say, ""I'm from Sears, and I handle Hot Wheels, Barbie, VHS and video games. So what are you about?"" There was a huge educational component. Then you had journalists who had magazines and lead time and jockeying for position on the cover. And there was no internet to speak of. So a trade show at that time of year for this nascent industry was exactly what we needed to do. Now we have an event in February called Destination PlayStation, where we bring all retailers and third-party partners to come hear the story for the year. They're making purchasing discussions in February. June, now, is just too late to have a Christmas holiday discussion with retailers. So retail has really dropped off. And journalists now, with the internet and the fact that 24/7 there is game news, it's lost its impact around that. So the trade show became a trade show without a lot of trade activity. The world has changed, but E3 hasn't necessarily changed with it. And with our decision to do fewer games -- bigger games -- over longer periods of time, we got to a point where June of 2019 was not a time for us to have a new thing to say. And we feel like if we ring the bell and people show up here in force, people have expectation ""Oh, they're going to tell us something."" We are progressing the conversation about, how do we transform E3 to be more relevant? Can E3 transition more into a fan festival of gaming, where we don't gather there to drop the new bomb? Can't it just be a celebration of games and have panels where we bring game developers closer to fans? https://www.cnet.com/news/sonys-shawn-layden-wants-fewer-bigger-playstation-games/",,Giamast,Italy,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

The future of game streaming is an open road. But we already have some markets we can use to draw a map: online video streaming services. If we’re not careful, game streaming will hit the same speed bumps.

As Microsoft, Sony, NVIDIA, Google, and others start to ramp up their game streaming subscription services, we can already see what the biggest problem for gamers will be: an increasingly fragmented selection. As platforms and consoles fight to get the biggest and best games on their streaming service, and only their streaming service, gamers will find that it’s impossible to play all the titles they want on just one of them. Not that this is anything new for the gaming industry, of course: it’s the good old-fashioned platform exclusivity problem, now spread out among more and more platforms.

Streaming Looms On The Horizon

To be clear about our terms: the “game streaming” in this article refers to playing video games in your home over a broadband connection, where the actual hardware that hosts the game (the PC or game console doing the number-crunching) is on a server somewhere.

Current examples include PlayStation Now, which streams a selection of PS2, PS3, and PS4 games to either a regular PS4 or a program running on your computer, NVIDIA GeForce NOW, which can stream full-power PC games to either the NVIDIA SHIELD set-top box or PCs, and Google’s Project Stream, which used a single PC game in a test run earlier this year.

We’re not talking about streaming video of someone else playing a game that you watch on a service like YouTube or Twitch.
NVIDIA
If you’re not familiar with it: game streaming is very cool. It enables someone with minimal hardware, like, say, a $200 SHIELD, to play games that are otherwise limited to a $1000 gaming PC. It doesn’t need local media or massive 50GB downloads, and a relatively small monthly charge can give you access to hundreds of games, a la the Netflix setup. Regarding pure hardware, the only real downer is that you need a solid broadband connection: most of these services recommend 25 Mbps, but I’ve found that they tend to stutter on anything less than 50.

With those pieces in place, the experience is pretty amazing. You can play games at maximum graphical settings with almost perfect sync, including the fastest multiplayer shooters or fighters. And it’s only going to get better and more available: Microsoft is heavily rumored to be developing a streaming-only version of the next Xbox console, the service of which would undoubtedly be available on Windows, too. Even Nintendo is dipping a toe in: the company is currently streaming some older titles to SHIELD owners in China. Predictably, Amazon is looking to get in on this action as well.

Here’s where the “but” comes in.

The Library Problem

Streaming video services are fighting tooth and nail to get original, exclusive content: Netflix’s has its high-profile Marvel series, conventional shows like Orange is the New Black, and even full theatrical movies like Bird Box. Hulu has exclusives like The Handmaid’s Tale and continuations like The Mindy Project. Amazon Prime video is home to shows like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Man in the High Castle.
Video services compete for exclusive shows like The Handmaid’s Tale. Hulu

If your using it with ""ds4 windows"" or something similar, disable it. The game supports ps4 controllers natively - no 360 emulation necessary. Or, go into the game options and double check everything is bound correctly. Try re-binding that button to another action and check if that works. Or... Maybe it is working but it doesn't look like it? There is an option to disable the effect that happens when you use witcher sense (though I've never tried it). If your using a PS3 controller, make sure you install the official PS3 driver from the playstation now app (yeah, it's the only way to get it, it will ask you to install it during the installation of playstation now). That will make steam register your ps3 controller correctly. In either case, go into your steam settings and ensure the steam is finding your controller as either a ps3 or ps4 controller, and not generic, x-input or 360 controller.",,Bilbo Laggins,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Cant activate witcher sense. please help!,,,

According to a newly-uncovered patent, the PlayStation 5 may be capable not only of playing souped-up next-generation titles, but also of emulating the PlayStation 4, PS3, PS2 and original PlayStation, aka the PSX.

The patent, numbered 2019-503013, was filed by the PS4’s lead architect Mark Cerny, and describes a process that would allow the next-gen CPU to “interpret” the the CPU of previous machines. It focusses on synchronisation errors – making sure that newer, more powerful hardware only sends required information from a game in response to a “call” from the title itself, rather than jumping the gun and overwriting data being held in RAM.

The last-gen battleground

The patent also discusses the possibility of simply including hardware chipsets that mimic older consoles in the cases where the legacy design is particularly difficult to emulate, as was the case with the PS2.

In the playground fights between PS4 and Xbox One players, the area of backwards compatibility has been a key one. The Xbox One has had extensive backwards compatibility with original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles for some time, and continues to grow its legacy library, with users needing merely to pop their old discs into the console to play.

The PS4 on the other hand has relied on its PlayStation Now streaming service, which requires the user pays a subscription fee and has a strong internet connection to stream old games over the internet. It’s had a mixed reception, and isn’t truly a replacement for dusting off your own, already-owned games.

This new patent, should Sony act upon its potential, shows the company is finally taking its back catalogue seriously. And with the PS4 still playing host to a mighty library of games, it would let new players hit the ground running with compatible PS5 titles right out of the box.

182792516002,2/13/2019,http://freqzandgeekz.tumblr.com/post/182792516002,"Nintendo Just Announced a Ton Of New Switch Games 
If you haven’t yet purchased a Nintendo Switch, then perhaps the deluge of announcements from Wednesday’s Nintendo Direct will change your mind.

During the video presentation, Nintendo announced a metric ton of new video games, remastered classic games, and a 99-player battle royale version of Tetris that promptly sent the Internet into a tizzy. Here’s are the biggest announcements that you missed during today’s reveal:

Super Mario Maker 2



Our long national nightmare of not being able to create our own custom Mario levels on the Switch is over. Super Mario Maker 2 is coming to the handheld console this June with a bunch of new tools, including diagonal slopes, which I promise is much more exciting than it sounds.

The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening

Originally released for the Game Boy back in 1993, the classic The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening is getting a 3D remake for the Switch that is so relentlessly charming that if you manage to make it through the trailer without smiling, you’re legally dead inside. The “modern reimagining” arrives sometime later this year.

Astral Chain



Scratch that itch for frenetic, futuristic cyberpunk chaos with ASTRAL CHAIN, the anime-style, third-person action game from Platinum Games and NieR: Automata game designer Takahisa Taura that has you teaming up with a living weapon known as Legion to fight all manner of monsters. The game, which drops August 30, looks like a combination of Patlabor and Devil May Cry, which are two tastes that look like they’ll taste great together. Plus you can apparently dress as a giant dog mascot and recycle? Sign me all the way up.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses



The good news is that there is a new Fire Emblem game about three noble houses–The Black Eagles, the Blue Lions, and the Golden Deer–that comprise an elite training academy where students are molded into warriors, mages, and specialists. You will become a professor leading the students of one of these houses through a series of tactical, grid-based battles with major life-or-death consequences. The bad news is that you have to wait until July 26 to play it.

Tetris 99



Who knew that Twitter was just champing at the bit to tear each other a new one in Tetris? Apparently, Nintendo did. Forget Apex Legends; the hottest new name in battle royale right now is Tetris 99, which as the title suggests is a 99-player competitive multiplayer version of Tetris. This Switch exclusive is free to play and available right now in the Nintendo eShop.

BOXBOY! + BOXGIRL!



On April 26, you and a friend can put your heads together for some co-op puzzle-solving action across 270 different levels in BoxBoy! + BoxGirl!.

Mortal Kombat 11



Get over here and play Mortal Kombat 11 on the go! The brutal fighting game is coming to the Switch on April 23. Prepare your body by brushing up on the deadly physics of the series in our new show, The Science of Mortal Kombat with Kyle Hill!

Final Fantasy IX



Originally released in 2000, the classic RPG is finally available on Nintendo Switch. If you slept on this back in the days of the first PlayStation, now is the time to fix the grievous error of your ways and enjoy its sprawling, fantasy worldbuilding right now. That’s right, the game is available immediately on the Nintendo eShop. And if you’re feeling nostalgic for a different PSX-era release, then hang tight because Final Fantasy VII hits the Switch on March 26.

Assassin’s Creed III Remastered



Relive the thrills and chills of the American Revolution on the go with this fully remastered version of Assassin’s Creed III coming to the Switch on May 21. With revamped gameplay, improved aiming, and all of the game’s original DLC included, it’s a no-brainer for action-adventure fans.

In addition to the aforementioned titles, Nintendo also revealed release dates for a slew of other games (Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order comes this summer), provided updates on DLC for Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Persona 5‘s Joker arrives in April!), and much more, which you can find in the complete Nintendo Direct presentation on Nintendo’s website.

While linear and chapter-based, they really show how to still do that in modern times; something Valve could've taken to heart for the Half-Life series, if they gave a damn about making games any more. The atmosphere is hauntingly beautiful; also, I didn't appreciate how much of a horror game it could be. Especially the ""Spider Lair"" DLC, which really made my heart race. Obviously I'm doing this in preparation of Metro Exodus releasing in a couple weeks. ====================::==================== So, I finished God of War II; by finished I do mean the same thing I meant when I said I finished the original God of War, namely that I played a substantial portion, hit a wall near the end and watched a playthrough of the rest of the game. As with the original God of War, I started using an actual disc on my PS2 and, after that froze about a third of the way through the game, I switched to PSNow and progressed quite a bit further. I’m definitely down to say it’s quite a bit better than the first game. It kind of just gets everything better. The story is more emotionally complex and resonant; the idea that Kratos is trying to escape his fate adds a lot to what could easily have been just another revenge story. The idea of the threads of fate is great and it’s all really for that moment when Spoiler Kratos stares down Zeus and Zeus says something to the effect of, “The Sisters of Fate aid you.” And Kratos just growls, “The Sisters are DEAD.” That’s just awesome. In that vein, all the bosses are way better. I particularly loved the Barbarian King showing up; that was a “oh ****” moment when you realize who that guy is. There’s a later boss fight that is really artistically done. It’s filmed like you’re in a sidescroller with Kratos and the unidentified person he’s fighting seen completely in silhouette against an orange sky. The Steeds of Time are really beautiful as well, but that fight scene is, even for a series this beautiful to look at, a big step forward in terms of artistic visuals. Also, I felt like the first God of War spent about a third of its running time inside the Temple of Pandora and I found that section to be really repetitive. This game goes out of its way to vary the environments and it does a much better job than the first game which, after the first act in Athens, becomes pretty samey. The power-ups are better too. Tython’s Bane, the bow-and-arrow combo is a phenomenal power-up. I’m a sucker for ranged weapons in predominately melee games and when they auto-aim, well, where do I lay my money down? Being able to move with the bow ready and drawn was so much fun. Just dropping into a shoulder roll and then coming up with the bow ready and then strafing around a corner with it . . . was so cool. And it ups the “massive a-hole” levels on Kratos too, which I support. At one point, Kratos needs to stop a machine made of up of turning gears. He picks up a wounded soldier and, as the soldier begs for help, throws him into the gears. It’s worth mentioning that there are actual dead bodies scattered about. But, no, our “hero” has to pick the one guy that’s alive and throw him screaming into the gears. Classic. I will say that this is the dumbest looking boss I've encountered in quite some time. Oh, yes, I also forgot. The grappling is amazing. I have no idea why there aren't a million gifs of Kratos grappling in this game. He swings horizontally in a circle! Anyway, I think I'm going to get the next game and try it out on PSP. It's Chains of Olympus, I think. After that I'll probably take a break from the franchise. But it's super-fun still.",,Rogue1-and-a-half,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,JCC - Förceboat Parté - JC G4m3z thr34d | Page 116,,,

That division is the largest contributor to the company's operating income at more than 30 percent."" Click to expand... I feel like this is the sort of thing that could make them be more cautious about spending on next generation in terms of not feeding the egos of internet warriors, and instead again approaching the console budget with Fiscal Responsibility™ ala PS4. PS4 is somewhat running into a pure sales number issue since they've effectively hit PS3's 8 year sales numbers in the span of ~5. That's a bit of a problem for growth as it is becoming very difficult to cost reduce, and well, maybe the bean counters took a look at the PS3 sales data post-2013, and it just wouldn't be realistic to expect the same legs as PS2 to taper off the generation. So how much more could they expect to grow the userbase even with a meager price reduction? Furthermore, that's the sort of very long term planning that may have implications for next generation - assuming they similarly sell very well, and there's no particular good reason to think otherwise for the time being - in that sense, how much do they *really* need to spend to sell to their considerable fanbase when it's about hitting that sweet spot. Someone with more knowledge about the projections for global economy or just big markets such as the US or UK (*ahem*) might chime in about possible consumer spending habits (although certainly in rough times, the need to be entertained is much higher). Sony could just pour more effort into 4Pro now that their plans have been pushed back, and perhaps it would actually be worthwhile to shift to 7nm since there can be overlap in sales between 4Pro and existing PS4 owners, not just trying to find new folks to sell to beyond the 90 million mark. The next question is how long that lasts and how it might fit into the next gen transition may or may not be tricky considering the nature of 4Pro's price point. R&D for 7nm could be amortized to some extent between 4ProSlim and 4SKim anyway. We've discussed elsewhere the implications and possibilities for switching memory types as well. /rant ====================::==================== Gaming division revenue up 10% YoY. But the division profit dropped 14% YoY. Uh.. Next gen investment impact, and they said they were accelerating PSNow deployment? Should it start being visible in the financials now or is the r&d investment usually showing up earlier or later or just invisible? Different columns?

After that whole Gamergate mess, I rather became disillusioned with games media in general, and really just kept away for a few years, just to clear my head. Hopefully I'll be able to get back in the groove, but it seems that, outside the fringes at least, we can get back to talking about video-games again, and that's what I'm in for. And what a time to talk about games! Microsoft has announced that they're bringing Xbox Live services to Android, iOS and Switch, and while it's VERY unlikely that you'll be able to use their services to play online on Switch in lieu of Nintendo's, it does seem a portent of things to come. It's no secret that the Xbox One has not enjoyed great success worldwide, only selling 41.4 million units since it launched in late 2013, putting it in a pathetic spot against the PS4 (92.2 million), and with the Switch, a console that came out in 2017, looming closer in the rear view mirror than Microsoft would like (30.3 million). Let's not mince words here, the Xbox One is a failure, especially outside North America. While it's no surprise that Japan laughs at the idea of buying a Microsoft consoles, Europe isn't exactly embracing MS either, and the market that carried Sony through the tough first half of the PS3's lifespan has remained a stalwart ally during this generation as well. Honestly, I'd go so far as to say that the Xbox 360 was a fluke. Had Sony not essentially sacrificed the PS3 to win the HD movie format war, the Xbox 360 would likely have sold somewhere between the OG Xbox's numbers and the numbers the Xbox One has now. The PS3's initial failures allowed MS to leapfrog Sony in North America and actually hold onto Europe for a while, forcing Japanese third parties in particular to stop ignoring the platform, which gave them a whole lot more parity in game selection. Now? That parity is gone. Microsoft's mostly getting only the surefire hits from Namco, Square-Enix (with the obvious exception of the Eidos games, where MS still gets parity) and Capcom, while the rest of the Japanese development community focuses mostly on the PS4 and Switch, with the occasional token Xbone port. And make no mistake, even if you don't play Japanese games, this is a big issue, because it highlights the real issue with Xbox One - a DIRE lack of reason to buy the thing. You're not going to get Activision and EA to make games exclusively to Xbox One OR PS4, so they're not really a reason TO buy an Xbox One instead of a PS4. Halo is in decline judging by 5, and Gears 4 suggests we've seen that franchise's peak as well. There's Forza, yeah, but it's not like quality racing games are hard to find on either platform, and Crackdown? Crackdown 3 is NOT showing what the prolonged development period was for. Meanwhile, Sony and Nintendo are pumping out exclusives that keep knocking sales and perception out the park, with Nintendo finally getting it in their heads that they actually have to make games and not just party favors. Say what you will about Nintendo, they've learned at least that lesson from the Wii U's failure well. So that leads us to today. While Sony does have PlayStation Now, they're not pimping it NEARLY as much as Microsoft is pimping Xbox Game Pass. Instead, Sony continues to amaze and astound with new and established IP alike, while Nintendo returns to making stellar evergreen games. Microsoft? It seems every bit of good news about them involves other platforms, be it playing Fortnite and Minecraft with PC and Switch players, or indeed their Xbox initiative for the rival Nintendo switch. Sea of Thieves was a hot mess, State of Decay 2 was a non-event and Crackdown 3 looks like the best Xbox 360 game of the year. Where's the excitement for playing Xbox games on Xbox, that you can't play on platforms that aren't Xbox? There just seems to be this overwhelming feeling of... surrender. Microsoft just looks like they're ready to wave the white flag. The company as a whole is profitable, but it's no secret that the Xbox division has been an albatross around the company's neck for most of its existence. With PC having reached maturation as a market and MS Office remaining the dominant office suite, Microsoft's issue isn't profit, but growth. The Xbox hasn't really helped the company grow, and while I personally like Bing, let's not act like it's putting a dent in Google's hold on the search engine market. While it moves into cloud services to fight Amazon, I'm not sure it can keep this game console lark going for much longer. Unless the next generation Xbox lights the world on fire, what does Microsoft really see happening? Do they just turn Xbox into a PC game streaming service? Not sure how viable that would be for fast-paced action games outside of the US' major coastal centers, but it's not like Xbox has really ever been a global phenomenon. Honestly, I can see them turning inward, making more PC games, putting out the surefire stuff on Sony or Nintendo platforms while the rest is just PC/Game Pass. Maybe put out a game pass streaming box, try to be Onlive 2.0. However, Microsoft can't just keep making consoles that lose money the way they've been doing. Personally, I hate the idea of losing a manufacturer, and the competition that it brings. While MS' contributions to gaming have sometimes been detrimental (pay for online, microtransactions, et al), they proved to be a successful check against Sony's hubris, keeping core gaming going while Nintendo went off the deep end with the Wii. However, for the Xbox, as a distinct bit of hardware, to be a viable contender, they need to make their own platform exciting again, and that means a massive investment in first/second party games. The Xbox needs its' definitive games, more than just Halo and Gears, that really make people say ""I need to get an Xbox."" While they focus on spreading Live everywhere, though, I don't see it happening.",,YukoAsho,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

If Akuma was paid dlc in Tekken 7, I’d have paid full price for him. I also paid for Geese. The other canon Tekken characters that were DLC; no. That’s the power of an appealing guest character. I don't really play Tekken so my answer would be super biased but I do agree that a good guest can really build hype for the game. I was super excited for Predator in Mortal Kombat X. I can't say I'd have felt the same if they announced Darrius or Dairou as DLC for the game. In Soulcalibur 5, I almost exclusively used Ezio and I use Geralt a bunch in Soulcalibur 6. As a fan of The Walking Dead and someone who doesn't play Tekken, I'll admit that Negan's reveal had me interested. Akuma in Tekken 7 was cool as well, and I exclusively used him when Tekken 7 was free for the weekend on Xbox. I'd be lying if I said I didn't redownload Mortal Kombat 9 on PS3 (after already owning it on Xbox 360) when I had a month of PSNow so that I could try out Kratos. I'm not saying that Street Fighter 5 100% should have guest characters, but the right guest characters could really help benefit the game. I understand why hardcore fans don't want them, but they can really help draw in more people like me who otherwise might not have checked the game out. Soulcalibur is one of my favorite fighting games now, and one of the only fighters I still play these days, and it all started because I wanted to try out Spawn in Soulcalibur 2. A good guest in Street Fighter 5 could help turn a casual into a future hardcore fan. Of course, that's just my opinion.",,ssj5goku2005,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

The last time I tried Now, it didn't seem like the interface changed at all from the first time I used it. It wasn't a surprise. It was a calculated business decision. They forsaw how tech would change the market, and made preemptive moves to capitalize off of it before their competitors. It served them well, but overall, I do not like this direction. It depends on advanced infrastructure, which lol, requires economic and social planning -- something next to impossible in our current economic context on the entire globe.

There should always be the option to own the software you buy though if you have the proprietary hardware for it. @Pedro said: Sony fannies are already freaking out. LMAO.

Gibson shows kids their future by introducing them to their past. In 2013, she founded Because Of Them We Can, a platform that teaches kids about the black excellence in history ― and in the present ― that they typically don’t learn about in school or in the media. Starting out as a photo series, Jones has been able to expand the brand by making facts about the giants of black history accessible for parents, educators and everyone else. 

She approaches the brand by doing things “the Woodson way,” looking to the father of Black History Month, Carter G. Woodson for inspiration. Gibson is reclaiming the limited narrative society has given black history by attacking revisionism head-on with facts that show our story is not monolithic.

As a part of HuffPost Black Voices’ “We Built This” series, Gibson spoke to us about founding “Because Of Them We Can,” her new subscription box and the role education plays in showing black kids their potential.  

What have you built?

I built Because of Them We can, a platform and an ongoing campaign to highlight black history and excellence on a consistent basis. 

Because of Them We Can started as a photo series and grew. What was that idea, the inception, behind this and calling it Because of Them We Can?

For so long we’ve said we stand on the shoulders of giants. To me, Because of Them We Can is a way to capture that sentiment and to make it real for anyone. It started with me as a mother of two black boys knowing they’ll grow to be black men and really wanting to create content and imagery that could surround them and help them to build their self-esteem by rooting it in their history and where they come from and the DNA that they are inextricably tied to and that there’s greatness in that DNA.

There are so many things that have been erased from our history. What has been your experience in witnessing kids seeing these photos and these campaigns you’ve distributed with Because of Them We Can?

Seeing the kids respond to the imagery is probably the best part of doing this type of work because they’re excited to learn about people that they’ve never heard of. They’re excited to understand that they’re connected to these individuals. The kids who stand in as these people, as well as the kids that are observing and are consuming the content. It’s the reason why we’ve gone back to the kids when it comes to the subscription boxes and trying to give kids a way to actually touch and feel history beyond Black History Month.

When did you realize that this needed to be more than just a digital brand?

The campaign started in February of 2013. Before the month ended I knew that it was more than just a photo series, so much so that I quit my job. Six years later, we find ourselves in a position where it’s very clear that we need content like this not just online, not just on the internet, not just on a digital space. When you interact with young people and you see them sort of disconnected from who they are and where they come from, we realized that there was a greater opportunity to extend the content offline. We started doing things like going into the classrooms and leveraging my book to teach them about these history-makers by showing them other kids who posed as the same individuals that we were teaching them about. From there we realized, you know what? There’s a real opportunity to scale this and to grow it and to really get kids to understand that we should be talking about black history and black excellence daily because black history is made daily. Black excellence appears daily. We embody it and we exude it. The only way that we can continue is if we continue to make that the narrative in what we’re talking about.

There’s a lot of hope that goes into your work. I’m thinking about in 2013 when you started, it seemed to be, even though we’ve always had a lot of misfortune and plenty of instances of police brutality —that was a year after Black Lives Matter was founded — all these things were happening. Still, it seemed to be a bit easier to grasp on to that hope to instill the kids. How has that evolved or changed, especially now that it feels harder than ever to grasp onto hope?

Yeah. When the campaign started it was definitely rooted in hope. This idea that there is better, there is more. We just aren’t talking about it. We just aren’t lifting it up. That was also right when Trayvon Martin’s murderer was acquitted. It was like, what can we do to really just get people excited and to change the narrative. The narrative at that time, although we had a black president was also very negative. It was still very stereotypical. This was a way to kind of refute that by injecting some hope, some joy, some good energy into the conversation. You’re right. It was very easy for people to grasp it and to run with it because they, too, saw an absence of that type of content. Right now, given the world that we live in, it’s far more important that we maintain this campaign and that we continue to build this content because our beauty, our existence, our relevance, our significance, our contributions, are consistently being challenged.

You have a young African-American man, or young boy, who was told to cut his hair so that he could wrestle. You have his teammates encouraging the act so that they could win a match when it was at the expense of his dignity. This type of content is because those types of instances seem to happen far too often now than they were happening four years ago, or eight years ago. People have been almost gassed up to do things of that nature. It’s definitely rooted in hope. It’s targeting young black children. Everyone can consume it, but this is a campaign that’s really built to help young black children know that they’re seen, that they’re valuable, that they’re wanted, that they’re special, and that there are people who have worked really hard to make it so that they can pursue whatever their wildest dream may be. I love that.

Your kids must think you’re so cool.

They do. Last night I asked my six-year-old … He gave me a kiss on my cheek and he was like, “I love you mom.” I was like, “Oh, I love you too.” I was like, “Are you glad I’m your mom?” My ten-year-old is like, “Who wouldn’t be?” I was like, “Oh, okay. Okay. Good answer. Good answer. Go down and load a game for your Play Station now. You guys have earned that with the flattery. I appreciate it.”

The digital properties, of course, are super important. I mean, four-year-olds have iPhones now. Also, I think it’s really vital that you have this tangible presence, especially now through your subscription box. Why did you decide to incorporate that and what’s in the boxes?

The digital content, we know that adults are really consuming it whether it’s a story about black excellence or the content that we’re creating. We also consistently get emails. People reach out to me and say, “I’m showing my students the videos that you’ve made. They’re great. Can you make more?” When I was going into the school systems, and I was talking to some of the parents and the teachers, they were saying, “We need more content. We need more material like this.” I really just started to think more about those conversations because I knew I couldn’t replicate myself. Right? I knew it would be very difficult to just, at one time, send out the same message to all of these different schools or children.

It was like, do you know what? A subscription box. This would give every child whose parent has ever emailed and said, “Can my kid be in your campaign?” “Oh, my gosh, my child loves Spike Lee.” “Oh, my gosh, my child needs to know about Zora Neale Hurston.” Whatever the case may be, it gives them the opportunity to make it real for them in their own home on a consistent basis. Every single month there’s a theme for Black History Month. It is the Because of Carter G. Woodson Box. That box revolves around Carter G. Woodson and his life and whatever is going on in the world.

February is also Valentines’ Day so the kids, for instance, in this box, because he created the Journal of Negro History, they get a journal of my history where they get to personalize it for themselves. They get Valentine’s Day cards where it says, “You are your ancestor’s wildest dream and mine too.” Or, “Wishing you love, peace, and soul.” Then they also get collectible pins and toys and props that allow them to really take on the likeness of this individual and go through activities that are in the box to understand who this person is and why they need to know who they are. The box is a way to teach black history through a theme every single month and give the kids apparel, toys, props, and tools to really make it real. It’s for all children. It’s not just for black children. It’s for all children to consume so they can learn this information.

So much that we know about ourselves, has been erased and left out of textbooks, left out of even Black History Month or black history celebrations in general. I think about how excited kids are to see themselves reflected in Mae Jemison or these other giants of black history. For those who may not understand the gravity of what it means to take pride in your history, can you explain why it’s important for black kids to see themselves reflected in history?

It’s important for black kids to see themselves reflected in history and reflected in the present day from the right lens. What happens is black children see themselves reflected all the time. They see images of themselves all the time, but those images aren’t always positive. Those images aren’t always accurate or uplifting. It’s important for them to see themselves in a light that we know is true for them. It’s important for black kids to see themselves as doctors, as lawyers, as engineers, as creatives and artists, as trailblazers, as the builders of this country that we know we are.

It’s important that they understand that and that they see it.

It’s important for me to create the type of content that will help them to not just feel it but know it and know who these individuals are. Know who Carter G. Woodson was or George Washington Carver or Zora Neale Hurston or Harriet Tubman or Mae Jemison or some of the other people that we’re still learning about. We’re still uncovering hidden figures today. It’s extremely important because it will help them to really understand their power and their potential. We will have less children of ours who are lost as a result.

What do you remember about learning about our history when you were a child?

I remember Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I remember Rosa Parks. I remember Harriet Tubman and I remember slaves. That’s it. When I was a child, our history in schools and in textbooks was relegated to those narratives and those individuals. While I appreciate the accomplishments and the trails that have been blazed by those individuals, I also recognize that there is so much more to our history than just those people. Our history also didn’t begin with slavery. That’s something that I want to change. That’s something that so many people want to change. I look at Because of Them We Can as a platform and a tool to actually do that.

Who are the black history makers, the ancestors, the elders, who you look to who continue to inspire your work?

The elders that I look to first are in my own home. It would be my grandparents. It would be Maxine Jefferson and Burnetta Jones and Raymond Jones. It would be my family. Beyond my family, it’s individuals like Carter G. Woodson. I believe that we should do things the Woodson way. That’s really to know our contributions, know our history, know what we’re doing, and make sure that other people know and that we never stop talking about it so that black history becomes this thing that we’re doing, and we’re uplifting and we’re talking about on a 365-day basis. There are individuals that are presently living and walking that continue to inspire me like your Debbie Allens, or your Oprah Winfreys, your Ava DuVernays. Spike Lee is somebody that I’m really inspired by because I believe he took a very creative and nontraditional approach to bringing certain conversations to the forefront. He continues to do that. He would probably be one of my biggest inspirations today that’s currently walking the earth.

Then, of course, our Forever FLOTUS. Our 44, of course, continues to inspire and to really just show us what’s possible, to really show us what grace under fire looks like, to really show us what black excellence looks like. That’s an example that I’m so happy that we have. It’s an example that up until eight years ago never existed on a platform like we saw it, but it was in our everyday lives. We had our own little examples of President Barack Obama or Michelle Obama in our individual lives. There are community members and people in schools and neighborhoods who are excellent just like they are. I’m happy that they were put on a platform to make it very clear that it exists.

When it’s all said and done, what do you want to accomplish with Because of Them We Can?

The “can.” When it’s all said and done what I want to accomplish with Because of Them We Can is for people to understand who the “them” are. That we can do anything that we put our minds to. When it’s all said and done, Because of Them We Can, I want young black children to feel empowered, to be inspired, and to feel like there are no limitations on whatever it is they aspire to do or to become.  I want other people of different races to really recognize and understand all that we’ve built and the power that exists within our community and to, for once, put a hold and a pause on all the false narratives.

They are against cross-play and true backwards compatibility in favor of PlayStation Now. At least with Microsoft backwards compatibility is true and free. On top of that, Microsoft exclusive games are PC and Xbox compatible. You cannot even play God of War 4 on the computer without using some kind of illegal means. So despite how Microsoft operates, they are most definitely pro-consumer. Sony has had crossplay longer and more often than Microsoft, I like how you won't quote what I've already written ITT on the subject of Cross-play. Microsoft is using cross-play as a GaaS trick, that's why XBone doesn't have any true exclusives like Sony does. https://imgtc.com/GiRErkI.jpg",,8SaintWanderer,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

PlayStation Now: New Games for February 2019 Revealed





 PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming subscription service, which is designed for fans of the PlayStation family’s huge gaming catalog. Not to be confused with the PlayStation Plus membership club (which has its own separate library of playable titles), PlayStation Now allows users to stream and/or download a vast number of PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 games on either their PS4 or laptops.

In terms of pricing, the official PlayStation website will sell you a membership for $19.99 per month, $44.99 for three months, or $99.99 for the year. It is also possible, at the moment to try out the service with a 7-day free trial (if you can’t afford the payments, don’t forget to cancel your membership before the end of the trial period!). You can also pick up a membership on Amazon.

Each month, new games are added to the PlayStation Now library. Here’s what’s available this month:

Metal Gear Solid HD Collection

If you’ve ever wanted to jump into the twisted sci-fi world of Metal Gear Solid, then Metal Gear Solid HD Collection is a good place to start. A celebration of the franchise’s long history, this boxset comes packed with almost every main installment released to date, including the original Metal Gear games released for the MSX in the ’80s. The full list also includes Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 as well as Peacewalker, the excellent handheld precursor to Metal Gear Solid V. Note that there’s an even more complete edition of this HD re-release with more games called the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection on Amazon for $24.



Mortal Kombat X 

It’s time to test your might, fighting fans! Mortal Kombat X is the latest release in the gory fighting franchise. It features all new fighters as well as new takes on classic characters. An insane story involving multiple realms and a civil war for total dominance ties all of these fighters together in a battle that will decide the fate of Earthrealm. You’ll also get to play as a few bonus characters if you pick up the season pass, including the Xenomorph from Alien and Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is a perfect way to prepare yourself for Mortal Kombat 11! If you’d prefer a physical copy of this gorefest, you can pick one up for $19 on Amazon. 

PlayStation Now: Other New Games

Battlefield Hardline (PS3)

Earth Defense Force 4.1 (PS4)

F1 2017 (PS4)

Magicka 2 (PS4)

Metro Last Light Redux (PS4)

Need for Speed Rivals (PS3)

Pillars of Eternity (PS4)

Rebel Galaxy (PS4)

That’s all, folks! We’ll keep this list updated as Sony adds more games to PlayStation Now. Until then, check out what’s free this month on PlayStation Plus!",,champagne-stress,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,PlayStation Now: New Games for February 2019 Revealed,Post,,

That division is the largest contributor to the company's operating income at more than 30 percent."" Click to expand... I feel like this is the sort of thing that could make them be more cautious about spending on next generation in terms of not feeding the egos of internet warriors, and instead again approaching the console budget with Fiscal Responsibility™ ala PS4. PS4 is somewhat running into a pure sales number issue since they've effectively hit PS3's 8 year sales numbers in the span of ~5. That's a bit of a problem for growth as it is becoming very difficult to cost reduce, and well, maybe the bean counters took a look at the PS3 sales data post-2013, and it just wouldn't be realistic to expect the same legs as PS2 to taper off the generation. So how much more could they expect to grow the userbase even with a meager price reduction? Furthermore, that's the sort of very long term planning that may have implications for next generation - assuming they similarly sell very well, and there's no particular good reason to think otherwise for the time being - in that sense, how much do they *really* need to spend to sell to their considerable fanbase when it's about hitting that sweet spot. Someone with more knowledge about the projections for global economy or just big markets such as the US or UK (*ahem*) might chime in about possible consumer spending habits (although certainly in rough times, the need to be entertained is much higher). Sony could just pour more effort into 4Pro now that their plans have been pushed back, and perhaps it would actually be worthwhile to shift to 7nm since there can be overlap in sales between 4Pro and existing PS4 owners, not just trying to find new folks to sell to beyond the 90 million mark. The next question is how long that lasts and how it might fit into the next gen transition may or may not be tricky considering the nature of 4Pro's price point. R&D for 7nm could be amortized to some extent between 4ProSlim and 4SKim anyway. We've discussed elsewhere the implications and possibilities for switching memory types as well. /rant ====================::==================== MrFox said: ↑ Uh.. Next gen investment impact, and they said they were accelerating PSNow deployment? Should it start being visible in the financials now or is the r&d investment usually showing up earlier or later or just invisible? Different columns? Click to expand... PSNow is in the most expensive server resource deployment stage which contributes toward the apparanent revenue/profit discrepancy beyond the global economic slowdown.

Pros: A lot faster than the PS3 in general Tons of free games Playstation Now is a pretty decent deal and has a wide selection Tons of media apps like netflix, hulu, amazon video, funimation, etc... Controller allows you to change brightness of glow Tons of customization options to suit your console to you (including high contrast) Playstation plus seems to offer better deals for digital. Cons: No more composite output, which means I cannott get audio through my pc the easy way When you are downloading many items there can be menu lag Some apps tend to glitch and close application isn't an option. However, you can easily just restart. I got this because I had no reason to get the PS4 Pro, I don't have a 4K TV nor do I really care about 4K Gaming (and the 6-8 games that are supported for 4K on the Pro.) Honestly I just found this to be a better deal, as the Pro just seems to be a lazy cashgrab. It definitely is slim and fits into pretty much any keyboard space.

If someone can't afford a game at full price, they wont buy it no matter the store it is sold. Others would wait anyway for bugs to be sorted out or DLC to be released to get a full package. See /r/patientgamers . I'd argue those sales coupled with regional pricing(?) is what moved some people away from pirating games. Lower sales per game in this case beat no sales, I would assume. I'm assuming Steam Sales became such a meme just because there were no other stores at the time. I fail to see how Steam could be held responsible though, since it's the dev/publisher that decides for how deep their games can go on sale. > I would like to play God of War on PC, but guess what I won't.

Netflix isn't free just because you bought a device that has built-into it. This service will cost to stream. More than likely Mcirosoft will tie it to either on or both their current gaming services. Tie it to Live Gold for that stream everyhing you own option. And Game Pass offering the ability to stream anything from that catalog. Free just seems like a bad idea financially in the long run for Microsoft. The service has to make revenue somehow. Your option adds no benefit to MS bottom line if most of those game sales would have happened whether XCloud existed or not. I think Game Pass will definitely include it. That is a service, like XCloud, thst MS has said will jump platforms and be PC based as well. I further don't see why they wouldn't want to seek those subscription dollars from mobile users via streaming as well. MS would have to add it just to make sure PSNow doesn't have that streaming advantage over the MS service. XBox Live stream what you own option I presented is great for Xbox owners that is for sure. But, as for mass consumption outside of XBox I don't see it as important mainly because the biggest draw for Gold is online play which doesn't exist for other platforms. It may get some people to buy Xbox games that don't own an Xbox in order to stream them to a phone or other device but, I don't think that would be a large percentage of users.",,imgumbydammit2,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

No money spent and alot of trading and this year I have one of the best teams in the game. I wanted to start a RTG on Playstation now, but I feel it's too late in the year to gain any interest. With declining gameplay, i'm starting to wonder if there would be any point as people might not feel inclined to watch fifa content or even read it Just want to see what you guys think? Go for it now or leave it for next year? ====================::==================== Quote: : » IMO it's fairly easy this year to grind fast towards an effective team which costs a couple 100k. If you put the efford in to grind squad battles to gold 1 and get div 5 rank 3 ivals weekly you'll make like 50k+ each week easily. So if you're up for the grind deffo give it a try. it'll be fun to see what you can achieve. As for myself, I already have gotten Top 100 in WL and I'm not trying to be a pro player so as far as playing WL on xbox, I'm done with that lol. yeah basically just seeing if anyone would be interested in it, whether it be posting videos or forum posts updating stuff. I feel like interest in the game has died down so I guess idk I love starting fresh and the grinds always fun",,Yoshi,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,M,,,,Question for my ps4 ppl?,,,

Freezes and crashes? LOL. I mean sure, they occur, but compared to PC...lulz. At least on console, when a game crashes, it's either a freak occurrence, or a universal glitch that is corrected with a universal patch that works on all machines. When a game crashes on PC, you gotta bring out the big book of ""One Billion Reasons Why Your Game Might've Crashed"" , and troubleshoot the problem yourself. Forced updates? Who cares? You're telling me you don't have to update all the components of PC regularly? LOL. As for data vulnerability, I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't see one worse than the other, except for with PC, there are far more avenues for hackers to steal your shit. It's nothing I've ever worried about on either though, so whatever. Yeah, the exclusives on consoles are far better than the exclusives on PC. Also, developers are now thinking console first, which is why PC gets so many piss poor versions that have way more problems than their console counterparts. Click to expand... I've had both and I've had issues with both PC and console. My PC has been great no issues with anything if a game crashes it's no different than PS4 I restart it. In fact out of the two my PS4 has caused me more issues because my PS4 stopped reading disk and there's no way to fix that so I'm kind of pissed about that.Then again I work in IT so any PC issues, replacing\upgrading is very easy for me. As far as exclusives only Sony has an advantage IMO. Nintendos exclusives your not really missing much hell you can play the Zelda game on PC easily and it's looks gorgeous.

I am in the beta for PSnow in europe and i wanted to try out Battle Chasers Nightwar and since its on PS4 you can actually download it. I noticed that the game is in 30 fps but i looked it up and apparently theres a patch for it on PS4 pro that makes the game 60 fps, i have a ps4 pro. Now i am wondering if i cant take mart in these enhancements because im playing it trough PSnow. Thanks! ====================::==================== 1 hour ago, Bilenlol said: I have to scroll down abit trough the update history but that part is there. this is weird Edit: It says ""combat, world map and menus"". Does this include the starting area? Cause when i entered combat the first time 60 fps got enabled. It might just be me thinking the starting area being the world map. Never played the game but I assume the world map is not where you are playing, but simply just the Map, UI and in combat.

I've tried a ton of games on PSNow including stuff like Bloodborne, Steep, racing games, precise platformers, etc, and I can't notice any input lag at all even if I try to look for it. That said, you need good internet with not just good bandwidth but low and stable latency and you need to understand that if you live in a house with a other people watching youtube and netflix, playing other games, downloading stuff, etc... then you may have some(or a lot, just depends on your internet setup) input lag.

No money spent and alot of trading and this year I have one of the best teams in the game. I wanted to start a RTG on Playstation now, but I feel it's too late in the year to gain any interest. With declining gameplay, i'm starting to wonder if there would be any point as people might not feel inclined to watch fifa content or even read it Just want to see what you guys think? Go for it now or leave it for next year? ====================::==================== IMO it's fairly easy this year to grind fast towards an effective team which costs a couple 100k. If you put the efford in to grind squad battles to gold 1 and get div 5 rank 3 ivals weekly you'll make like 50k+ each week easily.

That division is the largest contributor to the company's operating income at more than 30 percent."" Click to expand... I feel like this is the sort of thing that could make them be more cautious about spending on next generation in terms of not feeding the egos of internet warriors, and instead again approaching the console budget with Fiscal Responsibility™ ala PS4. PS4 is somewhat running into a pure sales number issue since they've effectively hit PS3's 8 year sales numbers in the span of ~5. That's a bit of a problem for growth as it is becoming very difficult to cost reduce, and well, maybe the bean counters took a look at the PS3 sales data post-2013, and it just wouldn't be realistic to expect the same legs as PS2 to taper off the generation. So how much more could they expect to grow the userbase even with a meager price reduction? Furthermore, that's the sort of very long term planning that may have implications for next generation - assuming they similarly sell very well, and there's no particular good reason to think otherwise for the time being - in that sense, how much do they *really* need to spend to sell to their considerable fanbase when it's about hitting that sweet spot. Someone with more knowledge about the projections for global economy or just big markets such as the US or UK (*ahem*) might chime in about possible consumer spending habits (although certainly in rough times, the need to be entertained is much higher). Sony could just pour more effort into 4Pro now that their plans have been pushed back, and perhaps it would actually be worthwhile to shift to 7nm since there can be overlap in sales between 4Pro and existing PS4 owners, not just trying to find new folks to sell to beyond the 90 million mark. The next question is how long that lasts and how it might fit into the next gen transition may or may not be tricky considering the nature of 4Pro's price point. R&D for 7nm could be amortized to some extent between 4ProSlim and 4SKim anyway. We've discussed elsewhere the implications and possibilities for switching memory types as well. /rant ====================::==================== MrFox said: ↑ Uh.. Next gen investment impact, and they said they were accelerating PSNow deployment? Should it start being visible in the financials now or is the r&d investment usually showing up earlier or later or just invisible? Different columns? Click to expand...

I know people bitched about the original plan for XBONE to have strong DRM which made swapping games inpossible, then forced them to change that. Your other posts made it more clear you want something for nothing and feels you're entitled to getting something for nothing. This might surprise you but the companies that make video games DO need to pay their employees, who in turn need to be able to provide for their families. Not that you care, just saying. The Industry is in it to make money first and foremost. That hasn't changed at all since first video games. The only thing that's changed is after the ET Fiasco almost killed the industry back in the early 80s, the industry started setting and raising standards and expectations. I'll stop the history lesson there but that's where it began. ...Yeah, and it's why gaming companies known for making console games have been getting into the mobile market in recent years. They're targeting casuals and non-gamers who may not be familiar with them more or less. Bethesda's Fallout Shelter is arguably the most engaging F2P on the mobile market. You can enjoy all the features without spending a dime, too (resource management gets easier once you pass 10 floors). Back on topic, I do think digital only consoles are inevitable. The Classic Console Niche (NES, SNES and PS1) is an experiment in that regard to me. So was the PSP Go, which was a Digital Only handheld. I do remember hearing rumors when the PS4 Pro was in development that Sony was looking into making a digital-only variant of the PS4 that would have more storage to compensate. There are several challenges that would need to be worked out before console makers can go all-in with Digital Only game systems. The two biggest ones for me are prevention of data loss and storage space personally. Again: Why do you have the unrealistic expectation--and the audacity in my boook--you feel you're entitled to play console games for free just because you don't want to pay for it because reasons? Obviously you're referring to piracy but if that's what you wanna do, meh. Speaking of, have you not heard of Playstation Now? It's Streaming Service you can use to play PS4 games without actually buying them. You pay a monthly subscription instead. So...yeah. Going all digital is taking away the option of lending games which was something we could do for 3 decades, that sounds like a loss any way you look at it.",,Unholyground,Canada,Ontario,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

None of what you is said is true. Sony has had a functional Cloud based gaming service for 5 years straight. Microsoft hasn't even started the race... @Jacanuk said: @lundy86_4 said: Link. It's quite clear that cloud gaming will become a threat... It's where we're heading. It's largely why Sony needs to address that aspect... Plan for cloud platforms on lackluster hardware. They bought and integrated Gaikai for a reason. Hmm, not sure how it would be a threat, it´s not like streaming music or movies which you can do from a toaster or a 10-year-old iPhone. Cloud gaming requires a fast internet connection and also pretty decent hardware to make it anything you would expect on a console. So we are at least a decade or two away from Cloud gaming being anything more than an experiment, and yes I know PSNOW is around but even with a decent connection it has issues that you would not see on an actual console. I detailed a bit of me following internet based cloud gaming for the past 15 years. I can tell you we are at the point where it becomes mainstream. Anyone who has actually been following this knows that we were ""a decade or two away from Cloud gaming"" 15 years ago.... We are 5, 10 years tops from mainstream cloud gaming and that includes on mobile networks. Like I said. I've been following digital distribution gaming and subscription services for the past 15 years. I use ""cloud gaming"" NOW and on my smartphone/tablet right now. No caveats. People have been using cloud gaming on mainstream consoles for the past 5 years already. The Wii U was essentially build around the premise of using remote hardware to play a game on a less powerful device. These are all the same concepts on display here. Yes the specific implementations may look different but the principles remain the same. Gamers are already and have already been playing games on hardware other than their physical consoles for years already. The expectation that this concept is 20 years in the future is misguided and ill-informed even about current trends in gaming happening today.",,michaelmikado,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,
