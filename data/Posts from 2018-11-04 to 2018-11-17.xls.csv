I just beat RDR2 and exploring New Austin in the game made me think about the possibility of a remake of RDR1 using RDR2’s engine and gameplay mechanics. I know RDR1 has shitty code and can’t be remastered, that’s why I’m saying remake and not remaster. Bear with me here. The entirety of New Austin and West Elizabeth have already been remade, which is a majority of the RDR1 map. All that’s left is the Mexico portion. It would make sense for Rockstar to want to further capitalize on RDR2’s hype. The series has now gained a bit more notoriety among mainstream audiences. I wouldn’t be surprised if a good chunk of RDR2 players are new to the series. I could see a lot of new players looking into RDR1 to continue the story, but maybe being turned off by the older graphics and less immersive gameplay mechanics. Or not being able to play it at all since it’s not backwards compatible on PS4 (unless you count PSNow). A lot of people who played RDR1 would also probably buy a remade version just to experience it again with modern graphics and mechanics. I certainly would. Remasters/remakes are already a pretty successful trend with this console generation anyway, and I can’t imagine Red Dead failing in that aspect in terms of sales. This would also finally bring RDR1 to PC. And while RDR2 isn’t on PC, we all know it’s going to happen eventually like with GTA V to get people to buy the game twice. Rockstar likes money. I could also see Rockstar wanting to hold off on releasing RDR2 on PC until RDR1 is on there as well, to allow PC players to get the entire experience. Maybe we could see a dual release? If they remade RDR1, they would need to remake Mexico as well, and I could totally see them adding Mexico to Red Dead Online as a big expansion. Not to mention other stuff from RDR1 as well. A remake would be an easy excuse to release more content into Online (gotta make that Shark Card money). A remake could also include Easter eggs, maybe even minor story changes (not sure how I’d feel about that though), to allow for better continuity between RDR1 and 2. Like how Makarov was placed into MW Remastered. Lastly, we’ll be seeing RDR1’s 10 year anniversary in May 2020, which would be a long enough time to give RDR2 some breathing room, but still short enough to still ride the hype. That’s all I have to say, thanks for reading.",,Something627,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Also phantom brave and the other not-disgaea games are good but the whole disgaea series (including the spin offs) just get better with each entry, the quality is almost a straight linear improvement. I guess if you never really went into post game that wouldn't be true, you could totally enjoy the games as straight forward srpg faire with a little story and call it quits, but the game features a ton of systems that are only fully explored by going hard in the post game. Those systems, for me, are where all the fun is. The stories might be better or worse but because this game is 99% mechanics and systems and 1% story+anime it still works out that any of the older entries feel REAL dated compared to the new stuff. If you're digging some disgaea and you already beat/got bored with D5 you can find D4 on PSnow I think, at least last time I checked.

I've yet to have a good connection over wifi for the purpose of anything. It's significantly worse than the PS3 which is worse than most PCs/Laptops/Phones. It's like barely worth having there, from my experience. Downloading tends to be OK, because it's not so much the speed as the consistency of the connection. It will download *slower* than on wired, but it's doable. However, once you go into online play, streaming netflix, or PSNow, you're going to hit lots of disconnects/blurry screens/latency etc. Anyway, on wired, PSNow has been great. *Note: I have a 75 Mbps DL 7 Mbps UL, but have also tested in 3 different cities (Toronto, Calgary and Victoria Canada) with 3 different service providers.*",,aberthin,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

I have both services and I really haven’t even noticed any major Sony games leave. So it seems it’s one here and there. The other difference is Sony have something like 600 games compared to Game Pass 100. While Sony is more expensive you get a ton more and games don’t leave as often or in as high a volume. I wish Microsoft would let their library build a bit more instead of putting 5 new games on and pulling 7 games every other month or so.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Quote: : Rather be blue with taxes than in a land of Donald Dump supporters tho Aren't you special",,philzilla,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Chicago introduces 9% ""Cloud Tax"" for PlayStation Plus/Now Users",,,

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

 Inside that tiny box is the same open-source emulator you can download right now on your PC (plus 20 game files).

Sony’s upcoming PlayStation Classic uses 
the open-source emulator PCSX ReARMed
 to recreate 
its selection of 20 classic games
. Kotaku’s 
recent hands-on report
 with the plug-and-play HDMI system noticed an on-screen menu listing a legal license for the emulator. 

ReARMed is a popular, modernized branch of the original PCSX emulator, which was actively developed from 2000 to 2003 for Linux, Mac, and Windows. A new branch called PCSX Reloaded picked up that development later in the decade, adding new features and fixing bugs and eventually leading to the ReARMed fork. The emulator supports network play and a “save rewind” feature that lets you easily reverse recent gameplay, two features which seem to be missing from the PlayStation Classic.

For its recently released NES and SNES Classic micro-consoles, Nintendo used specially crafted emulators 
developed by its European Research and Development
 division. That emulator 
offered more vibrant colors and less blurriness
 than Nintendo’s previous Virtual Console emulators for the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS. 

Sony offered a wide selection of downloadable original PlayStation games for emulation on the PS3 and PlayStation Vita through its Classics line. While some PS2 games are similarly available on the PS4 (and many others can be supported through hacking), the only way to play original PlayStation games on the system through the paid PlayStation Now streaming service.

Hackers have previously found a fully functional PSP emulator hidden inside recent HD re-releases of Parappa the Rapper and Loco Roco 2 on the PS4.

Some commentators have already attacked Sony for “laziness” by piggybacking off the work of the open source community rather than coding a new “official” emulator for this new release. But Video Game History Foundation Founder Frank Cifaldi instead sees the move as “an acknowledgement that an ‘amateur’ emulator can be just as valid as an 'official’ one (and they’re usually better!)… I’ve seen people complaining that they’re buying something that’s free, but what the heck alternative is there? Should we expect Sony to spend the time and money-making something that is probably not going to end up being as good as PCSX? Why?”",,27mrblaze,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Sony using open-source emulator for PlayStation Classic plug-and-play,Post,,

The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court.

I mean, how far in the future are we talking about? 5 years? 10 years? more? It's really very hard to predict. I could say that since VR seems to be picking up, then you should invest in a PC as VR headsets will become better and better and will provide more immersive games for which you'll be needing higher-end PCs. But then what if they start making standalone VRs such as Oculus Quest that don't need a PC in order to run. What if VR doesn't pick up at all? What if you get motion-sickness and can't even play in VR? PC would be the obvious answer. As mentioned by others, it is modular, can be easily upgraded and maintained and chances are sooner or later someone somewhere will be able to create working emulators for all the other consoles out there (PS4, Switch, etc) and if not then you can also hope that Game Streaming services such as Playstation Now will become better, allowing you to play previously exclusive titles on your PC. It might be important to highlight that a PC is also more expensive than most consoles but the argument can be made that since you're able to upgrade components such as the gpu, in the long run it won't be that expensive when compared to consoles which you have to buy a new one every generation in order to enjoy the newer titles. But perhaps you're asking the wrong question. Perhaps a better question to ask would be ""what kind of games do you enjoy playing?"" and ""where do you enjoy playing them and with whom?"". The answer to those questions might more easily point you in the right direction.",,r3aps0w,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The Switch started it off and reached 22 million in less than two years & that number is bound to increase with Smash & all the titles coming out next year. Despite these great games, Nintendo is running into a predictable problem. Microsoft has acquired several new studios for first-party development, which will greatly benefit them because some of the studios they acquired are responsible for some of gaming’s biggest hits. This E3 they already said they are working on the next Xbox console. Then you have the PlayStation 5, stupid name but it’s coming. Power is the issue here. While Nintendo releases great games, they aren’t going to stay relevant if they don’t release an upgraded Switch that can support more games. The Switch is a brilliant idea & it should not be wasted on ports from previous consoles. I don’t regret buying my Switch, had it since launch, but unless they release some sort of hardware upgrade then it won’t be popular in the coming year. ====================::==================== the_wire30 said: ↑ phantomnx said: ↑ What kind of bet? I’m interested Click to expand... But what are the reasons they wouldn't call it PS5? Click to expand... Because the next system will be their first successive system that isn’t a complete departure from previous architecture hardware. And I don’t see them ever going back down that road again. Meaning, the next system will be the exact same basic architecture as the ps4 pro...just more powerful. Meaning...the next new PlayStation will be fully backwards compatable to the ps4 (and play games from all previous PlayStations) Therefore, there is no reasonable need to differentiate their systems with numbers any more. PlayStation going forward needs to inform consumers that PlayStation systems from now on will be all encompassing, a pervasive ecosystem, not a complete cutoff from previous gens like before. They need to position the PlayStation system as a new brand of gaming system going forward. The future is that every new PlayStation system you buy, it plays all past PlayStation games as well. Either through disc access, or PsNow downloads/streaming. I have a hunch they want to try and differentiate the “ps5” from the ps4 pro. Naming it something else besides a iteration number will get people’s attention about what PlayStation systems will be now. There is no reason to NOT drop the numeral iteration on their home console at this point. They don’t need the 5 for some kind of brand recognition or market awareness.

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== Well now, isn’t that just spiffy!

179769609739,11/4/2018,http://bleacherreview.tumblr.com/post/179769609739,"By Anthony Watt /             Nov 4, 2018 3:32 PM




 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network. -- http://www.bleacherreview.com/2018/11/microsoft-reports-record-q1-results-as.html",,bleacherreview,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

You can ignore in this case that MS made pay to play online a industry standard. You're wrong but you can pretend you're not. Your argument boils down to ""you don't like my brand"" wahhhhh. You don't know me or what I like. Certainly not in any capacity to make this assumption out of your ass. I've owned Xbox consoles I've had a live account for many years. My point still stands and it's more truth than opinion. MS made it an industry standard. Sony followed suit as is Nintendo. I'm not ""selectively"" blaming shit. I'm stating a fact. If that hurts your feelings maybe you're too invested. Not my problem. So MS implemented XBL paid plans when they were getting outsold something like 6 to 1 by Sony yet you still blame them. Sony could have easily said ""Nope, we are not going to charge"" but they didn't did they? You (and the rest that bitch and moan about it) could have refused to buy it and they would have had to change but you didn't. It's awesome that you think a bit player (MS at the time in the console space) sets the industry standard. How cute! Are you this enraged over PlayStation Now or is Sony to benevolent to wish us gamers any ill will? I never said you didn't own an Xbox but apparently you are too hot and bothered by people disagreeing with your bullshit that you just assumed that. My point still stands--if you have evidence of MS's plans then share them with the rest of us. If not you are talking out of your ass and claiming it to be THE TRUTH.

But even this is a better story than Nintendo -- while it's not true of all PS3s, I bet I can find one on eBay that still includes the PS2 compatibility. And they all would've included HDMI outs, so they'd work with my TV. So I only need to go back *one* generation -- that and a PS4 Pro and I could play not just the greatest hits, but *most* Playstation games. (I absolutely should have done this instead of using PSNow for PS3 compatibility -- streaming sucks.) But also, there are remasters! Sony has done a *lot* more of these than Nintendo has -- unless I missed one, there's basically two of these (Wind Waker and Twilight Princess). There's a lot less demand, because they keep making similar enough games -- there's nothing like Shadow of the Colossus *anywhere,* but most Nintendo consoles will have at least a Mario and a Zelda, and having played Pikmin 3, I don't feel like I was missing out by not having played Pikmin 1 and 2. But if you want the original games, I'd much rather have an actual remaster than an N64 game running in an emulator on my Wii U! --- Second: This is only really a problem on consoles. On PCs, most old games end up on Steam or GOG, or even for free on archive.org... or if you just happen to have them lying around, there's a good chance they'll still work! Not always painlessly, but DOS games pretty much Just Work in DOSBox, and with a little massaging, Windows games will often work *natively* on a modern PC. I mean, okay, Deus Ex really wants to be a square aspect ratio, but it'll run at modern resolutions and refresh rates, and there's even mods that will [swap out the entire renderer for a DirectX 10 one](http://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/)... usually without requiring emulation, cracks, or ROMs. I think that's what people mean by the Valve approach.",,SanityInAnarchy,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network. -- http://www.bleacherreview.com/2018/11/microsoft-reports-record-q1-results-as.html",,bleacherreview,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

Sounds like damage control to me Funny you try to turn this into another ""lol Sony is better"" thing. PSNow is several years old, double the price per month of Xbox Game Pass and had to claw its way to where it is now. Game Pass is still in the very early stages of its life. It's doing great, all things considered. Texas Pride said: If you're not getting paid to say shit like this you're failing. It's one thing to like the service and it's another to basically be happy that games ownership is going the way of the Dodo. I can't believe people would be so obtuse as to embrace a future where we're all tied down to multiple subscription services instead of traditional ownership. Those of you embracing this are giving it up far too cheap imo. You know you don't own any of the games you buy, right? You own a license that can be rescinded for a variety of reasons, at any time. I mean, I already watch all my visual media (movies, series, etc) in subscription format, so why is this so much different? Instead of paying 100s of Euros a month for physical versions of movies and series, I pay roughly 20 Euro between Netflix and Amazon and get to watch literally thousands. I'd be happy to pay even 60 Euro a month for a gaming subscription instead of 60 euro per game. 10 Euro for Game Pass is ridiculously good value. It's fine if you're not a fan of subscription models, but why get so upset that other people don't feel the same as you?

Fact of the matter is, Microsoft, Google and potentially Amazon is changing the entire landscape of gaming. They aren't flipping the narrative or moving the goal posts like Sony. They are strapping a nuke to the field and hitting the giant red ""RESET"" button. There is a paradigm shift coming in gaming. Microsoft saw it early on and are touting numbers in terms of users for a reason. Those who think it's because their sales are lower than Sony's...that's a very small part of it. They are preparing themselves for the likes of Amazon and Google, who are much bigger threats than Sony, not in terms of sales or anything trivial like that. Google is trying to get to the aforementioned red ""RESET"" button first. All 3 of these companies are working on cloud services for their games. Sony is going to either have to align with one of them or get left in the dust. The best they have is Gaikai right now for PSNow. They are going to be 3 years late to the party for backwards compatibility. Them sticking to their guns while everybody else is evolving is not going to be a good thing for them. I'm sure they'll make their money, but when the Playstation is the only real thing they got going for them...it just doesn't seem smart to not keep up. You guys can rest on your laurels if you want, but if you're a real fan of Sony, you need to be more forward thinking and stop reveling in stats that won't matter in a couple of years. The fact that Sony purchased Gakai and OnLive back when they did, shows pretty forward thinking to what was coming.",,DeepEnigma,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,,,,,,,,

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Time for Watch Dogs' Aiden Pearce (from Chicago) and Marcus to get in there and fix the corruption.",,Zivouhr,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Chicago introduces 9% ""Cloud Tax"" for PlayStation Plus/Now Users",,,

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network. -- http://www.bleacherreview.com/2018/11/microsoft-reports-record-q1-results-as.html",,bleacherreview,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

The issue is that people didn't really use that app so they dropped support. I assume people didn't use it very often because the people interested in the service were existing PC/PS4 owners using the service at home. Unfortunately mobile networks aren't built for low latency. When you are on a mobile network you have bad latency. You are also connecting and reconnecting to different towers when on the go. you would have possible seconds of latency or more which means massive input lag. Sony probably looked at customer use and dropped support for the mobile app. Saw that they were either getting complaints of it not working properly on mobile or those that didn't complain simply didn't use the mobile app all that much because they were at home (using their PC or PS4). This isn't a 'Sony doesn't have anything to contend or them shutting down cloud computing' like you suggested. This is them already seeing what the customers use. If they see the need for it it's as easy as supporting the client app again. It's just a simple client app and nothing to do with cloud computing capability. Actually wasn't aware PSNOW had a mobile app. Very interesting. From what you're saying it doesn't sound like they invested much into it though. So I guess the magnitude in which Google and Microsoft are doing this has not been tried before. It's been dabbled in by Sony. Nothing serious though. So I guess the question at this point is would Sony jump back in. I mean all 3 companies have an insane amount of brand recognition to people in the mobile market, though I would argue Google has the advantage due to android and honestly...Microsoft might be in 3rd place. Sure they got tablet in the Surface Pro and the often Windows phones. Now that I think about it though...Is Google trying to work on all devices with Google Stream? Or is it more just streaming games on Chrome? Which I suppose could also work on Android devices.

So of course Sony makes more when they sold way more consoles and charge twice as much. This, however, is only good for Sony. The consumer base doesn’t get anything out of getting charged so much. I believe this was proven false, but that shows that EA access has the most subs. followed by psnow which is on ps4 tvs, and pcs. then gamepass which is just xbox has about a 60 percent as many as psnow.

180028245724,11/12/2018,http://toptechnewsandbuzz.tumblr.com/post/180028245724,"Game streaming offers an enticing alternative to buying either physical or digital games. Aside from the cost of maintaining a subscription to a streaming service being significantly lower than purchasing new games outright, streaming services also allow you to jump into the action without waiting for huge installations and updates.

In the past, streaming services like OnLive failed to catch on — game streaming isn’t for everyone; however, for players with a good, consistent internet connection and a penchant for jumping from game to game without plans to return to any one title, it’s the perfect option.

Here are some of the best game-streaming services you can try right now, with some game recommendations to give you a sense of the games you’ll get to play on each one.

PlayStation Now



Sony has some of the best first-party video games around, but you previously needed to own one of the company’s consoles in order to play them. With PlayStation Now, you can play a wide variety of exclusive PlayStation games from your PC or your PlayStation 4.

On PC, all you need in a DualShock 4 controller with either a wireless adapter or USB mini cable as well as a PlayStation Network account and at least 5 Mbps of internet download speed. PlayStation 4 users need the same internet speed on their game console, and with either a 7-day free trial or a paid subscription, you’re ready to play the best PlayStation exclusives.

For PS4 players, a PlayStation Now subscription includes full access to multiplayer support, even if you have not subscribed to PlayStation Plus. Your save files will be compatible with on both PC and PS4.

PlayStation Now currently features some older PlayStation exclusives, including Killzone: Shadow Fall, The Last of Us, Until Dawn, and God of War III: Remastered. It also supports a number of third-party games, such as Dishonored, Batman: Arkham Origins, BioShock Infinite, and Saints Row IV. New games are added every month, and the full catalog now includes more than 600 titles. PlayStation Now costs $20 for a one-month subscription, or $45 for a three-month subscription.

GeForce Now



Own a Mac or a low-end PC, but want to play the latest AAA games? With GeForce Now, you can play the latest and greatest from major publishers without having to worry about your computer catching fire or, worse, running Bootcamp.

GeForce Now is not a content service like many of the other services on our list. You have to purchase the games you want to play through a digital store, such as Steam, Uplay, or Blizzard’s Battle.net. Once you’ve installed the app on your machine, GeForce’s cloud-based processors will allow you to run the game on any device, independent of their specs.

The service requires a higher internet download speed than GameFly Streaming – 25 Mbps minimum and 50 Mbps recommended – and you must have MacOS 10.10 or higher or Windows 7 64-bit or later in order to run it. Either an Ethernet connection or a Wi-Fi connection using a 5 GHz router is required, and you can use either a mouse-and-keyboard setup or one of several gamepads. Sessions are currently capped at four hours per player before you have to start a new session in order to keep the servers available for other players.

GeForce now is compatible with a huge assortment of games, though you do have to buy them in order to use them with the service. The list includes Assassin’s Creed Origins, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, Injustice 2, Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, and Middle-earth: Shadow of War, to name a few. GeForce Now is currently in beta testing and is free for users during the trial period. You can sign up for the waitlist on the official website.

Jump



The other game streaming services on our list focus primarily on big-budget AAA games from major publishers. That’s great and all, but there are times when you’re more interested in playing an independent game from a small studio, instead, and Jump is the perfect service to do it.

Jump provides a latency-free game streaming service the company says is on par with what you expect from a game fully installed on your device. Whether you’re gaming on a Windows PC, Linux PC, or Mac, you can play the service’s library of games. It also supports both the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive headsets. Your save data is stored in the cloud, so you can always pick up right where you left off, even if you switch devices. Another neat feature: There are no microtransactions in any of Jump’s games.

The one caveat with Jump is that the technology used – dubbed “HyperJump” – uses your local system hardware in order to run games. This means your system will have to be capable of playing the game, though the majority of the games offered through Jump aren’t particularly taxing.

The roster of games you can play with Jump – all of which are included in the $5 monthly subscription cost – includes well-known indie games such as Cook, Serve, Delicious!, Gunhouse, Nidhogg, and The End is Nigh. New games are added every month, and 70 percent of the proceeds go back to the developers whose games are included in the Jump library. You can try a two-week free trial, and subscriptions can be canceled at any time.

GameFly Streaming



Want to play games, but don’t have a console or a gaming PC? Gamefly Streaming, the digital wing of the “Netflix for Games” service, allows you to play a selection of older AAA games on a variety of streaming devices, including the Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, the EMTEC GEM Box, and both Samsung and LG Smart television sets. GameFly Streaming works with nearly any game controller you’ll find in stores. From the PlayStation 4’s DualShock 4 to the Xbox One gamepad, you can pick whichever one suits you the most.

GameFly Streaming also supports local multiplayer games, so a friend can get in on the action, provided they also have a controller. The service saves your data in the cloud for up to 90 days after you cancel your subscription, so you can restart your membership and pick up right where you left off in your favorite title.

Two different subscription packs – “gamer” and “family” — are available through GameFly Streaming, each for under $10 per month. The service requires a 5 Mbps internet speed and suggests 10 Mbps for the best experience, and it supports both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity. If you already own a device capable of running the GameFly streaming app, you can try it for free right now.

Current games available through GameFly streaming include BioShock and BioShock 2, Clustertruck, Bridge Constructor, and Adventure Time: Finn & Jake Investigations.

Honorable mention: Xbox Game Pass



The other services on our list rely on streaming technology to deliver you your games, but Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass works a little differently. For $10 per month, a subscription to Xbox Game Pass gives you access to more than 100 games, and you download them onto your Xbox One’s storage device just like you would with any other digital game.

This means you don’t have to worry about your internet speed affecting the quality of your game experience, and even if you lose your connection, you’ll still be able to play games.

And the games – the games. Xbox Game Pass has perhaps the best library of free games of any service on our list. From Rise of the Tomb Raider to Gears of War 4, nearly every notable Xbox One game you can think of is included through the program, and a selection of Xbox 360 games are also available through backward compatibility. It isn’t limited to Microsoft-published games, either, with a variety of third-party games also available. The kicker, however, is Microsoft’s policy for future Xbox exclusives. All first-party Xbox games going forward will be included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription at no extra charge on launch day. Sea of Thieves is already available, and big-name games like Crackdown 3 and State of Decay 2 are coming later in 2018.",,toptechnewsandbuzz,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,The Best Game Streaming Services,Post,,

Given that the player’s only regular companion in Bloodborne is also a doll, the connection is pretty clear. Where it gets exciting is the doll’s description, which reads: “A doll of the stone girl Fiona, who appears in the unfinished tale. When a person has a bad dream, Fiona appears and helps them flee.” You can take a look for yourself over at Amazing Komaru’s YouTube channel, which comes to us via FextraLife . But those words ‘the unfinished tale’ stand out as a possible hint that FromSoftware has more to tell us about Bloodborne’s world, especially since the original ends quite satisfactorily. But then, you could say the same about Dark Souls, and that eventually become a trilogy. FromSoftware’s next project is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, releasing on March 22 next year. Could Bloodborne 2 follow? Bloodborne easter egg in Déraciné!! - Connection confirmed! But yeah, we know what you’re thinking, and at this point we have to acknowledge that the original Bloodborne was published with Sony’s help and exclusive to PlayStation 4. It’s very possible that would continue to be the case for a sequel, depending on the terms of the original deal, but there’s hope. All the Dark Souls games have been on PC, Sekiro will be, and if all else fails, Bloodborne was added to Sony’s PC-compatible streaming service, PlayStation Now, in September. So one way or another, there’s a decent chance PC gamers would be able to try a Bloodborne sequel, even if it’s not at launch.

THE STREAMING PART of PSNow is crap. I'm sure Sony is preparing. I have absolutely no doubt about that. However, in order to compete with Project xCloud, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud they are way far behind and likely won't have anything self-developed in terms of infrastructure by time the other guys are already on the field. The only way I can see them doing this is by purchasing existing services like they did with Gaikai or partnering with someone like IBM, who already has a comparable cloud infrastructure setup. I do not expect them to have their own infrastructure, but I do expect them to partner if this ever comes a big enough market in gaming. All of the others you mentioned, will be dealing with the very same quantum physics, and there will be no magic solvent to input lag/jitter/latency on the private networks.

Nintendo Switch wouldn't be a bad addition (for its first party exclusives and portability), but I'm not a fan of their games' pricing and how long they usually go before they go on a sale. The reason for the former (PS4 vs. Xbox One) is, if you have a good gaming PC, then you have access to the large majority of Xbox One's bigger exclusive games anyway. If you pick up the Xbox Game Pass on Windows 10, then due to some titles' [Play Anywhere] feature, you get to play quite a few titles for a low monthly fee, this includes Sea of Thieves, Gears of War 4, Super Lucky's Tale and co. In addition to that, Microsoft is planning to officially add Xbox Game Pass to Windows 10, which would ultimately mean PC support wouldn't be dependent on the Play Anywhere feature, https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/26/18027142/xbox-game-pass-pc-windows-10-microsoft The above, might very well be because Microsoft is making their xCloud streaming service, allowing even more Xbox One exclusives to work on a larger variety of systems, including PC as a stream from cloud Xbox to non-native systems. How well it works is yet to be seen, but hopefully it works better than Sony's PlayStation Now. Sony this generation has done heck of a job with their first party titles, enough so that if you were to say ""AAA games nowadays are not for the consumer, but for the stockholder, you should just stick to AA and indie games now"", Sony's first party games would show none of the industry crap in their games. While I liked Uncharted 4 personally (while its harder difficulties are absolute crap sometimes), after having just played Uncharted 3: Remastered at 60 FPS, the 30 FPS drop was awful. It's one I might've overlooked a bit better had the transition not happened so quickly for me. It's one of those times when while a game can be very pretty and fun to play, the fact bigger publishers still don't deem performance as a contributing factor to enjoyment is ridiculous, in my opinion. Also, it just goes to show how little control you ultimately have in how you play console games. Similarly though, like how history repeats itself (thinking of Microsoft's arrogance the start of this generation; after Xbox 360's success the previous generation), Sony has also acted the most arrogant out of the three this generation while Microsoft has been a bit more pro-gamer with their more apologetic stance. It took them forever to recognize that crossplay is a thing in 2018, and now they're censoring certain Japanese titles which arrive on both PC and Nintendo Switch uncensored. While some people might not care for that per se, it's still a matter of principle. The fact I have far more control in how I play my games: graphics and performancewise, controller wise, not having a company dictate if I can or can't play something, free online, backwards compatibility to my childhood era of games, etc is why I always find myself playing games more on my PC. Anyway, Disgaea 5 is one game that I own on both PS4 and Steam, albeit both times my brother has played the game way more than I have. Same goes for Yakuza 0, that too I own on both my PS4 and Steam. I hope SEGA manages to push Atlus to release their Persona titles to PC too. At the very least, Atlus finally recognized PC as a gaming platform in their most recent survey. That's... at least a step in the right direction, ha. While the probability is high that PS5 will have backwards compatibility with PS4 due to how similar its specs have come to that of a PC, I have less and less reasons to believe I'll pick up a PS5 seeing how many titles find their way to PC now. The fact the hardware is more similar to PC, is also more reason to believe in third party port jobs happening. As far as Red Dead Redemption 2 goes, I'll wait for the PC version myself. I have faith in that coming due to the Companion app already having parameters suggesting Oculus and PC related stuff, the LinkedIn -profile of that one Rockstar employee's, and how the Grand Theft Auto V played out in the past.",,Teutep,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Sunset Overdrive is coming to steam,,,

And I don’t see them ever going back down that road again. Meaning, the next system will be the exact same basic architecture as the ps4 pro...just more powerful. Meaning...the next new PlayStation will be fully backwards compatable to the ps4 (and play games from all previous PlayStations) Therefore, there is no reasonable need to differentiate their systems with numbers any more. PlayStation going forward needs to inform consumers that PlayStation systems from now on will be all encompassing, a pervasive ecosystem, not a complete cutoff from previous gens like before. They need to position the PlayStation system as a new brand of gaming system going forward. The future is that every new PlayStation system you buy, it plays all past PlayStation games as well. Either through disc access, or PsNow downloads/streaming. I have a hunch they want to try and differentiate the “ps5” from the ps4 pro. Naming it something else besides a iteration number will get people’s attention about what PlayStation systems will be now. There is no reason to NOT drop the numeral iteration on their home console at this point. They don’t need the 5 for some kind of brand recognition or market awareness.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

I’ve heard that great games usually don’t start to show up in a gen till around its third year once devs have had time to fully play with the hardware and software discovering what its limits are and put their creative thinking to it. Not doubting From at all though and it’s probably diff for them as they don’t seem to be in the market of pushing what hardware can be capable of but instead pushing creative core gaming design so they’re probably a dev that could deliver exactly what they want out the gate. Infamous Second Son was good and probably still the best looking game I’ve personally seen on PS4 but it hasn’t gone down by the public as a God of War, Horizon, Bloodborne level game. On the side note; I’m one that’s content with Xbox One X power and at this time I really don’t know where a new generation goes from it. There’s a little room on the PS4 Pro side for hardware growth but I wonder if it’s worth a entire new gen. But I’m thinking in terms of what console gens have always focused on which is graphic bumps. 4K HDR @60fps as a standard seems as far as consoles would go to right now which seems like more of a hardware update like Pro and X rather than a whole new gen. Seems we’re where we are for a while till 8K 120hz TV’s become the new norm. I mean even now not as many people as you’d think even have upgraded to 4K tv’s yet. Plus, I personally don’t want anymore new generation resets. That way I can buy a new console whenever I feel like it and not because I have to in order to play a new game that’s new gen only. Plus I fear losing all games I already paid for and factoring in digital games it seems almost criminal (metaphorically) to replace a console for next gen where it won’t support backwards compatibility and I’ve bought all my games digitally. Not to bash Sony but then there’s my personal thoughts of their track record where I believe there’d be a high probability if a PS5 were to support backwards compatibility they’d put it behind a paywall even if you already own the game - like PlayStation Now. When X was announced I thought a future of hardware upgrades is what each would do, but after the reception of the original Xbox One and the conversations I’ve seen over new gens vs. upgrades I’ve realized how hard it is on either of the two non-Nintendo companies to implement change where gaming is concerned. I at least don’t want to see a ps5 or Xbox scarlet until there’s a new technical advancement in TV’s that’s going to be on par for the new norm to replace what’s affordably norm now. So, 2025 at the earliest, lol.",,Samdgadii,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

It's fun too because Atreus I don't think truly understands how powerful his Dad is, hes simply his Dad to him. Ultimately you may notice his wrists and a scar on his belly which he was stabbed by a sword made by Zeus, twice. Once by Zeus and once by himself at the end of the game. His wrists are from his old weapons he used which symbolized his bondage to Ares the greek god of war originally. I think if you know the above thats about all necessary for the new one.

Everything in the world today runs on a subscription based service when it comes digital content.. you have Netflix, Amazon and now even YouTube is getting in on the action (even though they make their money from ads, which you still get in their subscription service btw. Just less of them) TV and Music I am ok with because I can watch and listen to them wherever I go but console gaming you cant, we're not there yet. 2. MMO's are a good subscription based service because you have everything all in one, plus with regular content updates and what not else but you dont get that with console games that is what dlc is for. If they were to start a subscription based service I wouldn't buy into it. The one thing I hate about the Xbox Game Pass and Playstation Now and Origin Access is that. The games libraries aren't really that vast (yes I know they are adding more each month) but you are also having to pay for games that you dont want or even think you will play. Each subscription service is going to cost at least a 10er per month. If every publisher in the world was to employ this model and someone was to subscribe to them all, that round about 120 a month then you will have to purchase MxT's and DLC on top of that for the games you want to play. To me it seems more about the money and not about the games because let's face it, majority of games that have come out over the last 5 years have mostly been god awful messes at launch and then tend to get fixed during the games life cycle which again isnt fair because that again is more like early access at full game prices. The world of gaming and development has become nothing but a cash cow for most publishers now (even though it is the largest and most lucrative digital market on the planet just now anyways)",,RoboGlitch,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

With everyone able to play together, on whatever computing device they want, be it mobile, tv, laptop, or glorious desktop, there would be no room for filthy console exclusives and fake brand loyalties... However, looking at the near future of streaming, I do not see this gamer-first utopia. I see division, I see more exclusives, I see a global war that targets PCMR younglings and corrupts their hearts. The console wars are going digital, and we may be powerless to stop them. ​ **Background:** The future is streaming. Period. * Google's [Project Stream](https://projectstream.google.com/aco/invite) in Beta * [Playstation Now](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-now/) in full force * [Project xCloud](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/08/project-xcloud-gaming-with-you-at-the-center/) is a hot mess, but it is Coming * Even [Switch](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-09-18-nintendo-switch-owners-in-japan-are-getting-a-cloud-version-of-assassins-creed-odyssey) is getting in the game Why now, when this has been tried for over a decade? * We now have enough server space world-wide that is cheap enough * We now have high speed internet in most parts of the world * We now have better software to handle stream latency ""Great, more ways to play, what's the big deal?"" What *should* happen is that more and more games should support cross ""platform"" play and, with the exception of competitive shooters, more and more games can move to online only, allowing easier access to games for casual gamers and enthusiasts. What *will likely* happen, is that the console wars will encompass more players and divide them more between **more exclusives**. You will have to purchase a monthly subscription to more and more companies, to play your games. What the glorious promise of Netflix once was, there now lies only the ruins of Hulu, HBOGo, and Disney+... How soon will all of this happen? That is really the only thing up for debate. It really depends on whether Sony and Microsoft will launch one final console, before moving entirely online. But the switch to streaming only should happen in the next 2-5 years. So, I ask you, with this inevitable move to streaming, how does PCMR survive? And, more importantly, how do we help convince publishers and 'stream owners' that **games should be a tool to bring people together, and not to divide them**?",,I_am_Searching,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== Guess Spending less or stop overpromising civil servants fat retirements is not an option?",,Squid,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,GOV/MIL Tax games: Chicago PlayStation users furious at new city fee,,,

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

Again, the question is what do they do now? They don't have a cloud. Answer the question. What do they do now? Nobody can seem to answer this...I'm apparently the fanboy just because I'm talking common sense with the evidence we have right now. While you refer to a failed service as being an indication that they are automatically ready for the next generation when streaming is going to be paramount even though they don't have the infrastructure to compete. If I'm wrong...show me the evidence. Streaming will be paramount? If so, my money is on Google. MS's plan's, from what I understand, involves people buying special hardware for their streaming service. This will reduce latency a bit and improve picture quality. OTOH, Google's competing service doesn't, as long as it runs chrome it'll be able to stream. So, my money is on Google and it has nothing to do with their owning servers worldwide. Vast majority will not buy new hardware for slight increase in quality. As far as needing to own a global server network for a streaming service, that is bollocks. Netflix doesn't have one. Youtube didn't for the longest time. psnow doesn't. Nvidia game service doesn't. And Nintendo streamed RE7 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey to their Japanese customers despite not owning Japan-wide farms. So, if you are arguing that a company needs their own server infrastructure in order to make games playable, well that is false. Or is it that the global infrastructure is needed in order to make it cheap enough? Possible I guess.

So if your friends game on XBox (because they don't have PCs), then that's what you game on. (unless it's crossplay) I was actually asking a question and forgot the question mark! Thanks for answering my question I didn't realize you can't crossplay between Xbox and PC. IMHO, it's rather ridiculous MS spends a lot of time trying to take the high side on crossplay to dump on Sony when they don't even allow it between their own platforms. > If you have a PC, you can play some of the games on PC with Play Anywhere (if you could do this with every game, it would be amazing) I can play them on my PC. > Xbox One X is currently the best experience for 4k console gaming of cross platform games But I have a PC. > If you prefer the XBox Elite Controller to the PS4 Controller, that's an option I can use it on my PC. > Spiderman is almost like Sunset Overdrive 2 :) Yeah. It's a bummer that there never was a true Sunset Overdrive 2. > If you like Playstation Now Then you're weird. IMHO. That's not a good offering. I was indicating that a PS4 is a good complement to a PC because it gets you access to the exclusives you won't get on a PC. XBox is less good because most of the exclusives (Sunset Overdrive and Halo being the exceptions and SO is mentioned here as maybe coming to PC) are already on the PC. But yeah, there will be an argument for an Xbox, it'll usually revolve around ""But I prefer consoles, and I want the one with the best graphical quality."" A PC just can't cover all the bases if you prefer consoles.",,happyscrappy,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

As for bluetooth, you can find a few accessories to make your PC work with bluetooth. However, you can also just plug the cable into any USB port and work it out that way. As long as you're using some kind of PS4 controller or supported PS4 controller alternatives, then you should be fine. I personally wouldn't try using the bluetooth with it though and stick to the cable. Less latency and helps you out more.

Starting November 14, residents should expect an increase on their PlayStation Store receipts, which include “PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Now, PlayStation Vue, PlayStation Music, PlayStation Video On Demand, and PlayStation Video Live Events.” The tax isn't popular in the city of Chicago, but Emanuel says the taxes are necessary to shore up the city's pensions. Several companies like Apple and Netflix are taking action against the city for the taxes, but until any changes are made, PlayStation gamers are now subject to the same tax as other amusement activities. ====================::==================== velusip said: ↑ *knock knock* Fun police!

It does not matter who you vote for it is the same shit every time, people talk shit about an amusement tax it is nothing, if you don't have a lawyer/ real estate to value your house for taxes and bring those taxes down you will get fucked so hard that 9% will look like the promised land.

Now, we see the actual revenue and we can again see why Micosoft is moving Game Pass to PC (following all of their first party titles). It is because install base is king. And if you want to compete with that insane install base, you can't do it even if you technically offer the ""better"" service (Day one first party games. You're never getting Spider-Man day one on PSNow). The question now becomes, can Microsoft's specialty streaming service compete with the ""failure"" that is PSNow?

A ruling back in 2015 by the city’s department of finance extended the Amusement Tax to cover streaming content as well as more traditional forms of entertainment. On Wednesday, Sony will begin complying with that ruling for PlayStation owners in Chicago. Polygon reports: The tax applies to things like rentals, not full sales of video games (where other sales taxes would still apply). Chicago, like many cities, has had an amusement tax for years, and last year moved to increase it (which the public detested) to help shore up a budget deficit. A ruling in 2015 by the city’s department of finance extended the tax to charges for streaming content — including movies, music and games — paid by customers in the city. It has since been called the “cloud tax,” “Netflix tax,” and even the “Hamilton tax” after the blockbuster musical. It’s important to note this is for rentals, not full sales, which would already be subject to local and state sales taxes that PlayStation began collecting back in 2016. PlayStation users with a billing address in the city got a notice this week saying the tax would be applied toward transactions on all of the PlayStation Store’s streaming and rental offerings — PlayStation Plus, Now, Vue, Music, Video on Demand and Video Live Events. The tax will only affect rental sales, as full game sales are already subject to local and state taxes thanks to a PlayStation Store update in 2016. The tax will affect all users with a billing address in the city of Chicago. The tax will be applied toward transactions on all of the PlayStation Store’s streaming and rental services including PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Now, Video on Demand, Video Live Events, Music, and even PlayStation Vue. The tax is not without its opponents as Apple sued the city back in August, calling the tax unconstitutional.

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== It’s expensive to pay the medical bills for all those shot-up ghetto-n*ggers.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court.

So wasn't factoring PC at all. I mean I'm a PC player since existence. And never owned a console and not planning to. So I think the comparison is not fair to factor in PC. Cause, after all, PlayStation Now is also available on PC. Back to that list I made: * Ori is available on Xbox & not on PS4. And a sequel is coming up. * Insomniac is a 2nd party developer. Will develop any game for any company. So we don't know their future projects. And FYI, Spiderman (the games) IP is owned by Marvel & not Sony. So Marvel might change their minds about future games & make them multiplat after the success Sony had with Spiderman! We don't know. * Halo 5 is sitting at 84% on Metacritic. Don't know what you're talking about. * Cuphead is not available on PS4. Only on Xbox Others might not be good examples, but, at least MS did release noteworthy games. Which was the point I wanted to make. There are other things to take into consideration when picking up a console. Exclusive titles might not be the most important factor for everybody. I mean, the top 5 games ever sold on PS4 are NOT first party titles. And Microsoft wins in every other department; Game Pass, Backwards Compatibility, EA Access, UltraHD bluray player, Cross-online with PC & Switch, Play Anywhere Program, Cross Chat & better online(?), ...etc Now, I don't own these consoles. I play on my PC. I'm just not fan of the idea that Microsoft did nothing this gen.",,Mr_ScissorsXIX,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Sony is winning the video gaming subscription market, according to a new report. PlayStation Now, the game streaming offering, brought in more than what the competitors — EA Access, Origin Access, and Xbox Game Pass — did put together.

From what you're saying it doesn't sound like they invested much into it though. So I guess the magnitude in which Google and Microsoft are doing this has not been tried before. It's been dabbled in by Sony. Nothing serious though. So I guess the question at this point is would Sony jump back in. I mean all 3 companies have an insane amount of brand recognition to people in the mobile market, though I would argue Google has the advantage due to android and honestly...Microsoft might be in 3rd place. Sure they got tablet in the Surface Pro and the often Windows phones. Now that I think about it though...Is Google trying to work on all devices with Google Stream? Or is it more just streaming games on Chrome? Which I suppose could also work on Android devices. MS is going to have to prove to the world that they can get xCloud to work on mobile devices too, because that's waaaay harder to do than streaming on a PC or console just purely due to the network connection.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network. -- http://www.bleacherreview.com/2018/11/microsoft-reports-record-q1-results-as.html",,bleacherreview,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

Microsoft have invested 10's of billions into it's cloud network and it's taken them probably a good decade to roll out to where it sits now. If Microsoft deliver on next gen to any device Sony will have a long scramble to catch up. The future of being able to plug any device say the phone in your pocket into the TV in a hotel or a friends, or just the TV its self with an xbox app and pairing an xbox control and being able to play the latest games on release will make who ever gets this right billions.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city’s demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015.



According to the Chicago Tribune, the city’s amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city’s demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was “illegal and discriminatory”. The company isn’t paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court.

Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the city’s favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court.

Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the city’s Law Department, told the Tribune that the city “uniformly enforces the amusement tax,” and neglected to address the outcry.

“If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,” he said.

The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

As the city grows increasingly desperate, there’s still room for the problem to get worse. As ratings agencies have demonstrated, the city’s pension funding projections consistently err on the unrealistically optimistic. According to a Moody’s report, the true magnitude of the unfunded liabilities facing the city is closer to $130 billion.



What other reason could there be for discouraging one of the safest forms of entertainment in a city where the murder rate is spiking?

A 9% amusement tax. Absolutely insane.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

Or did they themselves declare a dollar value attributed to game streaming or streaming services? It’s hard to call it a revolution when it’s barely a drop in the sea. Most people I know and the general sentiment of this forum is that most people are very resistant to the idea of streaming vs local play. (Myself included) There is no revolution yet. This is all the cars starting their ignitions and revving up for the race. It’s way too early to compare services, especially when comparing vastly different services to be calling one a winner.

If so, my money is on Google. MS's plan's, from what I understand, involves people buying special hardware for their streaming service. This will reduce latency a bit and improve picture quality. OTOH, Google's competing service doesn't, as long as it runs chrome it'll be able to stream. So, my money is on Google and it has nothing to do with their owning servers worldwide. Vast majority will not buy new hardware for slight increase in quality. As far as needing to own a global server network for a streaming service, that is bollocks. Netflix doesn't have one. Youtube didn't for the longest time. psnow doesn't. Nvidia game service doesn't. And Nintendo streamed RE7 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey to their Japanese customers despite not owning Japan-wide farms. So, if you are arguing that a company needs their own server infrastructure in order to make games playable, well that is false. Or is it that the global infrastructure is needed in order to make it cheap enough? Possible I guess. Netflix and Youtube don't stream games and PSNow is crap. So either you beef up to compete with Microsoft, Amazon and Google or you get left in the dust. I'm not arguing that they need their own infrastructure. I'm arguing that if you want to compete in quality to what is being put on the table by other companies...you need your own infrastructure. Top 10 cloud services. Sony is no where to be seen. https://clutch.co/cloud Last edited: Today at 6:47 PM",,Jigsaah,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

This is likely due to the sheer install base of the PlayStation 4, which stands at over 86m units sold since its November 2013 launch. Second place - by some way - is EA Access on Xbox One with a 16 per cent slice of the pie, while Xbox Game Pass claims 15 per cent of the sector's cash."" ""Though the subscription model clearly works for the video games space, it certainly raises questions over how we judge the success of individual games. For example, Microsoft has announced positive launches for Sea of Thieves, State of Decay 2 and Forza Horizon 4 with some impressive early player figures, but these titles are part of its Xbox Game Pass and Play Anywhere schemes, making it less obvious how many people have actually splashed the cash on these titles. In addition, player figures don't mean a huge amount when someone could have logged in to Rare's pirate romp once and never gone back.""

Now, we see the actual revenue and we can again see why Micosoft is moving Game Pass to PC (following all of their first party titles). It is because install base is king. And if you want to compete with that insane install base, you can't do it even if you technically offer the ""better"" service (Day one first party games. You're never getting Spider-Man day one on PSNow). The question now becomes, can Microsoft's specialty streaming service compete with the ""failure"" that is PSNow? We can assume Microsoft wants a do-over on install base so that service will most likely come to phones and anything else they can get it on, which may even the playing field but we shall see. Yep, there's no way PSNow is ever going to get new releases day and date with the console version. People mislead others and themselves by constantly associating PSNow with BC but it was never ever about BC, it was about untethering gaming from specific hardware.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

PlayStation Owners in Chicago will be Taxed Extra for Game Rentals

Posted by Madeline Ricchiuto November 11, 2018  Comment 





Starting Wednesday, PlayStation owners in the city of Chicago will need to pay an extra 9% tax on some purchases due to the city’s Amusement Tax. A ruling back in 2015 by the city’s department of finance extended the Amusement Tax to cover streaming content as well as more traditional forms of entertainment. On Wednesday, Sony will begin complying with that ruling for PlayStation owners in Chicago.

Polygon reports:

The tax applies to things like rentals, not full sales of video games (where other sales taxes would still apply). Chicago, like many cities, has had an amusement tax for years, and last year moved to increase it (which the public detested) to help shore up a budget deficit.

A ruling in 2015 by the city’s department of finance extended the tax to charges for streaming content — including movies, music and games — paid by customers in the city. It has since been called the “cloud tax,” “Netflix tax,” and even the “Hamilton tax” after the blockbuster musical.

It’s important to note this is for rentals, not full sales, which would already be subject to local and state sales taxes that PlayStation began collecting back in 2016.

PlayStation users with a billing address in the city got a notice this week saying the tax would be applied toward transactions on all of the PlayStation Store’s streaming and rental offerings — PlayStation Plus, Now, Vue, Music, Video on Demand and Video Live Events.

The tax will only affect rental sales, as full game sales are already subject to local and state taxes thanks to a PlayStation Store update in 2016. The tax will affect all users with a billing address in the city of Chicago. The tax will be applied toward transactions on all of the PlayStation Store’s streaming and rental services including PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Now, Video on Demand, Video Live Events, Music, and even PlayStation Vue.

The tax is not without its opponents as Apple sued the city back in August, calling the tax unconstitutional. The Apple suit is still in arbitration.

According to a new report from industry research group Superdata, the leading subscription services combined to bring in about $273 million in revenue during the third quarter of the year. The group determined that most of that revenue (52%) was accounted for by Sony's PlayStation Now service, which it said brought in $143 million for the quarter. EA's collection of PC and console services--EA Access, Origin Access, and Origin Access Premier--combined to bring in about $90 million, with a little over half of that coming from EA Access and the Origin offerings splitting the remainder. Interestingly, the new Premier tier of Origin Access brought in slightly more than the basic Origin Access tier, even though it was only launched partway through the quarter. Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass brought up the rear among the major offerings with roughly $41 million in revenue, a little less than EA Access but more than either of the Origin programs. Although these services together combined for just 6% of overall non-free-to-play console and PC revenue for the quarter, Superdata noted that consumers of other media have already shown a pronounced shift toward getting their entertainment through subscriptions. It said that in the US, 74% of people who spend on digital video do it through services like Netflix and Hulu instead of purchasing the shows and movies they want a la carte. For music, 64% of digital customers have subscriptions for services like Spotify or Apple Music, compared to 51% who buy their music directly from storefronts like iTunes. Unlike those other forms of media, games also have the advantage of selling add-on content to users of subscription services, and Superdata found subscribers more willing to do so. On average, subscribers to game services spend $25 a month on in-game content, compared to $10 for non-subscribers. And even with the subscriptions, those users are spending $57 a month on full game purchases, compared to the non-subscriber average of $39. https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articl...quarter-report",,wraggster,United Kingdom,East Midlands,Nottingham,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,PlayStation Now brought in $143 million last quarter - Report,,,

I can't play in the living room when my kids are sleeping, and I really want to play Red Dead 2 after work. Remote play for my PS4 is nearly flawless. It streams even over wifi at 720p with an extremely smooth framerate. When my Xbox is connected over an ethernet cable or through wifi, the streaming quality is pretty terrible. The sound cuts in and out, and there are times where the games lag and freeze. I have noticed that certain games are worse than others. GTA V is honestly not that bad, but Red Dead 2 is so terrible it's pretty much unplayable. And I have to play all of the games on the medium setting or below for anything to even work at all. How can I improve this? My guess would be that PS4 Remote Play streams over the Internet while Xbox streams only over my local network. While it ideally would be faster for my router to handle the streaming, I'm assuming Sony's streaming network is pretty robust (given all of their investment in Playstation Now).

179780325310,11/5/2018,http://us-afprelaxnews-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/179780325310,"Video games are following television and music into the cloud, with console-quality play on its way to being a streaming service as easy to access as Netflix or Spotify.

Computing power in data centers and devices from televisions to smartphones has surged and streaming technology has advanced, providing tools to break blockbuster titles from confines of consoles or personal computers.

During a recent Microsoft earnings call, chief executive Satya Nadella said a keenly anticipated “X Cloud” video game streaming service is in “early days” but he is excited by the prospect of giving players access console-quality titles on all kinds of internet-linked devices.

“Most critical is having a platform where gamers are already there,” Nadella said, noting booming revenue from its Xbox console unit.

“I am most excited about the core (Xbox) community and content we have; I think that is what even gives us permission to think about streaming.”

Video game titan Electronic Arts (EA) this week laid out a vision of streaming video games enhanced with artificial intelligence to create “living, breathing worlds that constantly evolve.”

EA, maker of the popular Battlefield and FIFA game franchises, has more than 1,000 employees working on a platform to harness the power of cloud computing and artificial intelligence in a game service hosted on the California-based company’s servers, according to chief technology officer Ken Moss.

The effort is called “Project Atlas.”

“I strongly believe that what’s on the horizon will bring greater changes than anything gaming has ever seen,” Moss said in a blog post disclosing Atlas.

“You will be able to play games with your friends anytime, anywhere and on any device.”

- ‘Assassin’s Creed’ in the cloud -
Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter saw Amazon, Apple and Google as potential big players in the space given huge investments they have made in data centers that already provide cloud services to millions of people.

Amazon, a major cloud operator through its Amazon Web Services, also owns popular game play-streaming service Twitch.

Google is collaborating with French video game colossus Ubisoft to use the latest addition to the hit “Assassin’s Creed” franchise to test “Project Stream” technology for hosting the kind of quick, seamless play powered by in-home consoles as an online service.

“We’re going to push the limits with one of the most demanding applications for streaming – a blockbuster video game,” Google product manager Catherine Hsiao said in a blog post.

A select number of people in the US can play “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” streamed to Chrome browsers on desktop or laptop computers.

Console quality video game play streamed online as a service, hosted on servers in the internet cloud, faces challenges including moving data quickly enough to avoid lags in action or imagery.

Improvements in internet bandwidth, computing power and data storage capabilities are enabling “disruptive technologies” such as streaming that can change the way games are created as well as played, according to Ubisoft.

- Consoles in crosshairs? -
Companies interested in cloud gaming see it as a way to reach broader audiences.

Microsoft has built a powerful platform for hosting computing in the internet cloud, making such service a thriving part of its business.

The Redmond, Washington-based technology veteran has also invested heavily in machine learning.

“If you agree that the eventual future of games consumption is through cloud gaming services, then those companies with a strong position in cloud are likely to be best placed to benefit from the transition,” said IHS Markit games technology research director Piers Harding-Rolls at an industry event earlier this year.

Sony offers more limited cloud service through its Playstation Now, keeping game play within the confines of the console.

While streaming game services might nibble at consoles sales, they are more likely to broaden the audience of players to anyone with an internet connection, according to analysts.

“I don’t think this means the death of the console,” Pachter said.

“Publishers need consoles the same way movie studios need theaters.”

A question unanswered what business model will prove optimal for game streaming services.

“It seems to me that the right business model is iTunes rather than Spotify,” Pachter said.

“Let people 'buy’ a game and stream it for as long as they want instead of forcing them to sign up for a subscription.”",,us-afprelaxnews-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Video game action heads for the cloud,Post,,

You'd think by now people would get the point that the XB1 isn't competition at all to PS4, it has totally dropped out of the race and MS has thrown the towel this gen.

I would just make a habit every time i went to level up before i did something dangerous to spend all the 'left over' currency on buying blood vials, no matter if i needed them or not. it adds up very nicely sitting in the bank until i die and need them. once you get multiple levels and xp costs are very high you will have even more to spend on vials. ====================::==================== Hello, thread. So as a Souls fan without a PS4, I kind of resigned myself to never playing Bloodborne. But then PSNow comes along and it actually works pretty well so I've been able to play it! I've been reading some spoiler things so I would know how to get to Cainhurst and such but mostly avoiding this thread, but I have a story I feel I need to share. ]One of the things I read about was how to be friends with Djura, which I wanted to do. So I fight Darkbeast Paarl and I had a lot of trouble with him, he keeps jumping around makes it hard and my main weapon is the Tontius which isn't effective against him, so I have to use an alternate. I spend probably 40 or so Blood vials to kill him, trying a couple different times until I level up, but I finally do it. So then I go through the back door, run around Old Yharnam getting chased by beasts to get to Djura. But I accidently miss going up his ladder and walk in front him so he starts shooting at me, and he accidentally hurt one of the beasts. Oh well, I find the ladder and go up thinking maybe we can still be friends, but he just shoots me with his shotgun and i let him kill me hoping I can try again and befriend him. So I go the same way, run from the beasts again and go up the ladder without getting shot at. I get to the top hoping he'll be friendly but instead of Djura I just see an item. I pick it up and it's the Poder Keg Hunters badge. He must have accidently jumped off the tower after killing me! I just wanted to be your friend Djura! Overall I'm really enjoying the game. As a souls fan who also likes Gothic and Cosmic Horror the game was pretty much made for me.

179780688308,11/5/2018,http://afprelaxnews-com-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/179780688308,"Video games are following television and music into the cloud, with console-quality play on its way to being a streaming service as easy to access as Netflix or Spotify.

Computing power in data centers and devices from televisions to smartphones has surged and streaming technology has advanced, providing tools to break blockbuster titles from confines of consoles or personal computers.

During a recent Microsoft earnings call, chief executive Satya Nadella said a keenly anticipated “X Cloud” video game streaming service is in “early days” but he is excited by the prospect of giving players access console-quality titles on all kinds of internet-linked devices.

“Most critical is having a platform where gamers are already there,” Nadella said, noting booming revenue from its Xbox console unit.

“I am most excited about the core (Xbox) community and content we have; I think that is what even gives us permission to think about streaming.”

Video game titan Electronic Arts (EA) this week laid out a vision of streaming video games enhanced with artificial intelligence to create “living, breathing worlds that constantly evolve.”

EA, maker of the popular Battlefield and FIFA game franchises, has more than 1,000 employees working on a platform to harness the power of cloud computing and artificial intelligence in a game service hosted on the California-based company’s servers, according to chief technology officer Ken Moss.

The effort is called “Project Atlas.”

“I strongly believe that what’s on the horizon will bring greater changes than anything gaming has ever seen,” Moss said in a blog post disclosing Atlas.

“You will be able to play games with your friends anytime, anywhere and on any device.”

- ‘Assassin’s Creed’ in the cloud -
Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter saw Amazon, Apple and Google as potential big players in the space given huge investments they have made in data centers that already provide cloud services to millions of people.

Amazon, a major cloud operator through its Amazon Web Services, also owns popular game play-streaming service Twitch.

Google is collaborating with French video game colossus Ubisoft to use the latest addition to the hit “Assassin’s Creed” franchise to test “Project Stream” technology for hosting the kind of quick, seamless play powered by in-home consoles as an online service.

“We’re going to push the limits with one of the most demanding applications for streaming – a blockbuster video game,” Google product manager Catherine Hsiao said in a blog post.

A select number of people in the US can play “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” streamed to Chrome browsers on desktop or laptop computers.

Console quality video game play streamed online as a service, hosted on servers in the internet cloud, faces challenges including moving data quickly enough to avoid lags in action or imagery.

Improvements in internet bandwidth, computing power and data storage capabilities are enabling “disruptive technologies” such as streaming that can change the way games are created as well as played, according to Ubisoft.

- Consoles in crosshairs? -
Companies interested in cloud gaming see it as a way to reach broader audiences.

Microsoft has built a powerful platform for hosting computing in the internet cloud, making such service a thriving part of its business.

The Redmond, Washington-based technology veteran has also invested heavily in machine learning.

“If you agree that the eventual future of games consumption is through cloud gaming services, then those companies with a strong position in cloud are likely to be best placed to benefit from the transition,” said IHS Markit games technology research director Piers Harding-Rolls at an industry event earlier this year.

Sony offers more limited cloud service through its Playstation Now, keeping game play within the confines of the console.

While streaming game services might nibble at consoles sales, they are more likely to broaden the audience of players to anyone with an internet connection, according to analysts.

“I don’t think this means the death of the console,” Pachter said.

“Publishers need consoles the same way movie studios need theaters.”

A question unanswered what business model will prove optimal for game streaming services.

“It seems to me that the right business model is iTunes rather than Spotify,” Pachter said.

“Let people 'buy’ a game and stream it for as long as they want instead of forcing them to sign up for a subscription.”",,afprelaxnews-com-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Video game action heads for the cloud,Post,,

If game streaming grows to become a large market and PSNow is the beachhead that allows Sony to compete with much bigger players in that market, it'll look very smart in retrospect.

So if you’re one that plays a lot of games, PlayStation Now is going to be a really good option for you. Not only do you get access to a ton of PlayStation 4 games, but you can also play some of the classic PS2 and PS3 games on your PlayStation 4 console, which makes this pretty invaluable.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

179785173799,11/5/2018,http://bleacherreview.tumblr.com/post/179785173799,"By Anthony Watt /             Nov 4, 2018 3:32 PM




 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

Imo DS1 paints the best picture of what a Souls game should be. The other games do certain things better, but Dark Souls is the complete package. Great level design, memorable boss encounters, rich atmosphere, interesting lore and characters you actually care about. I’d say DeS did all those things too, but imo DS1 did it all a little bit better. I got really interested in the lore when playing through DS1 and it ended up becoming my favourite thing about the game. It’s also why I enjoyed DS2- I went into that game expecting a new story with lots of hints about the first game for me to find, and it delivered that. I played DeS just after finishing DS2, then bought SotFS when it came out, then played DS3 and I am currently nearly finished with Bloodborne (I’m playing it on my PC on PSNow which is great, but my internet connection is really shaky so sometimes it plays just fine, sometimes it looks terrible and sometimes it doesn’t play at all).

From what you're saying it doesn't sound like they invested much into it though. So I guess the magnitude in which Google and Microsoft are doing this has not been tried before. It's been dabbled in by Sony. Nothing serious though. So I guess the question at this point is would Sony jump back in. I mean all 3 companies have an insane amount of brand recognition to people in the mobile market, though I would argue Google has the advantage due to android and honestly...Microsoft might be in 3rd place. Sure they got tablet in the Surface Pro and the often Windows phones. Now that I think about it though...Is Google trying to work on all devices with Google Stream? Or is it more just streaming games on Chrome? Which I suppose could also work on Android devices. Sony invested in it, they have a service in market and the client apps on all devices were in market. They have the most experience and data from it so yes it HAS been tried before on a much bigger global scale than either project stream or xcloud. Google is currenly in beta. US only. It actually does not officially support any devices other than PC Chrome. Not even chromecast. Same with xCloud, US only and the beta isn't even started yet to get officially supported devices. There are no official confirmed plans to support other countries or devices for Project stream as far as I know so what magnitude is there that has never been tried before?

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

I might be a little biased toward gamepass because downloads+launch day exclusives+backward compatiblity make for a bigger (and better) library than excluding all those ps3 games I can't play on my side of the globe (and I understand the geographical problems + why they can't emulate ps3 games)... but seeing Sony hasn't added any PS3 games on PSNow the last three months and is discountinuing those games on PSPlus from march 2019 onwards I feel confident that the downloadable PS4 library will be more than worth the 80usd I spent on it right now.

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== To the liberal Chicongo city government?

179940824518,11/9/2018,http://mrtylercosgrove.tumblr.com/post/179940824518,"During Nintendo’s most recent financial report, the company’s relatively new president Shuntaro Furukawa took questions from investors on the company’s performance and future plans. One investor pointed out to Furukawa that there are many big games that are missing from the Switch; while he did not name any titles specifically, it is logical to assume he means games like Red Dead Redemption II, which sold 17 million copies in its first week. Furukawa’s answer was blunt: some things just won’t come to Switch and that’s an unrealistic expectation.

“We believe that giving consumers a wide selection of software is an extremely important part of operating our platforms,” Furukawa said in the English translation of the Q&A provided by Nintendo. ""That is why we welcome the introduction of a variety of titles from many different software publishers. Even so, I do not think it is realistic to expect that every major title will become available on Nintendo Switch. We are speaking with publishers about them actively putting titles on Nintendo Switch that would be an especially good fit for its unique features as a home console system you can carry around, including handheld mode and the ability to bring systems together for local multiplayer. Given the strong publisher support Nintendo Switch has, I would expect the number of titles on it will increase a lot more. That is what really keeps the Nintendo Switch business on the right track.“

While the Switch has indeed gotten better third party support than most Nintendo home consoles, there are still a number notable of games that pass the system by, whether it be due to technological limitations or a market reasons. Bethesda, as an example, has shown a willingness to try and make it work with titles like Doom Eternal and Wolfenstein, but has also said that there are limits to what can be done on the system in the case of games like Fallout 76.

Later, Furukawa points out that the currently Japan-exclusive cloud service to stream third party games is another option. That service has been used for Resident Evil VII and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey so far in a similar method to, as examples, Google’s Project Stream and PlayStation Now, but physical distance from the servers makes the titles unplayable outside of Japan. It is unknown if Nintendo plans to ever bring that method, and thus the necessary servers, westward.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

179783264739,11/5/2018,http://jamiiewong.tumblr.com/post/179783264739,"Video games are following television and music into the cloud, with console-quality play on its way to being a streaming service as easy to access as Netflix or Spotify.

Computing power in data centers and devices from televisions to smartphones has surged and streaming technology has advanced, providing tools to break blockbuster titles from confines of consoles or personal computers.

During a recent Microsoft earnings call, chief executive Satya Nadella said a keenly anticipated “X Cloud” video game streaming service is in “early days” but he is excited by the prospect of giving players access console-quality titles on all kinds of internet-linked devices.

“Most critical is having a platform where gamers are already there,” Nadella said, noting booming revenue from its Xbox console unit.

“I am most excited about the core (Xbox) community and content we have; I think that is what even gives us permission to think about streaming.”

Video game titan Electronic Arts (EA) this week laid out a vision of streaming video games enhanced with artificial intelligence to create “living, breathing worlds that constantly evolve.”

EA, maker of the popular Battlefield and FIFA game franchises, has more than 1,000 employees working on a platform to harness the power of cloud computing and artificial intelligence in a game service hosted on the California-based company’s servers, according to chief technology officer Ken Moss.

The effort is called “Project Atlas.”

“I strongly believe that what’s on the horizon will bring greater changes than anything gaming has ever seen,” Moss said in a blog post disclosing Atlas.

“You will be able to play games with your friends anytime, anywhere and on any device.”

– ‘Assassin’s Creed’ in the cloud –

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter saw Amazon, Apple and Google as potential big players in the space given huge investments they have made in data centers that already provide cloud services to millions of people.

Amazon, a major cloud operator through its Amazon Web Services, also owns popular game play-streaming service Twitch.

Google is collaborating with French video game colossus Ubisoft to use the latest addition to the hit “Assassin’s Creed” franchise to test “Project Stream” technology for hosting the kind of quick, seamless play powered by in-home consoles as an online service.

“We’re going to push the limits with one of the most demanding applications for streaming — a blockbuster video game,” Google product manager Catherine Hsiao said in a blog post.

A select number of people in the US can play “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” streamed to Chrome browsers on desktop or laptop computers.

Console quality video game play streamed online as a service, hosted on servers in the internet cloud, faces challenges including moving data quickly enough to avoid lags in action or imagery.

Improvements in internet bandwidth, computing power and data storage capabilities are enabling “disruptive technologies” such as streaming that can change the way games are created as well as played, according to Ubisoft.

– Consoles in crosshairs? –

Companies interested in cloud gaming see it as a way to reach broader audiences.

Microsoft has built a powerful platform for hosting computing in the internet cloud, making such service a thriving part of its business.

The Redmond, Washington-based technology veteran has also invested heavily in machine learning.

“If you agree that the eventual future of games consumption is through cloud gaming services, then those companies with a strong position in cloud are likely to be best placed to benefit from the transition,” said IHS Markit games technology research director Piers Harding-Rolls at an industry event earlier this year.

Sony offers more limited cloud service through its Playstation Now, keeping game play within the confines of the console.

While streaming game services might nibble at consoles sales, they are more likely to broaden the audience of players to anyone with an internet connection, according to analysts.

“I don’t think this means the death of the console,” Pachter said.

“Publishers need consoles the same way movie studios need theaters.”

A question unanswered what business model will prove optimal for game streaming services.

“It seems to me that the right business model is iTunes rather than Spotify,” Pachter said.

“Let people ‘buy’ a game and stream it for as long as they want instead of forcing them to sign up for a subscription.”

And I don’t see them ever going back down that road again. Meaning, the next system will be the exact same basic architecture as the ps4 pro...just more powerful. Meaning...the next new PlayStation will be fully backwards compatable to the ps4 (and play games from all previous PlayStations) Therefore, there is no reasonable need to differentiate their systems with numbers any more. PlayStation going forward needs to inform consumers that PlayStation systems from now on will be all encompassing, a pervasive ecosystem, not a complete cutoff from previous gens like before. They need to position the PlayStation system as a new brand of gaming system going forward. The future is that every new PlayStation system you buy, it plays all past PlayStation games as well. Either through disc access, or PsNow downloads/streaming. I have a hunch they want to try and differentiate the “ps5” from the ps4 pro. Naming it something else besides a iteration number will get people’s attention about what PlayStation systems will be now. There is no reason to NOT drop the numeral iteration on their home console at this point. They don’t need the 5 for some kind of brand recognition or market awareness. I don’t think anyone feels the Vita bombed because it wasn’t called the psp2? Click to expand... You did not provide any good reasons why it won't be called PS5. You are getting lost in the weeds instead of thinking of the general branding for the mass market and what has worked perfectly so far.

So I went through and it asked me to choose which payment I wanted to do. £12.99 a month of £84.99 a year and once again on top of the prices it said “7 day free trial”. I chose the year one because that’s the one I’d most likely do after the trial. It asked me to accept everything so I did and then popped up saying “you now have access to over 500 games”. I thought that’s cool let’s play . Then my phone beep (pop up from PayPal) it said I Paid Sony £84.99. Slightly confused to I sent a message to Sony via there website and was told to wait for a reply. Today I got on back (which I thought was pretty quick) and it said I was denied a refund.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network. -- http://www.bleacherreview.com/2018/11/microsoft-reports-record-q1-results-as.html",,bleacherreview,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

So quickly? You do realize Microsoft has been working on the cloud for gaming since before Titanfall 1 right? That's like what, 4, 5 years at least. Sure it wasn't for streaming specifically but they also said they would only do this if the main problem people have with streaming is resolved. The Latency. Now they announce xCloud. Microsoft used to get a TON of shit for their claims of their cloud gaming making the original Xbox One as powerful as the PS4 (flat out wrong, by the way). However I think when they realized what they had on their hands with the Xbox One X and looming competition from the likes of Google, the purpose and goal of their cloud system changed dramatically. Project xCloud seems to be the result of this. Now mind you, this particular part is pure speculation on my behalf. I don't know any of this for a fact, I'm just discussing this. However Sony hasn't given me anything to go off in terms of what direction they might take. The last update with PSNow is basically copying what Game Pass has been able to let you do from its onset. Streaming is still a possibility, but it's still crap and there's no mention of plans of improvement at this point. I mean my word isn't written in gold or anything. If I'm wrong, show me?

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Gotta find that $ for welfare...

179859123970,11/7/2018,http://brieflydeepestdreamer.tumblr.com/post/179859123970,"Why We Need to Remember the Art of ‘Obsolete’ Video Game Consoles https://ift.tt/2RF08Ej 
Last month Google launched Project Stream, which lets players play the latest  Assassin’s Creed title in a web browser—no game console, not even a download file. 

By many accounts, the service worked pretty well. Google isn’t alone in taking a crack at streaming games, either. Microsoft has also announced Project xCloud, which holds similar aspirations. It seems that for an increasing number of tech companies, playing games over a stream—as opposed to purchasing expensive consoles that eventually become obsolete—is the way of the future. 

Whether you buy into that hype or not, the release of the new book  The Game Console: A Photographic History from Atari to Xbox, amid this push toward a console-less reality feels quite prescient. The book is billed as a work of photographic preservation, but it also reads as an inherent defense of the game console just as its under threat. While services like PlayStation Now prove that streaming has the potential to increase access to older hardware-bound games,  The Game Console posits that consoles themselves are important cultural objects that we shouldn’t forget. 

 The Game Console was born out of author-photographer Evan Amos’ gaming hardware documentation project on Wikipedia. Disappointed by the quality of video game console images on the site, Amos set out to make and upload his own and ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to help him do just that. Even if you’re not familiar with Amos by name, you’ve almost certainly seen his work. Search the name of any game console on Google and at least one of Amos’ photos is bound to be in the top three results. 
Image: Evan Amos 
It’s not easy work. According to Amos, doing his particular brand of preservation can come with a price tag. 

“If there’s something that I need for the collection, I have to spend my own money on it,” he explained. “I do pick them up when I can, but [most of what’s absent from the book] are European or Japanese computers, which are very expensive to have shipped to America.” He’s accumulated so much hardware to document that he’s running out of space in his apartment, he said.

Above all,  The Game Console makes the case that these mostly-bygone gaming boxes are worth remembering, and that there may be something of value lost if we were to fully transition to a streaming-only future. 

Unique consoles can have unique interfaces, for instance. Take the Coleco Telstar Arcade, which featured built-in controls (twin paddles, a steering wheel, and a toy revolver) on each side of its triangular design. Emulating Telstar Arcade games with a PC instead of the physical console removes a core element of the original games’ designs. 

Whether Telstar Arcade games are any good is another story, but as a cultural artifact, the console itself and dozens of other pieces of video game hardware featured in  The Game Console remind us that just because technology is “obsolete,” that doesn’t mean it can’t still hold significant cultural value.

Don't let it frustrate you too much, but don't slam your head in to the wall for the sake of it, take a break if needs be Vials were never a problem for me past the first area. I would just make a habit every time i went to level up before i did something dangerous to spend all the 'left over' currency on buying blood vials, no matter if i needed them or not. it adds up very nicely sitting in the bank until i die and need them. once you get multiple levels and xp costs are very high you will have even more to spend on vials. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Hello, thread. So as a Souls fan without a PS4, I kind of resigned myself to never playing Bloodborne. But then PSNow comes along and it actually works pretty well so I've been able to play it! I've been reading some spoiler things so I would know how to get to Cainhurst and such but mostly avoiding this thread, but I have a story I feel I need to share. ]One of the things I read about was how to be friends with Djura, which I wanted to do. So I fight Darkbeast Paarl and I had a lot of trouble with him, he keeps jumping around makes it hard and my main weapon is the Tontius which isn't effective against him, so I have to use an alternate. I spend probably 40 or so Blood vials to kill him, trying a couple different times until I level up, but I finally do it. So then I go through the back door, run around Old Yharnam getting chased by beasts to get to Djura. But I accidently miss going up his ladder and walk in front him so he starts shooting at me, and he accidentally hurt one of the beasts. Oh well, I find the ladder and go up thinking maybe we can still be friends, but he just shoots me with his shotgun and i let him kill me hoping I can try again and befriend him. So I go the same way, run from the beasts again and go up the ladder without getting shot at. I get to the top hoping he'll be friendly but instead of Djura I just see an item. I pick it up and it's the Poder Keg Hunters badge. He must have accidently jumped off the tower after killing me! I just wanted to be your friend Djura! Overall I'm really enjoying the game. As a souls fan who also likes Gothic and Cosmic Horror the game was pretty much made for me. PSNow has also worked surprisingly well, I have died due to lag sometimes but it is impressive that it can handle this. Dang. That's exactly how I killed him, except when I did it I meant for him to die.",,LD50,United States of America,,,Positive,Sadness,Forums,,,,,"[Bloodborne] ""Behold! A Paleblood sky!"" 67",,,

179890410494,11/8/2018,http://freeoceanofamespcgames.tumblr.com/post/179890410494,"With the advent of the likes of PlayStation Now, Xbox Game Pass, and EA Origin Access, it’s clear that Netflix-style game streaming subscription services are increasing in popularity, and are going to continue to grow. Many have claimed that such services might result in lower sales for games, or just less money spent on games in general, but according to a new report by SuperData, that doesn’t seem to be the case.

According to SuperData, consumers in the US who have subscriptions to such services are, on average, still spending 45 per cent more money on games than those without subscriptions do, while they’re also spending more than twice as much on in-game content. Average monthly spending on games for subscribers in the US stands at $57.15, while the same for non-subscribers is at $39.21. Meanwhile, subscribers spend an average of $25.18 per month on in-game content, as opposed to $10.36 spent by non-subscribers.

“Subscribers still spend an average of 45% more on full-priced games than non-subscribers,” the report reads. “Gaming subscription appeals to devoted fans who spend heavily on their hobby. Since more casual players already have ample access to free-to-play content, getting this segment of the audience to pay a regular monthly fee for games is a harder sell.”

Meanwhile, as far as in-game purchases by subscribers are concerned, character skins and cosmetics seem to be the most popular, amounting for 37% of all subscribers purchasing these, with season passes following behind at 30%. Meanwhile, story-based DLC packs are in sixth place, purchased by 25% of all subscribers, behind map packs at 26%.

“Subscribers spend $25 a month on in-game content such as season passes, battle passes, cosmetic items and story-based content,” the report reads. “As subscribers gain access to a large collection of games, they are more likely to play them, and in turn purchase more in-game content.”

Meanwhile, the report also states that top subscription services amounted for 6% of the overall premium PC and console revenue in the US in Q3 2018, with a quarterly revenue of $273 million. PlayStation Now made up for 52% of this revenue, followed by 16% for EA Access, EA’s Xbox One-exclusive subscription service. Xbox Game Pass is at 15%, followed by Origin Access Premier and Origin Access at 9% and 8% respectively.

PSNow is several years old, double the price per month of Xbox Game Pass and had to claw its way to where it is now. Game Pass is still in the very early stages of its life. It's doing great, all things considered. You know you don't own any of the games you buy, right? You own a license that can be rescinded for a variety of reasons, at any time. I mean, I already watch all my visual media (movies, series, etc) in subscription format, so why is this so much different? Instead of paying 100s of Euros a month for physical versions of movies and series, I pay roughly 20 Euro between Netflix and Amazon and get to watch literally thousands. I'd be happy to pay even 60 Euro a month for a gaming subscription instead of 60 euro per game. 10 Euro for Game Pass is ridiculously good value. It's fine if you're not a fan of subscription models, but why get so upset that other people don't feel the same as you? Owning a game on disc is different than renting it month to month. I shouldn't have to explain the difference between the two to gamers. You think I'm upset. And I think you're bending over for corporate greed. That's a difference of opinion for ya.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== It’s expensive to pay the medical bills for all those shot-up ghetto-n*ggers.

My original point was that MS is failing to make the XBOX One a must-have item. First, by not creating exclusive titles that you ***need to buy the platform to play,*** and second, by extending the playspace to the PC so ***you can play every XBOX title without any need to ever own an XBOX One***. It wasn’t “why people buy consoles over PCs”, as you state in most of the top of the comment. I’ve agreed with you multiple times and talked at length about the versatility of computers and the ease and price of consoles. 2. The comparison of console vs. console is more appropriate, because we’re talking about reasons to buy an XBOX One, not a PC. I keep making the analogy of two objects that serve the same purpose and the second making the first redundant and no longer distinctive/unique, because we’re talking about reasons to buy an XBOX One. I wrote at length about the apps and utilities and customization and personalization of PCs and all of those are advantages when comparing an XBOX One and a PC as far as what can do more for you, but the lowest common denominator is ***they both play XBOX games*** and that’s the ONLY point that I’m talking about. Everything else is just an argument to buy a PC. 3. To just make it as simple as I can, Microsoft is not delivering console exclusives. I think those are good. Sony thinks those are good. People are buying Playstations and Switches because of them. If MS can’t deliver equally noteworthy exclusives, and they’ve abandoned plans to create VR for their XB1X, then the XBOX One has very few things that you can’t get anywhere else. Game-wise, those things are primarily “Halo”, “Gears”, “Forza”, and “Crackdown”. And because of their Play Anywhere philosophy, all of those will be available on a PC, further making the XBOX One less unique, desirable, and necessary to satisfy those purchasing desires. I get your points, I do. I’ve agreed with you many times. But when it comes to Microsoft and first-party console exclusives, there’s an abyss. You can play every game on a PC due to Play Anywhere, and the vast majority of the games with the exception of a handful of AAA titles on the PS4 and Switch. It’s primary draws right now are backwards compatibility (for people that don’t buy new games), Play Anywhere (for people that would rather play XBOX games on their PC), and Game Pass (a better version of PSNow, but limited in the number of new exclusives that are included at the time of release because they’re limited by the fact that Microsoft isn’t creating new exclusives on par with Sony and Nintendo. And, by the way, you’re assuming that I play PC. I don’t. My gaming rig is gathering ten years worth of dust right now. Which is why I wish XBOX would focus on the ***CONSOLE*** side of things, as they have in previous generations (which made them successful).",,And_You_Like_It_Too,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network. -- http://www.bleacherreview.com/2018/11/microsoft-reports-record-q1-results-as.html",,bleacherreview,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

There are a number of green summer children (or worse, astroturfing poltards) linking this to ""Democrats"" and ""leftists."" Amusement taxes are common across the country, implemented at a city and state level, so this shit isn't new. Were you born yesterday? [https://revenue.alabama.gov/sales-use/tax-rates/](https://revenue.alabama.gov/sales-use/tax-rates/) is Alabama a leftist state since they've had a state-wide 4% amusement tax for quite a while? Christ. 2. The OP's title is misleading. It is not ""all video game purchases."" If you bother to read the legislation, you will find that it primarily targets any ticket-based or event-based activity, which is why they're calling it the ""Broadway/Hamilton"" act. Theatre tickets get fucked, so do sports tickets. 3. The intersection of this with video games is when digital online video game services resemble that of one-use tickets. This is why Playstation OnDemand and Playstation Now are listed. They are the equivalent of one-use amusement tickets, just like a theatre show. 4. If you buy a full video game in general, disc or digital, you are not affected by this tax. 5. This tax does not double-dip. You are not paying 10% sales tax plus 9% amusement tax here, because this is a replacement effect. 6. The only detail that makes Chicago's implementation of an amusement tax unique is that 9% is a fair bit higher than most other cities/states who seem to choose values between 4% and 6%. Additionally, as of 2015 with this same very law, Chicago taxes digital goods like TV and game services because internet based commerce has largely replaced meatspace commerce in the last 20 years. If you're still using a 56k modem in a rural area, you wouldn't understand. The city's lost a lot of revenue from the shift of commerce and it doesn't take a retard to realize that policy needs to be updated with technology.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc",,Mavrick,United Kingdom,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Chicago introduces 9% ""Cloud Tax"" for PlayStation Plus/Now Users",,,

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== Guess Spending less or stop overpromising civil servants fat retirements is not an option?",,Squid,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,GOV/MIL Tax games: Chicago PlayStation users furious at new city fee,,,

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

Specs, designs, hardware/software change all the time. I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt on the pro since it was practically the first word out about it iirc(correct me if I’m wrong) but everyone knows PS5 is coming. I just hope they don’t try something like the PS3’s cell processor. PS4 BC is a given, so should Blu-ray UHD. Curious about PS1-PS3, I’m hoping they at least enable BC for PS1/PS2 if the user has the physical disc(There’s PSNow otherwise) PS3 might be a pipe dream still.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Blue State problems.",,jsteinhauer,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Chicago introduces 9% ""Cloud Tax"" for PlayStation Plus/Now Users",,,

If so, my money is on Google. MS's plan's, from what I understand, involves people buying special hardware for their streaming service. This will reduce latency a bit and improve picture quality. OTOH, Google's competing service doesn't, as long as it runs chrome it'll be able to stream. So, my money is on Google and it has nothing to do with their owning servers worldwide. Vast majority will not buy new hardware for slight increase in quality. As far as needing to own a global server network for a streaming service, that is bollocks. Netflix doesn't have one. Youtube didn't for the longest time. psnow doesn't. Nvidia game service doesn't. And Nintendo streamed RE7 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey to their Japanese customers despite not owning Japan-wide farms. So, if you are arguing that a company needs their own server infrastructure in order to make games playable, well that is false. Or is it that the global infrastructure is needed in order to make it cheap enough? Possible I guess. Netflix and Youtube don't stream games and PSNow is crap. So either you beef up to compete with Microsoft, Amazon and Google or you get left in the dust. I'm not arguing that they need their own infrastructure. I'm arguing that if you want to compete in quality to what is being put on the table by other companies...you need your own infrastructure. Top 10 cloud services.

On consoles you will see a stop to hardware development and physical games and gaming will become an on demand service. You're already seeing this with PSNow. Want all the newest console games? That'll be $200/month please and you will be streaming them to your console from a rendering farm. I can't remember the name of the service but there are already companies doing this. Phones will become the primary gaming hardware that people use since almost everyone has one so that market is bigger than the traditional gaming market. Again, more complex games with better graphics can be streamed to your device that you control from your phone and the telecom companies also like this because you're data costs will go up.

Bethesda Is Getting Ready For StreamingBethesda Is Getting Ready For Streamingvideo games



The music, TV, and film industries are already heavily involved with streaming, and while the video game industry is an increasingly digital business, streaming adoption remains limited. That could change in the future, as some higher-ups in gaming believe viable and widespread game-streaming technology is close(ish) to becoming a reality.

Sony already operates a game-streaming service in the form of PlayStation Now, while Microsoft is working on its own game-streaming service. Electronic Arts is creating a streaming platform of its own, while Japanese gaming giant Capcom and Ubisoft are streaming some of their biggest games on Nintendo Switch in Japan–and Capcom specifically is planning to do more in the future.
Fallout 76
This is all to say that streaming is poised to become a bigger piece of the pie in the years ahead. Bethesda, the publisher of huge franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Rage, and many others, is preparing itself for a future where streaming is even more popular than it is now.

“Absolutely it is [going to be viable],” Bethesda marketing boss Pete Hines told GameSpot recently.

Bethesda’s numerous studios are already looking into how they can get ready for an industry that places more of an emphasis on streaming. Without any pressing on my part, Hines referenced “next-gen consoles” as it relates to streaming, which is intriguing given that one of rumours circling now is that one of the new Xbox consoles Microsoft is working on will be a streaming box.

“It’s absolutely something all of our studios have been involved in and looked at and thought about as we talk about what we do going forward,” Hines said. “Whether it’s where next-gen consoles are going, or what’s streaming is going to be like, or whatever. So yeah, it’s something that is on everybody’s radar and they think about as yet another platform essentially.”

Hines has already talked about how he knows “some stuff” about the next wave of new consoles, so his comments are all the more alluring with that context.

Streaming content like movies, music, and TV shows is considered generally easier from a technical standpoint because they are less involved in comparison to video games that have numerous different processes and under-the-hood wizardy happening. There is also the matter of input lag. It’s exciting to think about being able to stream a game like Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey in your browser, but any amount of significant input lag might turn people away. What’s more, streaming any kind of media requires a capable and consistent internet connection, which could pose problems for people in some parts of the world.
Rage 2
Services like PlayStation Now and Google’s Project Stream are already demonstrating that streaming is an exciting and viable proposition, but it is still early days. Physical media is not going away anytime soon, nor is playing games on local hardware. The second of Microsoft’s rumoured new Xbox consoles is a more traditional system that plays games locally, according to a report from Brad Sams, with the streaming box offered merely as an option for those who want it.

Hines’ new comments about streaming come after he talked about how he would like the industry to get to a place where you can buy a game and play it wherever you want. Andrew Wilson, the CEO of EA, said during a presentation recently that he sees a future where you can play games on any device you want, with streaming/cloud gaming help accelerate that shift. Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Rockstar Games parent company Take-Two Interactive, has said he believes streaming will help accelerate the industry’s transition away from “closed” systems.

Presumably companies like Bethesda, EA, Take-Two, and others are briefed on announcements before they are made public, so it’s intriguing to hear top executives at each company independently say much the same thing about where the industry and new consoles may be headed.

Video game streaming hasn’t been a total success story so far, as you may recall the OnLive service shut down before it ever got much of a foothold.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

BirdRock Gaming Chair

Although this isn’t technically an Xbox accessory, we think it’s a great item to have in your game room. Most gaming chairs stick out like a sore thumb and don’t blend in with your furniture, but not this option from BirdRock. 

It’s comfortable and supportive for gaming on the floor, and it is much better-looking than other options. Even better - it costs less than $100, making it an affordable and useful gift for yourself or the gamer in your life.

We like to always keep one battery charging while the other is in our controller, to ensure a low battery never gets in the way of gameplay.

If you’re not certain what game to gift to your friend or loved one, get them one of these gift cards instead. They come in a range of amounts from $10 to $100, but we recommend the $50 cards because most video games cost between $50 and 60. 

Although a gift card may feel like a cop-out, you can be sure you don’t accidentally give a gamer a game they already have.

You might also consider picking up a 12-month PlayStation Now deal that drops the price to $79.99 (also a discount of $20).

Once the PlayStation Plus membership is purchased, Amazon will send you a code, so there’s no physical card to deal with. All you need to do is pass the code on to the recipient and they can redeem it to extend their membership for an additional year on top of any time that is remaining on their current subscription. For the uninitiated, here are some of the benefits of a PlayStation Plus subscription:

On a relate note, the Black Friday $200 Spider-Man PS4 Slim bundle is expected to be widely available, but if you don’t want to take chances, your first opportunity to grab one will be right here at Walmart (online only) at 12am EST November 18th (they even have a countdown clock). It is also expected to arrive at GameStop and at Best Buy on the same date - most likely at midnight EST. You should also keep tabs on Amazon to see if they pull the trigger on the deal early.

Target’s weekly ad suggests that they will have the deal up and running online starting on the 18th, but this hasn’t been confirmed. Kohl’s is also selling it starting on November 19th at 12:01 am (with $60 Kohl’s cash bonus).

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

CPU and RAM
Sony claims that the PS4 is 10 times more powerful than the PS3. The PS3 uses a Sony-made Cell architecture that was criticised for being hard to develop , whereas the PS4 uses an x86-based chip , the same used in both Windows Pcs and Xbox One. The PS4 features an 8-core AMD Jaguar CPU (max 2.7GHz) with an 800MHz AMD Radeon GPU and 8GB of GDDR5 RAM compared to the PS3 which has a 3.2GHz single-core CPU 

PS4 vs PS3 Noise
The PS4 is silent compared to the PS3. The PS3 starts making noises when playing some high-level games

PS4 vs PS3 Controllers
The PS4’s new Dualshock 4 is slightly larger and heavier compared to its predecessor PS3. It’s shoulder and trigger buttons on the Dualshock 4 is redesigned and comes with elongated grips.

PS4 vs PS3 Media Skills

The PS3 allows videos to be stored on memory sticks or external hard drives , but the PS4 can only play MP4 files. The PS4 can only stream files through the “Plex” app whereas the PS3 can stream files wirelessy from other devices.

PS4 vs PS3 Backwards Compability
The PS4 has two ways of performing backwards compability. Playstation Now acts as a cloud-based streaming service that allows PS3 games to be played on the PS4 using the internet. The earlier PS3 models could play PS2 games because it contains the PS2 hardware inside. Software emulation allowed the lower end PS3 models to be played but with limited compability. The newer models of PS3 do not support PS2 games.",,timecapsulegame,Malaysia,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

On top of that, when I died and respawned, I attempted to get on my horse... only to be teleported to the bottom of the map (this also happened to me in Red Dead 1 Online). And for some reason, until I got to the MacFarlane ranch, when I saved the game I was treated to the game being a black screen, but audio was still playing, which forced me to relaunch the game. On the other hand, I found the game to be enjoyable after you get passed the game-breaking bugs Rockstar never fixed. >!Also, after Herbert Moon dies, me makes a demonic zombie sound that sounds an awful lot like he's saying Herbert Moon!<",,ChuckGreeneTiR,United States of America,,,Negative,Fear,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I'd also say that you should stop saying Sony has GaiKai. It's PSNOW, it's not GaiKai. Sony after buying that company has added their own engineers to that streaming sector and made it into something of their own. I realize that. I guess I'm calling it Gaikai because people don't associate PSNow with cloud computing generally. I suppose it's one in the same but it wasn't until recently that I realized this fact and I have a PS4 and subscribe to PSNow. Like Microsoft has ""Azure"". Most people know this. ""Google Cloud"". Amazon has ""Amazon Web Services"". I suppose me calling Sony's Gaikai is because I'm not familiar with an overall cloud service. I mean it's confusing. I did look it up and it looks like they have ""Sony Cloud Media"" but I'm not sure if it's meant to do gaming. Though I'll admit, Azure, Google and Amazon's services aren't exclusively for gaming either. So it's possible this Sony Cloud Media"" could be used for that but maybe they aren't ready to present it in this manner yet?

I played about 2 hours of the original game (it was buggy af on Playstation Now) so I didn't have the connection some players might. All I can say is that it was one of the best games I've ever played. The open world is truly open (once you get there). The story is engaging and emotional (again, once it gets started). I think there are two main problems with the folks who don't like it (setting aside those who have issues about the game not being a Brokeback Simulator): Horse Fatigue and It's SOOO Slow. You ride your horse A LOT. More than you drive cars in GTA. Learn to use the Cinematic Camera and what that means to travel. It makes a HUGE difference. Hands Free riding makes the Horse Fatigue a lot less. The story IS slow. It's a 40 HOUR MOVIE. The characters take time to get to know. The game mechanics take time to learn (and not well explained in a couple of parts!). But it's worth sticking with. I haven't had such an emotional reaction to a game since Mass Effect. In spite of the hate, it's my Game Of The Year unless something amazing happens in the next 2 months. And that's weird because Westerns are so not my thing. But if you like Open World, you like a compelling story, you like compelling characters and you want to play an amazing game, I'd say yeah.",,GaymerDaddy,United States of America,,,Positive,Unclassified,Reddit,,,,,,,,

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

According to market research firm.

PlayStation Now is generally given short shrift in gaming circles, with more attention placed on Microsoft’s heavily promoted Xbox Game Pass service. However, it seems Sony’s streaming and download subscription has been quietly bringing home the bacon, as new research from SuperData makes it the market leader by some margin – excluding services like PlayStation…

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Wh t?!?!

But it still missing on the new core games. IF God of War was on that, i would've already subscribed for a month :/ Thanks for correcting, me tho. So maybe the service grew a lot lately without anyone noticing or telling. Yeah I was really surprised by how much the service improved I tired it when it launched in the us and was really let down. But when I tried it recently it was really good, it was may more intuitive and user firendly and for the games I played barely any input lag. There's a lot to play and quite new games too I remember thay added Mafia 3 and Steep recently (2 games that I wanted to play). The annual cost of PSnow is cheaper than gamepass 100$ a year is really not that much, the other options a too expensive, f the service interest you just buy a year. I think that the diference between this and gamepass is the main goal: I think the goal of gamepass is to attract people to the Xbox ecosystem.People where leaving and they needed to look pro consumer, That's probably why all of the xbox exclusives are on it day one (it also seems to point to a future where xbox is only a service which would be logical and I think the best way for microsoft to make most money) plus it's not a huge loss for MS which is severely lacking in exclusives and can avoid losses ""thanks to"" microtransactions. The Psnow I think started as a way of allowing retrocompatibility the ps3 architecture makes it impossible to run on a ps4 and that's probably why it was awful at first.But as streaming services gained popularity and probably the EA access changed this idea of retrocompatibility to this little dose of crack that get you hooked you can play a lot of games just like gamepass but not exclusives or at least not so early just a few exclusives to make you buy the new ones, they won't cut their losses through microtransactions so just offer a bit and bet on the quality of the game to make people buy more. I think those are good decisions for both to capitalize on their strenghts.

They admit that your connection has a lot to do with the quality. I happen to have amazing internet. So yes, you're right, I can't speak for everyone. People who don't have at least a 10mb/sec connection will have trouble. I am hopeful however that if they are doing this right now at 10 mb/sec and I get 250mb/sec that this could be amazing for my specific situation. I think this is kinda beside the point though. Earlier in the thread, my argument was that Sony doesn't have anything right now to contend in this environment. They had cloud gaming, they were using Shinra. Then they shut it down in 2016. Why? Im not sure, but maybe it could be because they have a better solution. I mean PSNow is still available. It could also be because PSNow wasn't as popular as they would have liked. I think after they went the gamepass route and allow people to download the games PSNow became more popular, as it should. Still doesn't mean my original point is lacking merit My main issue with what you have been saying is the bolded.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Quote: : A near 10% tax is $1 for every $10 spent on game rentals relating to that post. That's pretty significant. Chicago must be hurting for more money as with many cities that overspend. If it's successful, I can imagine more cities following their example.

You made the claim, prove it. Now count how many Exclusives above 8.0 PS3 and XB360 had last gen and compare them to how many they have this gen. From a rough estimate from MC or GS it seems it appears to be far lower, especially for XB, but give us some accurate data on your claim. I can tell you which system has the biggest 8.0+ total library though, it's PC with over 100 games. Sorry, I should have specified. When I said console exclusivity is at its highest I was talking in terms of quality. The games released on console this generation are just amazing, this generation of gaming is way better than the last gen which is where PC really started to become a competitor. Quantity wise then yeah PC wins by far. PC exclusives tend to be MMO's or indie games, and all of the decent ones are just ported over to console eventually like Stardew Valley. Still though, I do wish we had some PS4 exclusives on PC. Bloodborne runs like ass on PS4 even though it's an exclusive, I hardly hit 25 FPS at best. Hopefully consoles step up their game next gen. And TBS, RTS, SIM. Not all the decent ones are ported, which is why PC has the most 8+ games by over 100 games. Bloodborne is on PC via PSNOW. Nearly all XB1X games are on PC. Most PS4 games on are on PC. Sorry, I don't understand the acronyms lmao. Nearly all XB1X games are on PC because Windows is owned by Microsoft, obviously. They need to keep people from ditching them and going to Apple don't they? I did say Xbox is lacking in the exclusive department in my original comment.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

179940873537,11/9/2018,http://lovingorcas.tumblr.com/post/179940873537,"During Nintendo’s most recent financial report, the company’s relatively new president Shuntaro Furukawa took questions from investors on the company’s performance and future plans. One investor pointed out to Furukawa that there are many big games that are missing from the Switch; while he did not name any titles specifically, it is logical to assume he means games like Red Dead Redemption II, which sold 17 million copies in its first week. Furukawa’s answer was blunt: some things just won’t come to Switch and that’s an unrealistic expectation.

“We believe that giving consumers a wide selection of software is an extremely important part of operating our platforms,” Furukawa said in the English translation of the Q&A provided by Nintendo. ""That is why we welcome the introduction of a variety of titles from many different software publishers. Even so, I do not think it is realistic to expect that every major title will become available on Nintendo Switch. We are speaking with publishers about them actively putting titles on Nintendo Switch that would be an especially good fit for its unique features as a home console system you can carry around, including handheld mode and the ability to bring systems together for local multiplayer. Given the strong publisher support Nintendo Switch has, I would expect the number of titles on it will increase a lot more. That is what really keeps the Nintendo Switch business on the right track.“

While the Switch has indeed gotten better third party support than most Nintendo home consoles, there are still a number notable of games that pass the system by, whether it be due to technological limitations or a market reasons. Bethesda, as an example, has shown a willingness to try and make it work with titles like Doom Eternal and Wolfenstein, but has also said that there are limits to what can be done on the system in the case of games like Fallout 76.

Later, Furukawa points out that the currently Japan-exclusive cloud service to stream third party games is another option. That service has been used for Resident Evil VII and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey so far in a similar method to, as examples, Google’s Project Stream and PlayStation Now, but physical distance from the servers makes the titles unplayable outside of Japan. It is unknown if Nintendo plans to ever bring that method, and thus the necessary servers, westward.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network. -- http://www.bleacherreview.com/2018/11/microsoft-reports-record-q1-results-as.html",,bleacherreview,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

I dont get this post at all. The Wii wasn't a piece of shit and developed plenty of worthwhile and amazing games. A bunch are getting ported to switch now, but that's for the best honestly. If it wasn't for the Wii u the switch wouldn't be here and Nintendo needed a lesson anyway. There is pros and cons to both the switch and vita. If you want new games going forward, of course you need the switch as it is the last current and foreseeable bastion of portable dedicated gaming. Sure its a hybrid, but it's portable enough, not near as portable as a vita of course, but enough. I'm a vita die hard through and through, and the os vita backlog isn't going anywhere so its not like you won't get great use out of the system. But being a Nintendo fan as you were, writing off the switch was and is insane. Third party support is actually solid and hasn't been this good in awhile. Least Nintendo third party support standards. The vita isn't for the players and neither has playstation since ps3. They are a business and it shows in their inane decisions over the years. Terrible security on PSN. Expensive hardware for ps3 (warranted in my opinion given my love for backwards compatibility), then slowly removing core features of that console with not direct replacement for it (bc, Linux, USB ports, etc). Ps4 being just so fucking boring and predictable. Not offering anything on ps1/2/3 bc on ps4 beside that overpriced nonsense psnow. Not supporting or even caring about the vita past its first year and a half of life, alienating customers along with it. And lastly, currently their atrocious changes to censoring on their video game platform. It's ridiculous. They are not for the players, they are for the money. The vita didn't make them any so they packed up and left without trying. It wasn't and isn't a main pillar like the ps3 was, so it was easily pushed under the rug.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

They also make more revenue because it's more expensive. Why people choose to pay for it, I don't know, but I also don't understand why people ride the Sony jock so hard - and I am saying that as someone who owns a PS4 (and a PS3 for that matter). Game Pass is doing okay right now but it is MOSTLY limited to the XB1, and like you said, its sales are much lower than the PS4. But Game Pass is coming to PC soon, most likely early next year, and the combination of that + integration of the Xbox and Windows 10 platforms is going to bode very well for Microsoft, I think. When I said ""Sony shit the bed"", I meant in terms of trajectory. PSNow will continue to draw in revenue, but I think Game Pass is making all the right moves. Like I said - Microsoft is poising themselves to be the Netflix for games and they're doing everything right so far but they're not there *yet*. > Now for the disclaimers: I don’t care about the console war, I go to where the games I want to play are. I’ve owned almost every consoles released, although I currently don’t have an XBox due to a lack of exclusives that interest me. I will probably get one in a year or so, but not in a rush. (Announce a new Crimson Skies and I buy.) I totally understand you there - and I think this is the important thing to consider. Microsoft owns some good properties. They have made some really great exclusive games, but they don't get as much attention as Sony because a) there is a smaller base on the XB1, b) they're also available on PC and c) Sony fanboys shit all over everything they possibly can, and have been doing that since the late 1990s. I think Microsoft knows they need the first party offerings to drive people to Game Pass. I think the success of Forza Horizon 4 will only amplify that. They have been buying up studios left and right, and they wouldn't be doing that unless they planned on having them make games - because it only takes that ONE really choice game to get somebody interested in the service and get them hooked. For you, it's Crimson Skies - for many it was Forza Horizon 4 - for some it might be a new Perfect Dark game. Who knows what they have planned. I'm honestly REALLY excited to see what Microsoft is going to do next, and honestly buying up a company like Obsidian is really promising and not something I expected to happen. I feel like Microsoft is trying to harken back to original Xbox days or something - because the connection there for me is KOTOR II, largely considered to be superior to the first game, both of which were big hype machines for the original XBOX. I still remember reading about ""Star Wars RPG"" in magazines and chubbing up I was so excited. Obviously that doesn't mean KOTOR III is going to happen or something ridiculous like that but the point is they have a good history and I hope it leads to a good future.",,caninehere,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Because the next system will be their first successive system that isn’t a complete departure from previous architecture hardware. And I don’t see them ever going back down that road again. Meaning, the next system will be the exact same basic architecture as the ps4 pro...just more powerful. Meaning...the next new PlayStation will be fully backwards compatable to the ps4 (and play games from all previous PlayStations) Therefore, there is no reasonable need to differentiate their systems with numbers any more. PlayStation going forward needs to inform consumers that PlayStation systems from now on will be all encompassing, a pervasive ecosystem, not a complete cutoff from previous gens like before. They need to position the PlayStation system as a new brand of gaming system going forward. The future is that every new PlayStation system you buy, it plays all past PlayStation games as well. Either through disc access, or PsNow downloads/streaming. I have a hunch they want to try and differentiate the “ps5” from the ps4 pro. Naming it something else besides a iteration number will get people’s attention about what PlayStation systems will be now. There is no reason to NOT drop the numeral iteration on their home console at this point. They don’t need the 5 for some kind of brand recognition or market awareness.

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== I hope these idiots in my city don't see this as they will surely try to copy them.",,Yogizorch,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,GOV/MIL Tax games: Chicago PlayStation users furious at new city fee,,,

The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Quote: : A near 10% tax is $1 for every $10 spent on game rentals relating to that post.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

Meaning...the next new PlayStation will be fully backwards compatable to the ps4 (and play games from all previous PlayStations) Therefore, there is no reasonable need to differentiate their systems with numbers any more. PlayStation going forward needs to inform consumers that PlayStation systems from now on will be all encompassing, a pervasive ecosystem, not a complete cutoff from previous gens like before. They need to position the PlayStation system as a new brand of gaming system going forward. The future is that every new PlayStation system you buy, it plays all past PlayStation games as well. Either through disc access, or PsNow downloads/streaming. I have a hunch they want to try and differentiate the “ps5” from the ps4 pro. Naming it something else besides a iteration number will get people’s attention about what PlayStation systems will be now. There is no reason to NOT drop the numeral iteration on their home console at this point. They don’t need the 5 for some kind of brand recognition or market awareness.

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== Good! Stupid should hurt! Those Chicago idiots are the ones who keep voting in the corrupt tax and spend democraps that continue to run this state into the ground.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== A near 10% tax is $1 for every $10 spent on game rentals relating to that post. That's pretty significant. Chicago must be hurting for more money as with many cities that overspend. If it's successful, I can imagine more cities following their example.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== Well now, isn’t that just spiffy!

After going back and forth, I was finally able to convince Steam support that the Steam Link was the issue and not my PC, not my controller, not the SCP Drivers, etc. Since the ds3 controller is not officially supported by the Steam Link, they're pretty much unwilling to look into any problems that come with it. I guess it's a miracle that ds3 controllers even work as well as they do in the first place. Before we gave up, we did take a look at what the Steam Link thought my controller was. It was showing up as a genuine controller, so despite the fact that the symptoms are the same as SCPToolkit, the fix is not as simple as forcing Steam Link to recognize the controller as genuine because it is already doing that. One final recommendation from Steam support's side was to install Playstation Now on the PC since it supposedly includes its own drivers. I'm not entirely certain what this is supposed to accomplish. I wasn't able to get this to work either since psnow is buggier than the old world opponent network, but maybe somebody else will have better luck.",,teh chocolate hoarder,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,PS3 dualshock 3 controller random input / movement,,,

Anyone now in their twenties can recall being impressed by the awesome advancements in playability and graphic display of the Nintendo 64 and Sega’s Dreamcast system, and even more recently (only five or so years ago) the advent of Microsoft’s Xbox, Nintendo’s Game Cube, and the Play Station by Sony. The Video Gaming industry has made great strides in the past twenty years: from slow-moving, barely recognizable forms on screen in original Atari games such as Pac-Man, Calga, and Tron, to the extremely vivid and life-like graphics of Tomb Raider, Splinter Cell, and Tekken; available for the Xbox and Play Station. Now, just in time for Christmas 2005, Microsoft has made the next move in the continuing race for Video Gaming Supremacy with the introduction of the Xbox 360. The result is truly phenomenal.

The Xbox 360, as with all video game consoles, is basically just a computer with hardware and software dedicated to the function of running video games. The original Xbox was pretty much just a Microsoft PC with a modified Pentium III processor, some powerful graphics and audio capabilities, and a modified version of the Windows 2000 operating system, all packaged in that distinctive black box. 

This year Microsoft has released two versions of the Xbox 360: the Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Core System. The Xbox 360Core System is “plug and play”, that is, that in addition to the console, it includes an integrated controller and an AV cable. The Xbox 360 (not the “Core system”) comes with a wireless controller, an HD AV cable, an Ethernet connectivity cable, a headset, a media remote, and a removable 20-GB hard drive.

For anyone who thought the original Xbox was a technological marvel, you must try this out! As amazing and realistic as the play on the first Xbox was, the Xbox 360 makes its predecessor look tired and worn-out. Microsoft has rebuilt the Xbox from the ground up. From the name to the look, from hardware to features, the Xbox 360 is a radically different and more powerful machine than the original Xbox. Far more than a video game console, the Xbox 360 is a total media center that allows users to play games, network with other 360 owners; rip, stream and download all types of media, including high-definition movies, music, digital pictures and game content, as well as play DVD movies and audio CD’s. 

The Xbox 360 will revolutionize the gaming world. Microsoft has definitely set the new standard in video game technology.",,rafaeldhnl554,Bangladesh,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Xbox 360: A Revolution in Console Gaming,Post,,

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

179784508434,11/5/2018,http://bleacherreview.tumblr.com/post/179784508434,"By Anthony Watt /             Nov 4, 2018 3:32 PM




 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

Does it only pertain to downloadable games? PS4 to PS5? PSNow? Still nothing set in stone, so all we're left with is speculation. PS4 still has a tendency to sell at $299, however, this is the time of the year where you can get one on the cheap with a game or two. I doubt it will remain at $299 after the holidays. There were still rumors of Sony working on a PS4 ""slimmer"" much like what we saw with the PS2, so don't be too surprised if you see a smaller and cheaper PS4 down the line.

After you play the game for a while, some or all zombies will turn into these headless bandits or just lose their heads in general, making them unkillable and the game basically unplayable (and potentially corrupting your save file). The only way to ""fix"" the issue is to kill Marston, and even then it'll just pop up again after 15-30 minutes or so. It's a good thing for Rockstar this only started happening after everyone had already moved on to GTA V, and people only started noticing the glitches when RDR was made playable on the Xbone and on PSNow streaming. Did they fix anything? gently caress no. Did any news outlet report the game was broken? gently caress no. Is Rockstar still happy to sell you the Undead Nightmare DLC while knowing it's broken?

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Quote: : I love living in the greediest city in the US Good old Crook County.",,shrex,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Chicago introduces 9% ""Cloud Tax"" for PlayStation Plus/Now Users",,,

From a rough estimate from MC or GS it seems it appears to be far lower, especially for XB, but give us some accurate data on your claim. I can tell you which system has the biggest 8.0+ total library though, it's PC with over 100 games. Sorry, I should have specified. When I said console exclusivity is at its highest I was talking in terms of quality. The games released on console this generation are just amazing, this generation of gaming is way better than the last gen which is where PC really started to become a competitor. Quantity wise then yeah PC wins by far. PC exclusives tend to be MMO's or indie games, and all of the decent ones are just ported over to console eventually like Stardew Valley. Still though, I do wish we had some PS4 exclusives on PC. Bloodborne runs like ass on PS4 even though it's an exclusive, I hardly hit 25 FPS at best. Hopefully consoles step up their game next gen. And TBS, RTS, SIM. Not all the decent ones are ported, which is why PC has the most 8+ games by over 100 games. Bloodborne is on PC via PSNOW. Nearly all XB1X games are on PC.

I’m interested Click to expand... But what are the reasons they wouldn't call it PS5? Click to expand... Because the next system will be their first successive system that isn’t a complete departure from previous architecture hardware. And I don’t see them ever going back down that road again. Meaning, the next system will be the exact same basic architecture as the ps4 pro...just more powerful. Meaning...the next new PlayStation will be fully backwards compatable to the ps4 (and play games from all previous PlayStations) Therefore, there is no reasonable need to differentiate their systems with numbers any more. PlayStation going forward needs to inform consumers that PlayStation systems from now on will be all encompassing, a pervasive ecosystem, not a complete cutoff from previous gens like before. They need to position the PlayStation system as a new brand of gaming system going forward. The future is that every new PlayStation system you buy, it plays all past PlayStation games as well. Either through disc access, or PsNow downloads/streaming. I have a hunch they want to try and differentiate the “ps5” from the ps4 pro. Naming it something else besides a iteration number will get people’s attention about what PlayStation systems will be now. There is no reason to NOT drop the numeral iteration on their home console at this point. They don’t need the 5 for some kind of brand recognition or market awareness. I don’t think anyone feels the Vita bombed because it wasn’t called the psp2? Click to expand... You did not provide any good reasons why it won't be called PS5. You are getting lost in the weeds instead of thinking of the general branding for the mass market and what has worked perfectly so far. It will be a new generation and a break from the PS4, hence the PS5 moniker. They won't call it something else because of BC lol.",,the_wire30,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

After going back and forth, I was finally able to convince Steam support that the Steam Link was the issue and not my PC, not my controller, not the SCP Drivers, etc. Since the ds3 controller is not officially supported by the Steam Link, they're pretty much unwilling to look into any problems that come with it. I guess it's a miracle that ds3 controllers even work as well as they do in the first place. Before we gave up, we did take a look at what the Steam Link thought my controller was. It was showing up as a genuine controller, so despite the fact that the symptoms are the same as SCPToolkit, the fix is not as simple as forcing Steam Link to recognize the controller as genuine because it is already doing that. One final recommendation from Steam support's side was to install Playstation Now on the PC since it supposedly includes its own drivers. I'm not entirely certain what this is supposed to accomplish.

The only way I can see them doing this is by purchasing existing services like they did with Gaikai or partnering with someone like IBM, who already has a comparable cloud infrastructure setup. I have taken PSNow into consideration. I've also considered it a non factor because of it's colossal failure.

Hopefully their reply to PS5 will come out strong with these new exclusives but for now bleh. * I actually enjoyed microsoft's conference this year and all the games ill get to enjoy on my PS4 later but having your only marketable exclusives being another gears and another halo.. again... just doesnt sell on a console.

But games games and more games is soney's drive and my preferred way of them working. it doesn't matter how many cool features or amazing graphics a system can push if there Arent any killer apps. * obviously cross play was a big issue here that they held off on for a while now and whether they did it because they saw the error of their ways or because they would lose money(probably that one) they've already back peddaled on that same as xbox. I don't see how that's a point for your argument when xbox has done nothing for the last 5 years but back pedal on their original decision and you want us to give them a chance. * this point is the most confusing of all. honestly how can you have ""sat on the same exclusives they've been talking about for years"" yet lift Microsoft on a pedestal for just now after this many years acquiring new studios. halo, gears, and forza are the only big names anyone talks about from xbox other than maybe cuphead, PUBG(man did fortnite steal their lunch money) and crackdown 3 that still isnt fucking out yet. yet at least from where I'm standing Playstation seams to release new exclusives every month. * you basicly just said the same point twice ""not gamer friendly"" so ill just restate that its weird to point and say ""see see they did something bad"" even though they've taken it back yet you expect us to give microsoft the benefit of the doubt because of the steps they've taken after their ""not gamer friendly"" xbox always on thing. * people lost their mind when nintendo said they wouldnt be at e3, but now id argue nintendo directs are a better way of release information than the conference ever was. It's pretty bold to say playstations skipping e3 because they're ""too successful for it"" (not sure where your quote came from) but since we have no other information well just have to wait and see. xbox one is a physically better console not objectivly. xbox onex specificly has stronger specs than its ps4 counterpart but a measure of a console is first and formost the quality of the games it has. In this matter xbox has dropped the ball but can potentally get better in a few years. that being said saying ""soney is in deep,deep trouble"" is just wishfull thinking on your part. Once again we don't know what sony has planed for games or console releases in the future. A decade from now we may look back and wonder how archaic it was to wait until e3 for our big annoncments. we just dont know but jabbing how obliterated the ps3 was while defending the xbox one is silly. in conclusion im actually excited to see what microsoft has in its future, but IMO they still have some catching up to do from sony about what really makes a great console.",,SirDolphinian,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

My personal recommendation is to try Trails of Cold Steel, they are not for everyone as the series is very slow paced but for me it has become my favorite game series since I found it on PSNow two years ago. Having now played through the older Trails in the Sky games and buying and replaying Cold Steel on PC.

Don't let it frustrate you too much, but don't slam your head in to the wall for the sake of it, take a break if needs be Vials were never a problem for me past the first area. I would just make a habit every time i went to level up before i did something dangerous to spend all the 'left over' currency on buying blood vials, no matter if i needed them or not. it adds up very nicely sitting in the bank until i die and need them. once you get multiple levels and xp costs are very high you will have even more to spend on vials. ====================::==================== Quote: : » Hello, thread. So as a Souls fan without a PS4, I kind of resigned myself to never playing Bloodborne. But then PSNow comes along and it actually works pretty well so I've been able to play it! I've been reading some spoiler things so I would know how to get to Cainhurst and such but mostly avoiding this thread, but I have a story I feel I need to share. ]One of the things I read about was how to be friends with Djura, which I wanted to do. So I fight Darkbeast Paarl and I had a lot of trouble with him, he keeps jumping around makes it hard and my main weapon is the Tontius which isn't effective against him, so I have to use an alternate. I spend probably 40 or so Blood vials to kill him, trying a couple different times until I level up, but I finally do it. So then I go through the back door, run around Old Yharnam getting chased by beasts to get to Djura. But I accidently miss going up his ladder and walk in front him so he starts shooting at me, and he accidentally hurt one of the beasts. Oh well, I find the ladder and go up thinking maybe we can still be friends, but he just shoots me with his shotgun and i let him kill me hoping I can try again and befriend him. So I go the same way, run from the beasts again and go up the ladder without getting shot at. I get to the top hoping he'll be friendly but instead of Djura I just see an item. I pick it up and it's the Poder Keg Hunters badge. He must have accidently jumped off the tower after killing me! I just wanted to be your friend Djura! Overall I'm really enjoying the game. As a souls fan who also likes Gothic and Cosmic Horror the game was pretty much made for me. PSNow has also worked surprisingly well, I have died due to lag sometimes but it is impressive that it can handle this. Dang. That's exactly how I killed him, except when I did it I meant for him to die.",,LD50,United States of America,,,Positive,Sadness,Forums,,,,,"[Bloodborne] ""Behold! A Paleblood sky!"" 67",,,

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the city’s amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the city’s favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the city’s Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

PlayStation Skipping E3 For First Time in Show’s 24-Year History https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/playstation-skips-e3-1203029833/ Je l'ai retrouvé sur Resetera : Sony Interactive Entertainment, currently riding high on record sales of its PlayStation 4 gaming console won’t be hosting its annual press conference or showing up at all during next year’s massive E3 expo. The news was buried inside the Entertainment Software Association’s announcement of the 2019 show. This will be the first time in E3’s 24-year history that PlayStation will not be attending the event, it is also the second major PlayStation event canceled by the company in recent months. In September, Shawn Layden, chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, said the company wouldn’t be hosting this year’s PlayStation Experience citing a lack of games to show. “Now that we have ‘Spiderman’ out the door, we’re looking down in 2019 to games like ‘Dreams’ and ‘Days Gone’ but we wouldn’t have enough to bring people altogether in some location in North America to have that event,” Layden said.”We don’t want to set expectations really high and then not deliver on it.” PlayStation Experience started four years ago as a celebration for PlayStation’s 20th anniversary as a way to “bring fans together” for a consumer event, according to Layden. The event expanded over the next few years as a place to give news updates. This year, though Layden expressed that “we have a lot of progress that we’re making in our games” but also that there’s not much to share at this point for upcoming titles. The same could be true for E3 2019, though that does raise concerns about the PlayStation 4 itself and a potential lack of upcoming titles. The timing also comes just a month after Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida confirmed that a successor to the PlayStation 3 is going to happen. “At this point, what I can say is it’s necessary to have a [sic] next-generation hardware,” Yoshida stated. Yoshida declined to confirm whether or not the next PlayStation console will be called the “PlayStation 5,” which seems like the natural choice. ====================::==================== jenicris c'est vite dit que la PS5 sera retro on a absolument aucunes infos de ce côté pour le moment la ""Retro"" ça peut très bien être un abonnement PSNow car on immagine bien que Gamepass / PSNow sont des services clés des prochaines gen",,diablo,France,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Aucune conférence Playstation à l'E3 2019.,,,

179774296563,11/4/2018,http://afp96491-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/179774296563,"San Francisco (AFP) - Video games are following television and music into the cloud, with console-quality play on its way to being a streaming service as easy to access as Netflix or Spotify.

Computing power in data centers and devices from televisions to smartphones has surged and streaming technology has advanced, providing tools to break blockbuster titles from confines of consoles or personal computers.

During a recent Microsoft earnings call, chief executive Satya Nadella said a keenly anticipated “X Cloud” video game streaming service is in “early days” but he is excited by the prospect of giving players access console-quality titles on all kinds of internet-linked devices.

“Most critical is having a platform where gamers are already there,” Nadella said, noting booming revenue from its Xbox console unit.

“I am most excited about the core (Xbox) community and content we have; I think that is what even gives us permission to think about streaming.”

Video game titan Electronic Arts (EA) this week laid out a vision of streaming video games enhanced with artificial intelligence to create “living, breathing worlds that constantly evolve.”

EA, maker of the popular Battlefield and FIFA game franchises, has more than 1,000 employees working on a platform to harness the power of cloud computing and artificial intelligence in a game service hosted on the California-based company’s servers, according to chief technology officer Ken Moss.

The effort is called “Project Atlas.”

“I strongly believe that what’s on the horizon will bring greater changes than anything gaming has ever seen,” Moss said in a blog post disclosing Atlas.

“You will be able to play games with your friends anytime, anywhere and on any device.”

- ‘Assassin’s Creed’ in the cloud -

Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter saw Amazon, Apple and Google as potential big players in the space given huge investments they have made in data centers that already provide cloud services to millions of people.

Amazon, a major cloud operator through its Amazon Web Services, also owns popular game play-streaming service Twitch.

Google is collaborating with French video game colossus Ubisoft to use the latest addition to the hit “Assassin’s Creed” franchise to test “Project Stream” technology for hosting the kind of quick, seamless play powered by in-home consoles as an online service.

“We’re going to push the limits with one of the most demanding applications for streaming – a blockbuster video game,” Google product manager Catherine Hsiao said in a blog post.

A select number of people in the US can play “Assassin’s Creed Odyssey” streamed to Chrome browsers on desktop or laptop computers.

Console quality video game play streamed online as a service, hosted on servers in the internet cloud, faces challenges including moving data quickly enough to avoid lags in action or imagery.

Improvements in internet bandwidth, computing power and data storage capabilities are enabling “disruptive technologies” such as streaming that can change the way games are created as well as played, according to Ubisoft.

- Consoles in crosshairs? -

Companies interested in cloud gaming see it as a way to reach broader audiences.

Microsoft has built a powerful platform for hosting computing in the internet cloud, making such service a thriving part of its business.

The Redmond, Washington-based technology veteran has also invested heavily in machine learning.

“If you agree that the eventual future of games consumption is through cloud gaming services, then those companies with a strong position in cloud are likely to be best placed to benefit from the transition,” said IHS Markit games technology research director Piers Harding-Rolls at an industry event earlier this year.

Sony offers more limited cloud service through its Playstation Now, keeping game play within the confines of the console.

While streaming game services might nibble at consoles sales, they are more likely to broaden the audience of players to anyone with an internet connection, according to analysts.

“I don’t think this means the death of the console,” Pachter said.

“Publishers need consoles the same way movie studios need theaters.”

A question unanswered what business model will prove optimal for game streaming services.

“It seems to me that the right business model is iTunes rather than Spotify,” Pachter said.

“Let people 'buy’ a game and stream it for as long as they want instead of forcing them to sign up for a subscription.”",,afp96491-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Video game action heads for the cloud,Post,,

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== To the liberal Chicongo city government?

Don't let it frustrate you too much, but don't slam your head in to the wall for the sake of it, take a break if needs be Vials were never a problem for me past the first area. I would just make a habit every time i went to level up before i did something dangerous to spend all the 'left over' currency on buying blood vials, no matter if i needed them or not. it adds up very nicely sitting in the bank until i die and need them. once you get multiple levels and xp costs are very high you will have even more to spend on vials. ====================::==================== Hello, thread. So as a Souls fan without a PS4, I kind of resigned myself to never playing Bloodborne. But then PSNow comes along and it actually works pretty well so I've been able to play it! I've been reading some spoiler things so I would know how to get to Cainhurst and such but mostly avoiding this thread, but I have a story I feel I need to share. ]One of the things I read about was how to be friends with Djura, which I wanted to do. So I fight Darkbeast Paarl and I had a lot of trouble with him, he keeps jumping around makes it hard and my main weapon is the Tontius which isn't effective against him, so I have to use an alternate. I spend probably 40 or so Blood vials to kill him, trying a couple different times until I level up, but I finally do it. So then I go through the back door, run around Old Yharnam getting chased by beasts to get to Djura. But I accidently miss going up his ladder and walk in front him so he starts shooting at me, and he accidentally hurt one of the beasts. Oh well, I find the ladder and go up thinking maybe we can still be friends, but he just shoots me with his shotgun and i let him kill me hoping I can try again and befriend him. So I go the same way, run from the beasts again and go up the ladder without getting shot at. I get to the top hoping he'll be friendly but instead of Djura I just see an item. I pick it up and it's the Poder Keg Hunters badge. He must have accidently jumped off the tower after killing me! I just wanted to be your friend Djura! Overall I'm really enjoying the game. As a souls fan who also likes Gothic and Cosmic Horror the game was pretty much made for me.

Don't have one, as I have ZERO interest in this system. OK, then we get into the ""I dunno for sure"" about these.

What's the skinny? Anyone have one? PS3 Cobra: See Below I know the Phoebe guy is working on one for the PCE CD, but I honestly don't know if he's ever going to finish it. Are there any for the Gamecube? I know there aren't any for the Sega CD yet (so, I think). I love these things, with a passion. So, any being worked on? Any exciting news? I was hoping someone would come up with one for the PS2. I run games off the HDD, but it's not 100 percent. I'd prefer something better. ====================::==================== HuDebug is supposed to be a PC Engine CD-ROM² ODE in a HuCard. It’s been demonstrated in a Turbo Express / PCE GT. Hopefully it will also support the Duo, Duo R, Duo RX, and Shuttle, since they can’t work with the SSDSys3 or UpperGrafx UGX-02. Speaking of the UpperGrafx / UperGrafx UGX-02, it doesn’t look like anyone has mentioned that yet. It’s like the PC Engine / TurboGrafx version of a Hi-Def NES crammed into an SSDSys3. The interface is a lot clunkier but it has improved by leaps and bounds over the last year. Heck, it didn’t even have a proper menu for picking your game before! ElectronAsh was almost finished designing his PCE/Turbo ODE but it seems that he placed it on hold after seeing that Terra Onion beat him to it. I’d love to see him finish it! It looked like he had the board designs and everything nearly ready to go. Duenan’s TG16/PCE ODE has been hinted at a couple times in his blog but there is no evidence that he’s still working on it. The first mention was basically just “Hey! I got a TG16. Maybe I’ll look into making an ODE for it.” and his next mention was basically just answering some off-topic comment on another news posting where someone asked how it was going. IIRC, it was a short and vague response like “Well.” Furrtek recently resumed working on an ODE for Neo Geo CD toploaders but it seems that even more recently he made a splash in the MiSTer community about doing an FPGA Neo. Since that interest is where all his Patreon money is coming from, he’s already switched gears. Hopefully he’ll get back to the NGCD ODE soon, since he demonstrated working prototypes. BadAssConsoles was selling a GC ODE that probably wasn’t much different from an adapted Wii ODE. I forget what it was called but it had “Mega” in the name. In the early 2000s the Warez release group Crazy Nation once had plans up on their website for making a GC ODE. IIRC, it had an IDE port.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

I can see why many think it is inevitable though, as it has taken over video and music. The Microsoft games streaming service is amazing. oh wait. How is it going to be noticeably better than Google's, psnow, and nvidia's? People don't notice lag on those services now unless they have flaky/bad internet? And my point was, you can set up a global streaming service (games, music, video, etc) and not have to own your own servers and compete just fine. edit: actually dude, you way too angry...ignore my reply. I'd rather have nothing than to have crap. Release it when it's ready. Project xCloud is Microsoft's claim that it's gonna be ready and it's not gonna be like PSNow is today. I didn't say Microsoft would be better than Google. Stop putting words in my mouth. I said they would be able to compete. Personally I'm not even familiar with NVidia's streaming service so...I simply would need more information. However I'm not claiming Microsoft would be better than them either. I never said Microsoft would even be the best. I do believe, however, that it will be better than what PSNow is today. That, I'm almost sure of. Why release Project xCloud if it's gonna be as bad as PSNow? It makes no sense to match Sony on that front. Plus Sony doesn't stream to any device, just Sony products and the PC from what I understand. So there's already evidence they are doing something more than what PSNow offers. You are saying you don't need the infrastructure to compete globally and that might be true...today. However, my point was that what happens when everybody else on the field has global servers and you don't? Why do you think they are doing this? For their health? No. Google and Microsoft are setting the stage for a next level battle.",,Jigsaah,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

179813002738,11/5/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/179813002738,"The music, TV, and film industries are already heavily involved with streaming, and while the video game industry is an increasingly digital business, streaming adoption remains limited. That could change in the future, as some higher-ups in gaming believe viable and widespread game-streaming technology is close(ish) to becoming a reality.

Sony already operates a game-streaming service in the form of PlayStation Now, while Microsoft is working on its own game-streaming service. Electronic Arts is creating a streaming platform of its own, while Japanese gaming giant Capcom and Ubisoft are streaming some of their biggest games on Nintendo Switch in Japan–and Capcom specifically is planning to do more in the future.
Fallout 76
This is all to say that streaming is poised to become a bigger piece of the pie in the years ahead. Bethesda, the publisher of huge franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Rage, and many others, is preparing itself for a future where streaming is even more popular than it is now.

“Absolutely it is [going to be viable],” Bethesda marketing boss Pete Hines told GameSpot recently.

Bethesda’s numerous studios are already looking into how they can get ready for an industry that places more of an emphasis on streaming. Without any pressing on my part, Hines referenced “next-gen consoles” as it relates to streaming, which is intriguing given that one of rumours circling now is that one of the new Xbox consoles Microsoft is working on will be a streaming box.

“It’s absolutely something all of our studios have been involved in and looked at and thought about as we talk about what we do going forward,” Hines said. “Whether it’s where next-gen consoles are going, or what’s streaming is going to be like, or whatever. So yeah, it’s something that is on everybody’s radar and they think about as yet another platform essentially.”

Hines has already talked about how he knows “some stuff” about the next wave of new consoles, so his comments are all the more alluring with that context.

Streaming content like movies, music, and TV shows is considered generally easier from a technical standpoint because they are less involved in comparison to video games that have numerous different processes and under-the-hood wizardy happening. There is also the matter of input lag. It’s exciting to think about being able to stream a game like Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey in your browser, but any amount of significant input lag might turn people away. What’s more, streaming any kind of media requires a capable and consistent internet connection, which could pose problems for people in some parts of the world.
Rage 2
Services like PlayStation Now and Google’s Project Stream are already demonstrating that streaming is an exciting and viable proposition, but it is still early days. Physical media is not going away anytime soon, nor is playing games on local hardware. The second of Microsoft’s rumoured new Xbox consoles is a more traditional system that plays games locally, according to a report from Brad Sams, with the streaming box offered merely as an option for those who want it.

Hines’ new comments about streaming come after he talked about how he would like the industry to get to a place where you can buy a game and play it wherever you want. Andrew Wilson, the CEO of EA, said during a presentation recently that he sees a future where you can play games on any device you want, with streaming/cloud gaming help accelerate that shift. Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Rockstar Games parent company Take-Two Interactive, has said he believes streaming will help accelerate the industry’s transition away from “closed” systems.

Presumably companies like Bethesda, EA, Take-Two, and others are briefed on announcements before they are made public, so it’s intriguing to hear top executives at each company independently say much the same thing about where the industry and new consoles may be headed.

Video game streaming hasn’t been a total success story so far, as you may recall the OnLive service shut down before it ever got much of a foothold.

Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America.

180124246226,11/14/2018,http://nikhilshakya5.tumblr.com/post/180124246226,"Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft’s Xbox One subscription service that lets you play more than 100 games for a monthly fee, is doing really well, it seems. Xbox boss Phil Spencer told LevelUp that the program already has “millions” of subscribers following its public release in June 2017.

“We are seeing incredible growth with Xbox Game Pass. We have millions of subscribers of Game Pass today,” Spencer said in the interview.

Xbox Game Pass has been referred to as the “Netflix of Games,” but that’s exactly the best description. Netflix is a streaming service, while Xbox Game Pass titles require a download. In that way, Xbox Game Pass is more similar in structure and setup to EA Access, the subscription service from EA that gives people access to a “Vault” of games as part of a monthly or yearly subscription fee. Sony has its PlayStation Now service, which allows players to stream a catalog of games for a monthly fee; the option to download was recently added.

Microsoft is working on a game-streaming service currently called Project xCloud, while EA is also working on a streaming service of its own. Microsoft (and EA for its part) have not yet announced the specifics of its streaming service, so we don’t yet what a subscription price or game availability may be at this stage.

Whatever the case, Spencer said Xbox Game Pass is merely an option for players who want it. Buying games individually is a perfectly fine way to play, and he mentioned that individual game sales are doing well for Xbox right now. Xbox Game Pass costs $10/month (though there is a $1 introductory offer going on now), and as long as your subscription is active you can download and play any of the more than 100 titles available in the catalog. The library includes Xbox One games like Sea of Thieves, Halo 5, and Forza Horizon 4, as well as numerous third-party games like Rocket League and backwards-compatible Xbox 360 games. In fact, all upcoming Microsoft games will launch in the Xbox Game Pass library, which means next year’s Gears 5 and the upcoming Halo Infinite will be free for subscribers.

Earlier this year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella teased that Xbox Game Pass could come to PC sometime down the road, and that’s an exciting prospect to think about. For Spencer, he said Xbox Game Pass is great because it helps introduces players to games and different genres they might not have otherwise engaged with.

“People in Game Pass are playing more games than they did before they were a Game Pass subscriber,” Spencer said. “Maybe you say, ‘Duh, they have all these games, [so] they’re going to play more games.’ But they are playing genres of games that they didn’t play before because it’s easy to try them out. When one genre, or one type of game, becomes what everybody is doing, that’s not the most healthy thing for creativity.”

Also in the interview, Spencer said some of the games in the Xbox Game Pass library are seeing a “huge uplift” in player figures.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

It makes sense that its revenue would be much higher than the others when they're charging, as an example, double per month what Xbox Game Pass is charging. I'd be more interested in seeing subscriber numbers. I suspect EA/Origin Access will have all the others beat, considering it's only $5 a month. Yes it is based on revenue, but even if you tripled the percentage for Game Pass PSNow would still have more. If you added up all of EA's offerings (they are listed as three separate ones on the chart) they would make up 33 percentage points, which is nothing to shake a stick at considering EA is an individual publisher.

If you preorder on xbox and I'm guessing playstation, now you can download the game before it's even released. This is especially helpful when you download a digital copy and not off the physical copy. I have a friend who preordered fallout 76 and got the physical disk 2 days before its release. I think if you're planning on buying the game in a digital form or you want bonus content, preordering is the way to go since you can download it beforehand. If you just want the physical disk, games tend to download quickly this way so it's not really worth preordering.",,GloriousHecks,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Quote: : Blue State problems.

Now if you want to know the real problem that occurred it's simple, Crackdown 3 went through development hell. Microsoft when under it's new president made a huge push for cloud based services to replace Microsoft's ailing software and phone divisions. Xbox One was aimed to be the smart home box with cloud computing that would render it the most superior machine as they'd simply only ever have to increase the power of their servers in order to boost their performance. Crackdown 3 was going to be their showcase title that would demonstrate to everyone the superiority of the concept. On paper it was a fantastic idea, in practice a disaster. I'm not even talking about the blowback from the Xbox One's announcement. No where in the world outside small little pockets did the infrastructure even exist to support their model. Data plans also would render the technology not viable in most of Europe. Worse the technology has massive latency issues which Sony continues to have with playstation now. (Game pass is vastly superior to Now and Sony is beginning to copy it). All of a sudden Microsoft found out that they wouldn't be able to use cloud based computing for Crackdown 3. From leaks that came out development was a disaster from that point on. The issue is simply their designers couldn't get the engine to render the destruction without the excess power the cloud computers provided as that is how the engine was designed. In short MS would need to scrap every bit of progress and rebuild Crackdown 3 from the ground up to get it to work as it was originally announced. That would be very costly endeavor requiring the hiring of some of be best engine designers in the industry and like 2-3 years of development before they could even begin development on Crackdown 3. The decision then came down that single player would ax the destruction and only online would have the cloud based computing. This was more a political move as Microsoft could not announce they were scrapping the vast majority of the destruction as even Electronic Arts has managed it at some point. At no point has Microsoft: > either MS or Xbox of fraud basically. They've been rather open about the whole issue though more specifics came out from leaks here and there. Microsoft has many issues with their hiring practices, management, design departments, corporate structure, but the one thing they don't do is fraud. Maybe if you weren't fanboying so hard you could have actually read my post correctly. ​",,Nevek_Green,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Hopefully this BS never comes to NY.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Blue State problems.",,jsteinhauer,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Chicago introduces 9% ""Cloud Tax"" for PlayStation Plus/Now Users",,,

More at: https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-...-amusement-tax ====================::==================== Money Printing is Counterfeiting Yes, this does relate to "" Amusement Tax "". First, we need to understand how our money works, as simply as it can be put: Monetary Policy - ""Print"" The Money (via Loans) Fiscal Policy - ""Destroy"" the Money (via Taxation) All money printed must be destroyed. Every dollar in your pocket and bank acct represents someones debt to someone else. Welfare is no different, but instead of that Debt representing one person, it represents everyone who uses the US Dollar by using Inflation as an Invisible Tax on the Value of that dollar. This ""Amusement Tax"" falls under the category of Fiscal Policy. It destroys the money, just as paying off a loan returns that money to the state it existed in initially, which was nothing. But back up two seconds, remember that Banks do NOT loan money they have, they create it out of thin air with the Magic of Fractional Reserve Lending. This is LEGAL COUNTERFEITING. What makes that Legal is the fact that the Repayment of that Loan does not allow that money to remain in existence. There are two ways to ""Destroy Money"". Pay off a loan, and Taxes. Your Federal Income Tax payments made out to the IRS are used to pay the INTEREST that the US owes to the Federal Reserve Bank for use of its money. Thus, paying Taxes, indirectly, is a Loan Payment, and that money is subsequently also destroyed. The idea of an ""Amusement Tax"" is made by rulers who are issuing Behavior Modification by issuance of Fines and Levies. They think that an Amusement Tax will generate revenue. They are partly right, and partly wrong. What they are really doing is merely applying the Belief, Money, Violence paradigm. If you ""Believe"" their words, then Amusement is a Behavioral Sin, which is sufficient grounds to punish people for partaking, thus, applying Money. Im quite sure if you avoid paying your Amusement Tax, they will apply Violence, by way of Imprisonment, thus completing the paradigm. Sadly, it falls perfectly into the Mental Trap that Taxation provides rewards of ""improved"" behaviors and receiving something of commensurate value in exchange. This is nothing more than an indication that the Govt spends far more than it takes in. The Payouts can also come from Welfare. Give out too much in Welfare, and create new taxes to prevent the Money Supply from Hyperinflating. The Life Cycle of the US Dollar as a Fiat Currency, and the World Reserve Fiat Currency is coming to an end. I would expect to see one of two things as a consequence: Increases in both Welfare and Taxation Introduction of New Forms of Taxation The system is unbalanced and will remain unbalanced because those with the power to print the money have the power to print something else without consequence: Interest. Interest is inherently as dishonest as Counterfeiting because our money is Backed By Debt, so if you can ""just print interest"" then you can ""just print debt"" and ""debt = money"". Those with the power to Print Money, the Banks, will end up with Everything and you will end up with Nothing. The system will continue to function by bleeding out the value of the currency issued. Since you and I can not ""just print money / debt"", you and I are stuck holding the same quantity of money, which becomes more and more worthless. If this system could continue, in 100 years, the very idea of ""Dollar Menu"" or ""Dollar Store"" will adapt to reflect the value of the dollar, and we would end up with the ""100 Dollar Store"" or ""100 Dollar Menu"". Yes, the worst hamburgers imaginable would cost over a hundred bucks, in a hundred years, if this system did not collapse under its own weight. Ignorance of the nature of Coin and Credit has gotten us into this mess, and expect to see more new taxes like it as an effort to keep a failed concept going, transferring everything from the people to the Money Changers. Even your elected leaders barely understand this. Perhaps it is time for New Leaders? Since we know ""youre not voting hard enough"" never fixes the issue, perhaps that New Leader should be YOU?",,osan,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Chicago PlayStation Users Furious They Must Now Pay A 9% ""Amusement Tax""",,,

MS looking to improve the Windows store is competing more with Steam, Origins, Uplay than it is against Sony. MS going into the streaming end I think is competing with Sony, but is probably due more to Amazon and Google's interest in that field than Sony's presence there already. Gamepass was likely designed to compete with sub models like EA Access more so than PSNow. I think PSNOW has turned and began to compete against GP recently though as they've begun to allow downloads.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

I wouldn't put it that way. But I was expecting doomsday prophecies to come true by ""free market"" think tanks, but what I see are businesses returning to the U.S., more job openings than unemployed people, and people getting off their asses and going to work again instead of sitting at home on food stamps. One can argue that this would have happened with or without tariffs, but that's kind of like trying to prove a negative at this point. Thanks to China and Canada's trade war, we do have too much milk and soybeans now, which, I suppose means more flatulence. A tragedy no doubt.

179784093074,11/5/2018,http://bleacherreview.tumblr.com/post/179784093074,"By Anthony Watt /             Nov 4, 2018 3:32 PM




 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected.

Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said.

If not, will any micro USB cable work? Will it only charge the controller or will it actually run the controller as well? If it won't run the controller, is all I need just a cheap Bluetooth USB dongle(my mobo is old and doesn't support bluetooth)?

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable ====================::==================== Originally Posted by Millwright PlayStation 4 users in the Windy City now have to fork out a nine-percent tax for the privilege of gaming in their own homes, as Sony becomes the latest video gaming company to enforce the city’s much-loathed Amusement Tax.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Quote: : A near 10% tax is $1 for every $10 spent on game rentals relating to that post. That's pretty significant. Chicago must be hurting for more money as with many cities that overspend. If it's successful, I can imagine more cities following their example. Not cool.

They admit that your connection has a lot to do with the quality. I happen to have amazing internet. So yes, you're right, I can't speak for everyone.

I am hopeful however that if they are doing this right now at 10 mb/sec and I get 250mb/sec that this could be amazing for my specific situation. I think this is kinda beside the point though. Earlier in the thread, my argument was that Sony doesn't have anything right now to contend in this environment. They had cloud gaming, they were using Shinra. Then they shut it down in 2016. Why? Im not sure, but maybe it could be because they have a better solution. I mean PSNow is still available. It could also be because PSNow wasn't as popular as they would have liked.

According to a new report from industry research group Superdata, the leading subscription services combined to bring in about $273 million in revenue during the third quarter of the year. The group determined that most of that revenue (52%) was accounted for by Sony's PlayStation Now service, which it said brought in $143 million for the quarter. EA's collection of PC and console services--EA Access, Origin Access, and Origin Access Premier--combined to bring in about $90 million, with a little over half of that coming from EA Access and the Origin offerings splitting the remainder. Interestingly, the new Premier tier of Origin Access brought in slightly more than the basic Origin Access tier, even though it was only launched partway through the quarter. Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass brought up the rear among the major offerings with roughly $41 million in revenue, a little less than EA Access but more than either of the Origin programs. Although these services together combined for just 6% of overall non-free-to-play console and PC revenue for the quarter, Superdata noted that consumers of other media have already shown a pronounced shift toward getting their entertainment through subscriptions. It said that in the US, 74% of people who spend on digital video do it through services like Netflix and Hulu instead of purchasing the shows and movies they want a la carte. For music, 64% of digital customers have subscriptions for services like Spotify or Apple Music, compared to 51% who buy their music directly from storefronts like iTunes. Unlike those other forms of media, games also have the advantage of selling add-on content to users of subscription services, and Superdata found subscribers more willing to do so. On average, subscribers to game services spend $25 a month on in-game content, compared to $10 for non-subscribers. And even with the subscriptions, those users are spending $57 a month on full game purchases, compared to the non-subscriber average of $39. https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articl...quarter-report",,wraggster,United Kingdom,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,PlayStation Now brought in $143 million last quarter - Report,,,

179940848913,11/9/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/179940848913,"During Nintendo’s most recent financial report, the company’s relatively new president Shuntaro Furukawa took questions from investors on the company’s performance and future plans. One investor pointed out to Furukawa that there are many big games that are missing from the Switch; while he did not name any titles specifically, it is logical to assume he means games like Red Dead Redemption II, which sold 17 million copies in its first week. Furukawa’s answer was blunt: some things just won’t come to Switch and that’s an unrealistic expectation.

“We believe that giving consumers a wide selection of software is an extremely important part of operating our platforms,” Furukawa said in the English translation of the Q&A provided by Nintendo. ""That is why we welcome the introduction of a variety of titles from many different software publishers. Even so, I do not think it is realistic to expect that every major title will become available on Nintendo Switch. We are speaking with publishers about them actively putting titles on Nintendo Switch that would be an especially good fit for its unique features as a home console system you can carry around, including handheld mode and the ability to bring systems together for local multiplayer. Given the strong publisher support Nintendo Switch has, I would expect the number of titles on it will increase a lot more. That is what really keeps the Nintendo Switch business on the right track.“

While the Switch has indeed gotten better third party support than most Nintendo home consoles, there are still a number notable of games that pass the system by, whether it be due to technological limitations or a market reasons. Bethesda, as an example, has shown a willingness to try and make it work with titles like Doom Eternal and Wolfenstein, but has also said that there are limits to what can be done on the system in the case of games like Fallout 76.

Later, Furukawa points out that the currently Japan-exclusive cloud service to stream third party games is another option. That service has been used for Resident Evil VII and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey so far in a similar method to, as examples, Google’s Project Stream and PlayStation Now, but physical distance from the servers makes the titles unplayable outside of Japan. It is unknown if Nintendo plans to ever bring that method, and thus the necessary servers, westward.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Nintendo President Cautions That Not Every Major Title Will Hit Switch,Post,,

Starting November 14, residents should expect an increase on their PlayStation Store receipts, which include “PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Now, PlayStation Vue, PlayStation Music, PlayStation Video On Demand, and PlayStation Video Live Events.” The tax isn't popular in the city of Chicago, but Emanuel says the taxes are necessary to shore up the city's pensions.

Fact of the matter is, Microsoft, Google and potentially Amazon is changing the entire landscape of gaming. They aren't flipping the narrative or moving the goal posts like Sony. They are strapping a nuke to the field and hitting the giant red ""RESET"" button. There is a paradigm shift coming in gaming. Microsoft saw it early on and are touting numbers in terms of users for a reason. Those who think it's because their sales are lower than Sony's...that's a very small part of it. They are preparing themselves for the likes of Amazon and Google, who are much bigger threats than Sony, not in terms of sales or anything trivial like that. Google is trying to get to the aforementioned red ""RESET"" button first. All 3 of these companies are working on cloud services for their games. Sony is going to either have to align with one of them or get left in the dust. The best they have is Gaikai right now for PSNow. They are going to be 3 years late to the party for backwards compatibility. Them sticking to their guns while everybody else is evolving is not going to be a good thing for them. I'm sure they'll make their money, but when the Playstation is the only real thing they got going for them...it just doesn't seem smart to not keep up.

It is showing high revenue, and a reason others are jumping on the train. It's not, though. It's useful for one thing alone - seeing pure revenue. For anything else it's not useful. It's like comparing Lamborghini revenue to the revenue VW makes on Citi Golfs. For every 1 month sub Sony sells, EA has to sell 4 1 month subs. Is the conclusion here that you should just up your subscription cost to increase revenue? Not sure why this upsets you so much. I'm not insulting Sony or saying that PSNow is bad. I'm just pointing out that by virtue of having the more expensive service, the results are obviously going to be skewed in their favor.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Quote: : Glad I moved outta that cesspool of a city maybe the money is going towards the south side of the city",,Ant1010,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Chicago introduces 9% ""Cloud Tax"" for PlayStation Plus/Now Users",,,

That's my view too. I can see why many think it is inevitable though, as it has taken over video and music. Jigsaah said: Netflix and Youtube don't stream games and PSNow is crap. So either you beef up to compete with Microsoft, Amazon and Google or you get left in the dust. I'm not arguing that they need their own infrastructure. I'm arguing that if you want to compete in quality to what is being put on the table by other companies...you need your own infrastructure. Top 10 cloud services. Sony is no where to be seen. https://clutch.co/cloud The Microsoft games streaming service is amazing. oh wait. How is it going to be noticeably better than Google's, psnow, and nvidia's? People don't notice lag on those services now unless they have flaky/bad internet? And my point was, you can set up a global streaming service (games, music, video, etc) and not have to own your own servers and compete just fine. edit: actually dude, you way too angry...ignore my reply.

Now I own 3 PS4 consoles, a Wii, a switch and the other day I was looking for an Xbox. I want to change, I do. I've tried several times to get clean and purchase a gaming PC but, I just don't know how, I don't know what I NEED VS what I want and every time I ask for help I can't find anyone that speaks with words instead of numbers and letters. Then there is the cost, I understand that I have spent tons of money on a fix instead of addressing the problem like an adult, but this is where we are. My knolege of computers in general is I can turn one on and fix minor issues by turning off then back on. The fear of spending $800+ on something that might not even play the game I so desperately want to play is overwhelming and I just, well, I'm lost.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

Quote: : Sony issued a warning to users in Chicago (thanks, USGamer), signalling Chicago's Amusement Tax begins on 14th November, and so will collect nine per cent more from PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, among other PlayStation subscription services. The Amusement Tax does not apply to sales of video games. So, if you're in Chicago and buy a game from the PlayStation Store, you don't have to pay extra. Rather, it applies only to rentals (considered streaming or temporary downloads), where the charges are subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise, which is why Plus and Now are affected. ""The charges paid for such rentals may be subscription fees, per-event fees or otherwise,"" the law stipulates. Chicago's Amusement Tax, which was designed to apply to live events but has been successfully extended to online services, is the first of its kind in America. Sony has joined companies such as Netflix and Spotify in collecting the tax, but a number of businesses are challenging it on a legal basis. Apple, for example, has lodged a complaint against the city of Chicago over it. It's expected PC, Xbox and Nintendo customers will be similarly affected, pending any legal challenge. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2...Js-wavpRQm80Vc ====================::==================== Quote: : I love living in the greediest city in the US Good old Crook County.",,shrex,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"Chicago introduces 9% ""Cloud Tax"" for PlayStation Plus/Now Users",,,

179825233109,11/6/2018,http://timecapsulegame.tumblr.com/post/179825233109,"To summarize this post , the PS4 is an refurnished and upgraded version of its predecessor , the PS3. The PS4 has been designed internally and externally to suit the latest generation of gamers to its fullest potential.The upgraded AMD Accelerated Processing Unit gives a greater powering system and a stronger processor. Users of the PS4 are allowed to socially interact with other devices in a more advanced and easier way. The stronger processor also allows for the PS4 to run at a better speed and provides for a smooth , fun and enjoyable gaming experience. The upgrades to the PS4’s CPU and RAM makes it easier for architectures to develop the PS4, as it uses the 8-core AmD Jaguar CPU (max 2.7GHz ) with an 800MHz AMD Radeon GPU and 8GB of GDDR5 RAM. The PS4 cancels out the noise that the PS3 makes when running high-level games. The new DS4 is also designed to give users a better grip when using the controller. Even with the upgrades, the PS4 lacks upgrade in media skills. The PS3 gave more options for videos to be stored compared to the PS4 that can only stream files through the app “Plex”. Lastly, the PS4 has Playstation Now , an app allows cloud-based streaming service for backwards compability whereas the PS3 uses software emulation. As verdict , the PS4 has established itself as a console that will be around for years to come. With the quality of video games being released in the future , a PS3 will not be able to run the latest video games. Moving into 2019,  it is a great time to upgrade to the PS4 as the price has dropped since its release.",,timecapsulegame,Malaysia,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network. -- http://www.bleacherreview.com/2018/11/microsoft-reports-record-q1-results-as.html",,bleacherreview,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

A console that has no unique identity (no exclusives) has no purpose, as you can get another console that shares all the same games plus more for cheaper. If power really is your goal, a PC is always the smarter option and offers far more than the current Xbox model ever could. Hucast9 posted... Only a straight up liar would say that it's not worth it to buy a system that lets you play around 150 games for $1. Only a fanboy would use such a broad approach without thinking about the context. Judging by the OP, this is a gamer who has been relevant this gen meaning they've probably played most of those '150 games' you're boasting. Hell, I know I've played more than that this gen and I just looked at Gamepass and couldn't find more than 5 games I'd even bother with. How's a $500 machine with a subscription service that would satisfy me for a month worth it? Simple fact, it isn't, and for most it never will be. PSNow makes 3x what Gamepass does, offers 600+ games, is available on a cheaper console with more games and a unique identity... There's no intelligent gamer that will choose an X1 over a PS4. These are simple facts. If you're an Xbox fan that's great, but the facts don't lie and it's easily the worst offer to a consumer. SwoleSack posted... Absolutely not. The only reason ppl still play xbox is because their delusional and stuck in the past, these fanboys have schizophrenia. They cant let go of the trend of xbox being first last gen and fabricate lies like ""superior online"" when thats definetly not true. The competition fixed all their problems last gen and all these greenheads can do is say ""better pixel count"" now. As if xbox and xbox360 didnt have better multiplats last gen EVEN MORE SO than just a pix count but still lost.

Starting November 14, residents should expect an increase on their PlayStation Store receipts, which include “PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Now, PlayStation Vue, PlayStation Music, PlayStation Video On Demand, and PlayStation Video Live Events.” The tax isn't popular in the city of Chicago, but Emanuel says the taxes are necessary to shore up the city's pensions. Several companies like Apple and Netflix are taking action against the city for the taxes, but until any changes are made, PlayStation gamers are now subject to the same tax as other amusement activities. ====================::==================== *knock knock* Fun police!

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and responsiveness of the streaming. I live in a smaller city so there are no major server hubs nearby. Playing with an Xbox controller works fine, but doesn't work with games that require motion control or the touchpad. They'll be a stutter once in a while, but overall the picture is smooth and looks sharp. You can definitely tell the video stream is compressed especially with intense fast moving action, but it is not enough to be detrimental to play. I tested out the God of War 2 HD remake and it seemed to be streaming at the full 60 fps and the controls felt very responsive. Feels really strange playing a PS3 remake of a PS2 game on a PC with an Xbox controller. The application itself is very basic, but functional basically being a simple browser with giant game squares to scroll through. Saves and achievements are all handled cleanly through a minimal XMB UI If I do end up getting a PS4, the subscription does have a lot of value especially with the ability to download PS4 and PS2 games to play locally. I really hope they do another deal since I see that they had an offer a few months ago to pay $100 for a year. $19.99 per month is pushing it a little too high for me since I have plenty of other games around.",,PhantomLord,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

179812426926,11/5/2018,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/179812426926,"The music, TV, and film industries are already heavily involved with streaming, and while the video game industry is an increasingly digital business, streaming adoption remains limited. That could change in the future, as some higher-ups in gaming believe viable and widespread game-streaming technology is close(ish) to becoming a reality.

Sony already operates a game-streaming service in the form of PlayStation Now, while Microsoft is working on its own game-streaming service. Electronic Arts is creating a streaming platform of its own, while Japanese gaming giant Capcom and Ubisoft are streaming some of their biggest games on Nintendo Switch in Japan–and Capcom specifically is planning to do more in the future.
Fallout 76
This is all to say that streaming is poised to become a bigger piece of the pie in the years ahead. Bethesda, the publisher of huge franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Rage, and many others, is preparing itself for a future where streaming is even more popular than it is now.

“Absolutely it is [going to be viable],” Bethesda marketing boss Pete Hines told GameSpot recently.

Bethesda’s numerous studios are already looking into how they can get ready for an industry that places more of an emphasis on streaming. Without any pressing on my part, Hines referenced “next-gen consoles” as it relates to streaming, which is intriguing given that one of rumours circling now is that one of the new Xbox consoles Microsoft is working on will be a streaming box.

“It’s absolutely something all of our studios have been involved in and looked at and thought about as we talk about what we do going forward,” Hines said. “Whether it’s where next-gen consoles are going, or what’s streaming is going to be like, or whatever. So yeah, it’s something that is on everybody’s radar and they think about as yet another platform essentially.”

Hines has already talked about how he knows “some stuff” about the next wave of new consoles, so his comments are all the more alluring with that context.

Streaming content like movies, music, and TV shows is considered generally easier from a technical standpoint because they are less involved in comparison to video games that have numerous different processes and under-the-hood wizardy happening. There is also the matter of input lag. It’s exciting to think about being able to stream a game like Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey in your browser, but any amount of significant input lag might turn people away. What’s more, streaming any kind of media requires a capable and consistent internet connection, which could pose problems for people in some parts of the world.
Rage 2
Services like PlayStation Now and Google’s Project Stream are already demonstrating that streaming is an exciting and viable proposition, but it is still early days. Physical media is not going away anytime soon, nor is playing games on local hardware. The second of Microsoft’s rumoured new Xbox consoles is a more traditional system that plays games locally, according to a report from Brad Sams, with the streaming box offered merely as an option for those who want it.

Hines’ new comments about streaming come after he talked about how he would like the industry to get to a place where you can buy a game and play it wherever you want. Andrew Wilson, the CEO of EA, said during a presentation recently that he sees a future where you can play games on any device you want, with streaming/cloud gaming help accelerate that shift. Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Rockstar Games parent company Take-Two Interactive, has said he believes streaming will help accelerate the industry’s transition away from “closed” systems.

Presumably companies like Bethesda, EA, Take-Two, and others are briefed on announcements before they are made public, so it’s intriguing to hear top executives at each company independently say much the same thing about where the industry and new consoles may be headed.

Video game streaming hasn’t been a total success story so far, as you may recall the OnLive service shut down before it ever got much of a foothold.

The PSN Store isn't even in our local currency here in South America so I think there are a lot of things to tune up before bringing things like PSNow @ full force.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

 Microsoft posted the principal quarter of its 2019 financial outcomes today, revealing revenue of $29.1 billion and net income of $8.8 billion. Revenue is up 19 percent, and net income has increased by 34 percent. Microsoft says this is a record first quarter, thanks primarily to solid cloud development.

 Surface revenue has hopped 14 percent year over year this quarter to $1.1 billion. This is the primary quarter since Microsoft launched its Surface Go tablet in August, and it’s clear Surface is currently a strong billion dollar business. Microsoft has also managed to become a top five PC manufacturer in the US amid the ongoing quarter, thanks to Surface. On a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood revealed that Surface revenue this quarter has been driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go sales.

 Microsoft also divulged its new Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 laptops as of late, but these devices turned out poorly sale until the point when October so the revenue will be checked next quarter. In like manner, the new Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones won’t be available until one month from now so we’ll have to wait for Microsoft’s Q2 2019 financial outcomes to check whether these have an impact.

 Microsoft’s gaming business has been developing steadily as of late, and revenue is up 44 percent this quarter. Xbox hardware revenue has grown 94 percent this quarter, because of the planning of the Xbox One X launch. Xbox Live active users has also developed to 57 million in the ongoing quarter. In a call with financial specialists, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that “conveying [Xbox] Game Pass to the PC” is a major part of the company’s future for its Xbox services.

 Microsoft revealed as of late that it plans to start trials of its xCloud game streaming service in 2019. Microsoft’s cloud gaming will have solid rivalry from services like GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow, and Liquid Sky. Even Google is trying its own Project Stream service that will give gamers a chance to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through its Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop.

 While Surface has driven Microsoft into the top five PC makers in the US, the company also saw great outcomes for its Windows permitting revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue is up 8 percent this quarter, which means there was a higher blend of premium licenses being purchased by PC makers. Non-Pro revenue has decreased by 5 percent, as PC makers keep on marketing increasingly top of the line Windows laptops to buyers and commercial clients. Windows commercial items and cloud services revenue is also up 12 percent, because of an increase in multi-year agreements with organizations.

 Speaking of organizations, this is the place Microsoft is recording great development. Office commercial items and services revenue grew 17 precent this quarter, and Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36 percent. Organizations have been aggressively adopting Office 365 over the past year, and month to month active users has now surpassed 155 million. Even Office customer revenue has developed by 16 percent, and 32.5 million buyers presently buy in to Office 365.

 Over on the cloud and server side, Microsoft’s Azure revenue has grown 76 percent this quarter. Server items and cloud services in general has also developed by 28 percent. The whole “insightful cloud” division has now increased by 24 percent, marking $8.6 billion of Microsoft’s overall $29.1 billion revenue this quarter. More personal processing, that incorporates Windows, gaming, search, and Surface is the top division at $10.7 billion of overall revenue. Cloud, server, and Office joined makes up for $18.4 billion in revenue.

 Microsoft’s $26 billion wager on acquiring LinkedIn, the business-focused data and social networking company, is as yet looking encouraging. LinkedIn revenue grew 33 percent this quarter, thanks to an increase in sessions.

 Bing, and Microsoft’s search endeavors, is also contributing steadily to Microsoft’s overall revenue. Search advertising revenue increased 17 percent this quarter, and it has been increasing like this reliably over the past year. It appears to be related to higher revenue per search and an increase in search volume overall.

 Looking forward, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella presently says the company’s GitHub acquisition will close “in the blink of an eye.” The European Union approved the deal last week, and the $7.5 billion acquisition is a major part of Microsoft’s proceeded with push towards supporting the open source network.

On topic, Gamepass isn't doing well and it's yet another nail in the coffin when you look at what MS chooses to report (false information) and when you see an unbiased 3rd party (whose job is to accurately compile information) prove MS is lying. is that you Donald Trump? All the lying it must be. Last I checked Sony wasn’t putting their new games on their most expensive service which is crazy to me imagine if stranger things or anyother NetflixPrimeHuluGamepass original content made you wait years after they tried to sell it to you to add it to their services.",,BigOW,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

This shit right here is some next fanboy level of insight . I'm done. Jigsaah said: This whole conversation is irrelevant. -said no Sony Fanboy ever But honestly it's true. Fact of the matter is, Microsoft, Google and potentially Amazon is changing the entire landscape of gaming. They aren't flipping the narrative or moving the goal posts like Sony. They are strapping a nuke to the field and hitting the giant red ""RESET"" button. There is a paradigm shift coming in gaming. Microsoft saw it early on and are touting numbers in terms of users for a reason. Those who think it's because their sales are lower than Sony's...that's a very small part of it. They are preparing themselves for the likes of Amazon and Google, who are much bigger threats than Sony, not in terms of sales or anything trivial like that. Google is trying to get to the aforementioned red ""RESET"" button first. All 3 of these companies are working on cloud services for their games. Sony is going to either have to align with one of them or get left in the dust. The best they have is Gaikai right now for PSNow. They are going to be 3 years late to the party for backwards compatibility. Them sticking to their guns while everybody else is evolving is not going to be a good thing for them. I'm sure they'll make their money, but when the Playstation is the only real thing they got going for them...it just doesn't seem smart to not keep up. You guys can rest on your laurels if you want, but if you're a real fan of Sony, you need to be more forward thinking and stop reveling in stats that won't matter in a couple of years.

Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015.

The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court.

It's the same reason why the tie ratio for software on PS4 won't be double that of Xbox despite the hardware sales being double. The more mainstream your product (the more you sell), the more consumers you attract who might only buy one or two games per year. The same deal is for streaming. Currently, the more likely user to subscribe to these services are those who already spend quite a lot of money on games anyway (""hardcore"" gamers). The trick going forward is getting more mainstream users signing up. No one has cracked that yet. And as for Sony, working out the revenue % we're seeing approx 2.3m PSNow subscribers. Sony makes nowhere near as much noise as MS does for Game Pass and yet they snagged 2.3m subscribers. And this is BEFORE PSNow downloads feature. No doubt as Sony focuses more on PSNow, releasing more appealing titles for it and releasing it for mobilea the figures will shoot up.",,ooombasa,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I've played 4 and Shelter (a completely different but fun game). I loved 3 so much that it YLOD my PS3 so I missed out on New Vegas. If I ever bite the bullet and subscribe to PlayStation Now, Vegas would be my first game I play. Good job tackling those two DLCs! I was on my way to do the aliens one but I was so underpowered I was scared off. Then I stumbled onto Anchorage much later and felt so disconnected and confused by it, as I did no research and just bought the GOTY edition at a good deal.

After you play the game for a while, some or all zombies will turn into these headless bandits or just lose their heads in general, making them unkillable and the game basically unplayable (and potentially corrupting your save file). The only way to ""fix"" the issue is to kill Marston, and even then it'll just pop up again after 15-30 minutes or so. It's a good thing for Rockstar this only started happening after everyone had already moved on to GTA V, and people only started noticing the glitches when RDR was made playable on the Xbone and on PSNow streaming. Did they fix anything? gently caress no. Did any news outlet report the game was broken? gently caress no.

While some companies have resisted what they have decried as an overreach by city tax collectors, who are desperately trying to plug a massive budget hole while supporting some of the most under-funded public pensions in the country, Sony has become the latest video gaming company to acquiesce to the city's demands. Meanwhile, Nintendo and Microsoft (which owns Xbox) have been collecting the levies since 2015. According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry. ""If a business is not collecting the tax where we believe it applies, the city takes the necessary steps and works with the company to ensure compliance with the law,"" he said. The tax will now apply PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax.

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable",,Millwright,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,GOV/MIL Tax games: Chicago PlayStation users furious at new city fee,,,

According to the Chicago Tribune, the citys amusement tax once only applied to concerts and sporting event tickets, but several streaming companies like Netflix and Hulu have bowed to the city's demands since the levy was first expanded. Apple, on the other hand, filed a lawsuit against the city back in August alleging that the tax on its streaming service was ""illegal and discriminatory"". The company isn't paying the tax while the case works its way through a Cook County court. Previously, a group of streaming companies including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, XBox Live and Hulu sued Chicago back in 2015 alleging that the tax was in violation of federal law. However, the judge ruled in the citys favor in May. After an appeal, the case is awaiting a ruling from an appellate court. Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, told the Tribune that the city ""uniformly enforces the amusement tax,"" and neglected to address the outcry.

That's according to new research from SuperData which says that the top three services generated six per cent of total premium PC and console revenue for that period. The company claims that subscribers pay 45 per cent more for games 'upfront' than non-subscribers. Meanwhile, this audience spends twice the amount than non-subscribers. PlayStation Now is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the dominant service by some margin, generate 52 per cent of venue. This is likely due to the sheer install base of the PlayStation 4, which stands at over 86m units sold since its November 2013 launch. Second place - by some way - is EA Access on Xbox One with a 16 per cent slice of the pie, while Xbox Game Pass claims 15 per cent of the sector's cash.

Starting November 14, residents should expect an increase on their PlayStation Store receipts, which include “PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Now, PlayStation Vue, PlayStation Music, PlayStation Video On Demand, and PlayStation Video Live Events.” The tax isn't popular in the city of Chicago, but Emanuel says the taxes are necessary to shore up the city's pensions. Several companies like Apple and Netflix are taking action against the city for the taxes, but until any changes are made, PlayStation gamers are now subject to the same tax as other amusement activities. ====================::==================== This a deal compared to our 10.25% sales tax!",,Catboxer,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Chicago Gamers Will Have to Pay an Extra Tax on PlayStation Store Purchases Soon,,,

Either way not worth it from Sony's perspective. I'm totally fine with them having exclusives to their systems. Microsoft owns Windows and the store that goes with it. With the UWP push it only makes sense for them to invest on PC. Sony are in a very different place and their strategy does not have to include releasing games on PC. Sure, they have PSNow but it's only streaming.",,Laddertoheaven,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Gamers firing up their consoles on Wednesday were greeted with a message from Sony informing them that the tax will now be applied to all PlayStation subscription services, like PlayStation Now, PlayStation Plus, and PlayStation Music. Regular game purchases from the PlayStation store are untouched by the tax. Chicagoans already pay a raft of city, county, and state taxes including levies on bottled water and cell phones, as well as the highest sales taxes of any major US city. Gamers and pundits were quick to vent their frustrations at the latest tax on Twitter. While the tax was applied to PlayStation users on Wednesday, Xbox and Nintendo users have been paying the fee since 2015, as have Netflix and Hulu subscribers. Chicago has used the amusement tax to take a cut from sporting events, concerts, movies, nightclubs, and more for decades. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel added online streaming and gaming services to the tax in 2015, in a bid to raise some extra cash and chip away at the citys over $400 million budget deficit. Some companies have refused outright to charge their users. Apple is currently taking the city to court over the tax, claiming that Chicago has violated the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) with its illegal and discriminatory tax on amusement. Signed into law by Bill Clinton, the ITFA prevents state and local governments from taxing Internet access, or imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. For instance, users already pay for an internet connection. The IFTA states that they should not be penalized for choosing to stream a movie over this connection rather than purchase a physical copy in a store. When gaming and streaming were added to the tax in 2015, Emanuels administration was struggling to afford $530 million in increased payments to police and firefighter pension funds for the following year. Now, with the citys police force struggling to contain a violent crime epidemic that has seen the citys murder rate spike to 765 in 2016 (up from an average of 454 a decade earlier), gamers who dont want to pay the tax need only to walk outside their door to find scenes more violent than anything the designers of Grand Theft Auto could come up with. https://www.rt.com/usa/443987-chicag...amusement-tax/ Proud Infidel and Cracker Member : Nowski Brigade Deplorable",,Millwright,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,GOV/MIL Tax games: Chicago PlayStation users furious at new city fee,,,
