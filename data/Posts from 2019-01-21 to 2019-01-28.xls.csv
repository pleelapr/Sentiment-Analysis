PLEASE do NOT take my icons and crop them to be your own. 

I’ve been noticing this on here and a few locations on DW (I don’t wanna point fingers or toss names and make things worse ) This is your final warning, if I see it again, I will not hesitate to block you, IP and all from accessing my blog. I’m not going to redo my icons for the third time, I’d rather just block you and move on with my day. This is a hobby, don’t make me treat it like work.

Now you’re all probably going “queenie you didn’t draw anything” but that’s the kicker, I maybe not have drawn anything but I have edited quite a few shots from the game to make my own unique icons. On top of that I’ve colored and drawn in parts from the art book as well. So please, don’t take anything from this blog, it’s for my use only.

Also for the time being, Catherine’s not a blog I’ll be on, it got hit by the stupid nsfw bs and I can’t unlock it so, I’ll have to migrate it to a new blog when I have her muse.

Now that that’s all off the table, I am planning on dusting this blog off. Been replaying Catherine on PC /PSnow and getting ready for my blind Full Body run, which I might stream since we got an elgato for outselves over the holidays.",,bridesorder,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,,Post,,

Could you give an example of how Microsoft continuously sets the bar, possibly an example of when it didn't have them trailing Sony? Game Pass being a digital renting service, after the success of Game Pass why did Sony suddenly allow you to download the games from PSNow instead of Streaming them? Xbox Live paved the way for Console Online gaming when the OG Xbox had the ability out of the box, Sony had to release a clunky add-on peripheral for the fat PS2 and then release an entirely new model of PS2 with the ability to connect online built in while the OG Xbox had it out of the box. The Elite Controller, there is a reason it is the gold standard in Controllers and why Nintendo and Steam copied the design. Sony is yet to release an official Controller that can equal or surpass the Elite. Internal Harddrives, the OG Xbox had one out of the box while all versions of the PS2 was still using Memory Cards. It was not until the PS3 that Sony added internal HDD's, a full Console Gen after the OG Xbox had one out of the box.",,agentspoon,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

And now, the game of musical chairs has begun once again, with rumors swirling and even some outright official talk from both Sony and Microsoft about their next generation of game consoles. With such a huge lead, it's Sony's game to lose - and there are some worrying signs that Sony's repeating the same mistakes Microsoft did when it introduced the Xbox One. The cross-play debacle And now Sony is showing early signs of making those same mistakes. What's up at Sony? In a New York Times interview ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in early January, Sony Corporation CEO Kenichiro Yoshida laid out his plans for integrating the enormously popular PlayStation Network - the digital backbone of the PlayStation consoles - with Sony's music and movie businesses. According to Yoshida, PlayStation Network is ""a very strong entertainment platform for all of Sony - very suitable for video and music content."" Traditionally, Sony has kept its gaming, music, and movie businesses siloed off from each other. In the coming years, he said, those groups have been instructed to work together more closely. While he's not wrong about PlayStation Network's ability as a digital service to enable content purchases and management, it's a service purpose-built for the most recent PlayStation game consoles. While PlayStation Network could be expanded into an ""entertainment"" service, it shouldn't be. Core gaming audiences have repeatedly demonstrated their lack of interest in gaming platforms being broadened. Look no further than Microsoft's announcement of the Xbox One - the focus on television, sports, and ""smart"" functionality was a perfect trifecta of bad press for the console. with all the evidence gathered what do you guys think? Sony trying to convert its very popular gaming service into an ""entertainment"" service demonstrates a lack of understanding about why people love PlayStation. It handles gaming very well, and attempts to broaden that are likely to be balked at by its most loyal users. Couple that with the cross-play situation, and you've got two clear signs of Sony demonstrating hubris - similar to how Microsoft acted before and after introducing a console that many people didn't want. Some of that had to do with Microsoft's Xbox leadership at the time, which was going through a lot of changes. Sony is seemingly going through the same thing, with execs being swapped all over the place. Former PlayStation CEO Shawn Layden is no longer in charge of PlayStation - now it's John Kodera. The company's latest CEO, Kenichiro Yoshida, is the man quoted above speaking about PlayStation Network; he became CEO in April 2018, and he replaced former PlayStation leader-turned-CEO Kaz Hirai. Yoshida's background is in finance. That said, we're still at least a year, if not more, from new Xbox and PlayStation consoles - rumors point to 2020 as the year for new hardware. Sony is far from the position that Microsoft was in during that first year of the Xbox One's life, but recent signs point to exactly the type of shift we saw at Microsoft before the launch of the Xbox One.",,ThanosSupreme,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I just had to say that GOW 2 was a masterpiece, the game still holds up today and is much better than the majority of ps4 games. The game seemingly has it all and I’d have trouble finding much fault with the game. It edges GOW 3 for me because the boss fights actually felt like fights rather than drawn out qte sequences. After playing through some old games on psnow I’m kinda shocked that games liked GOW 2 and DMC 3 might be better than any pure action game I’ve played on ps4. I discount souls games because I consider them action Rpg. After watching the ps4 game, it seems so different from the previous entries. The camera, shield, rpg elements, combat, etc.... I thought after 3, Santa Monica should have just made a new IP since this god of war stays so far away from previous titles. Maybe they are milking it, but I think they would kill it with a new IP.

I got it for I think $60 for a year which is half of what I would normally pay for it. Meanwhile PSNow has only been $20/month as far as I know. The other thing to consider with these services is how much revenue it brought to the platform as a whole. I've said it before but at a point, GamePass is almost like a loss leader to get people into the ecosystem and make customers feel comfortable with spending more in other areas such as DLC, Microtransactions, or sales on non-service games.

The company has been trying to reduce its reliance on the all-important iPhone business, which has arguably peaked at this point. Instead, the tech titan has been building up its services segment, which is more profitable and generates consistent recurring revenue. Apple isn't the only one An old vintage Japanese market version of the Nintendo 'Family Computer' video game console knows also as 'Famicom' (R) released in 1983 in Japan next to the latest video game console the 'Nintendo Switch' (L) released in 2017. Photo: Photo by Guillaume Payen/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Creating the ""Netflix of games"" Cheddar reports that Apple is working on a gaming service that would be a sort of "" Netflix for games,"" allowing users to access a catalog of games for a subscription fee. The Mac maker reportedly discussed the notion with game developers late last year. Apple has even considered becoming a publisher, according to Cheddar. In the video game industry, a publisher typically takes on marketing and distribution while also often providing financial backing. If Apple were to take on that role, it could try to finance exclusive titles only available on iOS as a means of differentiation. The vast majority of mobile games are cross-platform compatible, as developers look for the broadest distribution. Android is the largest mobile platform, but iOS generally offers much stronger monetization. It's also worth noting that games make up an overwhelming proportion of overall spending on the App Store, representing a massive 75% of consumer spending despite accounting for just 31% of downloads in 2017, according to App Annie. Everybody's doing it The news comes shortly after Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) CEO Satya Nadella detailed a game service that the software giant is working on, except Microsoft wants to stream games to devices. The company had announced ""Project xCloud"" in October, and Microsoft would leverage its Azure cloud computing platform to deliver console-quality games to any device. ""We describe it as, shorthand, 'Netflix for games,'"" Nadella said earlier this month. Microsoft plans to start testing the service later this year. Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) is similarly developing a game-streaming service, according to The Information, but it isn't expected to launch until 2020. The e-commerce giant has the largest cloud computing platform in the world (AWS), as well as one of the largest video game live-streaming platforms (Twitch). Amazon has active job listings for software engineers to work on cloud games. Alphabet subsidiary Google is also working on a cloud gaming service. Sony ( NYSE:SNE ) was an early pioneer with PlayStation Now, a game-streaming service that launched in 2015. However, PlayStation Now's technical performance is lacking, and the service hasn't really moved the needle for Sony or the industry. Sony also offers PlayStation Plus, a subscription that also includes access to a catalog of free and discounted games. Apple's rumored service doesn't seem to have a streaming component, so presumably users would still need to download any included titles. While that model would differ, it would still compete with other subscription-based game services. Whether Apple can make the economics work remains to be seen.

I also use a service known as Geforce Now, it's still in beta but it basically does the same thing as PSnow, but for PC games and it streams at 1080p, up to 120 FPS. ​ Meanwhile, PSnow is locked at 720p, 60fps. ​ The reason why it's fast is that it splits the video into several segments and sends those segments all at the same time, kind of like how a download accelerator splits the download file into several segments. Then the PSnow client puts the segments together, this is exactly how live TV has worked for decades. And since you're only sending back basic input data, that can easily be sent back more or less instantaneously. ​ It's really that we just have faster internet speeds nowadays. ​ There are slight delays in input though, you won't feel it for most games, but you will for the reflex-heavy ones like For Honor, Dark Souls 2, and Bloodborne.",,Joelblaze,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

BC is a convenient gimmick, but for me, the single biggest thing that encourage me to get an Xbone again (I had gotten rid of it some time back) was Gamepass. It's a fantastic deal, and both content and price-wise, just knocks PSNow out of the water, so even though 90% of my gaming is on PS4, I find myself booting up the Xbone a few nights a week to play whatever is new on Gamepass (I recommend Mutant Year Zero, Hellblade, Mortal Kombat X, and Shantae!).",,KornyMunky,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

But I've also found some articles stating that Sony killed that idea again. So asking here now. What I've found out so far is this: The following Sony Blu-ray players supports DualShock4: BDP-BX350 BDP-BX370 BDP-BX650 BDP-S1500 BDP-S1700 BDP-S2500 BDP-S3500 BDP-S3700 BDP-S5500 BDP-S6500 BDP-S6700 UHP-H1 - but only the CUH-ZCT1Uxx models - not the CUH-ZCT2Uxx models. So first question: Are there other newer Blu-ray players that supports the CUH-ZCT2Uxx DualShock4? 2nd question: When connecting a DualShock4 controller to my Blu-ray player, can I then also use it as a remote control for navigating Blu-ray movies, like it works on a PlayStation 3 and Playstation 4? (I.e. R1 = next chapter, R2 = Fast forward, Square = POPUP menu, X = Select and so on). 3rd question goes: Is it true that Sony has killed this idea again, and that only the PS4 supports the ""PlayStation Now"" network now? That would be a shame. It sounds like a rather good idea. But even if streaming of games wouldn't be possible, there'd still be reasons to make it possible to connect a gamepad, for Blu-ray games.",,MisthaLu-DK,Netherlands,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Which Blu-ray players can I connect a DualShock to...,,,

I get so tired of deleting games because each disc is DRM since I'm downloading the damn game anyway. It just turns me off every time I buy a game.

All the games people are creaming themselves over I think are just kind of 'meh'. I have a Switch but you can definitely argue it's targeted towards the retro minded. This one interests me because I enjoyed this game back like... what, 20 years ago? As far as PC gaming, I used to use Steam a lot. My laptop is pretty decent and I haven't really had any problems playing a game when I decide to boot one up but I rarely break that out. My desktop is strictly for music now and I have that upstairs in a room no one goes in. I dunno, where I'm at with family, work, etc... it's hard to sit down and just devote tons of time at once to games. Switch is nice because it's on the go, Atari is nice because it's like 15 minute bursts, etc... I've considered getting an external hard drive strictly for my Xbox but then I feel like I'm getting into the PC gaming realm where I have to get upgrades and move on to new things and just damn... I want my console so I pop the game in and just play. Nice, quick, and easy. Consoles have left that. The night I got my Xbox One I was so disappointed when I popped Injustice 2 in and I had to download... and I wasn't able to play my console until the next day. You guys can say it's petty or stupid reasons, that's fine. I get where you're coming from. I think I've just gotten to the point where modern stuff just isn't for me anymore.

Sony doesn’t offer PS1 games on PS4 (and Vita support is pretty much dead at this point) and Nintendo ended the Virtual Console with the Switch (even though the 3DS had it, they stopped releasing titles). Instead, backwards compatibility is limited to sub based systems like PlayStation Now and the Switch online membership. At the same time, we’ve been getting tons of $40+ remasters, HD collections, and mini consoles, some that run, look, and/or play worse than the originals. Don’t get me wrong, I love me a quality remasters or remake and (good) HD collections are a great way to get into a new series or replay favorites, but with how gutted backwards compatibility has become and the end of the Virtual Console type programs, I’ve become much more cynical. The Mario and Luigi $40 3DS versions really sealed it for me.

I also like using it for typing on the ps4. Other than that, the games I have played use it like kind of a Select button, which is fine but it's disappointing that it wasn't used too much as a touchpad. As for it being on ps5, I'm scared they might remove either it or the sixasis (just like they removed the pressure sensor in the buttons for the ps4 controller) since if the ps5 is backwards compatible, or you want to play psnow games, there might be a few games that won't be as enjoyable as they were with their intended controller.",,Captain__Qwark,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Now actually, all this is wrong, because I had 3k vbucks on my PS4, and when I spent 2300 from PS4, instead of only deducting vbucks from PS4, it also got vbucks removed from PC, and even more than it was supposed to. The scenario should've went like this (exactly): - I have: 1250 vbucks on PC 3100 vbucks on PS4 - I bought Lace for 1500 vbucks and vision for 800 vbucks - PS4 should have 800 vbucks left PC should have 1050 vbucks left - I refunded vision (which got me 800 vbucks back) on both PC and PS4 - I bought a new emote for 500 vbucks - I bought Scythe (just now) for 800 vbucks I should be left with 550 vbucks on PC, since I spent the vbucks on the PS4 already, but instead, I have the vbucks on the PS4 as 500 and PC as 150 Hoping to receive a reply soon; thank you for your time. ====================::==================== Am I getting a reply from a moderator/admin any time soon?",,Fady_04,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,Vbucks Inquiry,,,

What honestly would they have to lose releasing say ""super SMASH Bros"" for XBOX and PS4? Or Super Mario Galaxy in 4k? These games would probably be as big as games like Halo and God of War. I would have no doubt. I understand their commitment of protecting their games, but they could still do their portables (including Switch) and I think they would still be making as much money as they are now, and arguably, more money. I know this leaves a dirty taste in Nintendo fans mouths, but I just think of the possibilities of what they could do finally joining forces with their long time competition. A universal console where we can play Halo, Zelda, Mario bros and God of war in 4K, online, all in the same day and on the same console. Hey, I can dream can't I? And I'm a HUGE Nintendo guy, have been since day one. Until then, I'll cherish my Wii U, and Switch. And maybe, just maybe, wait for the inevitable. I will take criticism as I expect to get some bringing this up again. But I would like the real reasons why this would be bad for Nintendo or bad for gamers? Or could it just be a positive thing? ====================::==================== I think the future of videogames will be a streaming / download / digital only service. As such, yes, we will likely play Nintendo on 3rd party hardware in the future, alongside Sony's and MS's 1st party, 15-20 years from now. You can play Sega and Atari games on Amazon Fire TV today. I am sure starting with MS's GamePass, then PlayStation Now and finally Nintendo Entertainment System, everyone will eventually be primarily invested in a service business with a hardware option on the side.",,gencid,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,You think we'll ever see Nintendo on a competitors console and could they be successful doing so?,,,

Or worse, relegate all BC to that PSNow rubbish, so even if you own the game, they'll expect you to pay again to access it on the newer console.

If they do, they'll sell it as it's own game. From a business point of view, it makes no sense at ALL to sell something for 20 bucks when you could sell it for 60. Also, I'd rather the team work on RDR3 than rehashing the same story. Also also, it's on playstation now (game stream) and xbox has backwards compatibility. It's not so old that it needs a remaster. I mean, as I write that I know that Dark Souls came out a full year after RDR1, but remastering dark souls was upgrading some textures and maybe some gameplay. It was profitable to remaster. Doing RDR1 is going to be cutscenes and missions.

What honestly would they have to lose releasing say ""super SMASH Bros"" for XBOX and PS4? Or Super Mario Galaxy in 4k? These games would probably be as big as games like Halo and God of War. I would have no doubt. I understand their commitment of protecting their games, but they could still do their portables (including Switch) and I think they would still be making as much money as they are now, and arguably, more money. I know this leaves a dirty taste in Nintendo fans mouths, but I just think of the possibilities of what they could do finally joining forces with their long time competition. A universal console where we can play Halo, Zelda, Mario bros and God of war in 4K, online, all in the same day and on the same console. Hey, I can dream can't I? And I'm a HUGE Nintendo guy, have been since day one. Until then, I'll cherish my Wii U, and Switch. And maybe, just maybe, wait for the inevitable. I will take criticism as I expect to get some bringing this up again. But I would like the real reasons why this would be bad for Nintendo or bad for gamers? Or could it just be a positive thing? ====================::==================== ohioguy24 said: ↑ gencid said: ↑ I think the future of videogames will be a streaming / download / digital only service.

182190027352,1/21/2019,http://immedtech.tumblr.com/post/182190027352,"Streaming detonated the film and television industries. As recently as five years ago, the advent of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube Premium sounded the death knell for multi-billion dollar businesses, altered the living-room habits of millions of people, and changed studio production structures permanently. Companies that adapted survived, and the viewing audience received a handful of clear benefits in return – most notably the ability to watch high-quality shows and movies on demand and, most recently, an explosion of award-winning, culturally transformative entertainment options.

Now, it’s video games’ turn. The idea of a “Netflix for games” service has been floating around since long before video-streaming became a thing, but it hasn’t found a solid foothold quite yet. Streaming games is a more complicated process than streaming video, since it adds user input to the mix. While being piped into a player’s home or phone from a server that could be hundreds of miles away, the game has to respond, without lag, to every button press a player makes. Think Bandersnatch on steroids and with much higher stakes, especially for competitive games like Fortnite and multiplayer Call of Duty and Overwatch.



The technology and infrastructure necessary for consumer-scale, seamless game-streaming is nearly here. NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Verizon and more major companies are making moves in this space, and they finally have the server dispersion and broadband support necessary to roll out their own Netflix-style services as early as this year.

Streaming will alter the video game industry just like it did film and TV. On top of further disrupting the flailing physical market (GameStop might just be the Blockbuster of the game-streaming apocalypse), distributors will likely hold an inordinate amount of power over a game’s visibility, pushing it onto the main screen or pulling it into the recesses of the search bar based on unknowable algorithmic variables. If each platform becomes as crowded as Steam or the App Store (or Netflix, for that matter), this means smaller, independent games could find it difficult to grab screen time. Low visibility doesn’t just impact potential revenue – projected sales affect how much funding developers can secure from investors, as described by gamesindustry.biz.

But at this point, nothing is going to stop the cloud-gaming train. As it comes screeching into the station in 2019, here’s where eight major companies stand.



Verizon

Here’s one fresh off the rumor mill: Verizon is currently quietly testing a game-streaming service called Verizon Gaming, as first reported by The Verge earlier in January. Verizon is apparently testing the service on a handful of NVIDIA Shield set-top boxes; the alpha version includes 135 games, including AAA hits like Destiny 2, Red Dead Redemption 2, Fortnite and God of War. Participants are reportedly promised a $150 Amazon gift card, alongside receiving a Shield and Xbox One controller.

The plan, according to Verge, is to eventually roll out Verizon Gaming on Android devices. The company hasn’t officially announced Verizon Gaming, but it’s openly building the infrastructure to support such a system. Verizon is making a big push for 5G, the next-generation broadband network that will likely enable average connection speeds of 300 Mbps. Note that Google’s cloud-gaming test required a connection of 25 Mbps, at least.

“We frequently conduct internal and external proof-of-concept trials to explore new ways to enrich the customer experience and expand our portfolio of products and services,” a Verizon spokesperson told Engadget.



Google

Speaking of Google, the company recently held a beta test for Project Stream, a service that promises to run any game on any laptop or PC via the Chrome browser. It required a connection of 25 Mbps, but even at that low end of the broadband spectrum, Project Stream worked well. The beta went live in October and Google wasn’t shy about enticing people to give it a go.

Google has a clear advantage in the streaming space with a vast and robust server infrastructure, and it already has streaming devices in tens of millions of houses with Chromecast.

We learned at CES 2019 that Project Stream uses AMD Radeon graphics (no word on whether that means the coming Radeon VII), rather than any of NVIDIA’s offerings. Which brings us to Geforce Now.



NVIDIA

Geforce Now is the closest thing we have to a subscription-based, consumer-ready game-streaming service, and it’s been running for the past three years. However, it’s been in beta the entire time (currently available on PC, Mac and Shield devices), and the company hasn’t made any announcements about a wide-scale launch. However, Geforce Now is impressive. It supports more than 400 games and generally offers a stutter-free gaming experience.

The company is continually updating Geforce Now alongside Shield upgrades, recently adding support for in-game voice chat and streamlined Twitch sharing.



Amazon

Amazon already has a footprint in a slightly different game-streaming space: Twitch. Amazon bought Twitch for nearly $1 billion in 2014, and since then it’s grown into a cultural touchstone, hosting celebrities, taking over mainstream headlines, and helping turn live-streaming into a lucrative career for some creators. Add this acumen and brand recognition to Amazon’s Fire TV efforts and Lumberyard game engine, and the company has a clear spot in the cloud-gaming race.

Amazon is building a game-streaming service a la Project Stream, though it’s unlikely to launch before 2020, according to The Information. That’s about all we know so far, and Amazon didn’t respond to Engadget’s request for comment.



Microsoft

The house of Xbox announced Project xCloud in October, with an emphasis on streaming games to PCs, phones and tablets. However, that’s surely not where Microsoft’s ambition ends – the next generation of consoles is on its way and Xbox is reportedly working on hardware designed specifically to support cloud gaming, due out in 2020.

Project xCloud hasn’t launched just yet, but Microsoft is planning a beta test this year. Microsoft is in a similar position as Google – it’s spent the past decade or so building out Azure, a robust cloud network that should help keep latency low. Plus, there’s the Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft is preparing its audience for a subscription-based future, offering access to more than 200 games for $10 a month, though unlike PlayStation Now, these aren’t streamed.

After Sony pulled out of E3 2019 completely, Xbox is poised to own the show this summer (and maybe even the next hardware generation entirely), and it may offer more details about its streaming plans then.



Sony

Sony was an early adopter in the cloud renaissance, buying Gaikai in 2012 and OnLive in 2015, and launching the PlayStation Now game-streaming service in 2014. PlayStation Now is still running today, but it offers subpar streaming capabilities. It’s more of a case study in how streaming used to be, rather than where it’s going.

Sony hasn’t made any recent announcements about its approach to streaming and it won’t be at E3 this year. Of course, there are still plans for the future of PlayStation and executives promise we’ll hear more throughout 2019.

Electronic Arts

EA isn’t building a cloud-gaming platform, but it is working on the technology that could power a streaming-first ecosystem. Project Atlas is EA’s upcoming cloud-gaming-development platform, and it’s designed to help creators build games from the ground-up with streaming in mind.

This move makes sense for EA. It owns the Frostbite engine, which currently powers franchises such as Dragon Age, FIFA, Madden and Battlefield, and it runs the digital Origin store, which features monthly subscription options. EA bought GameFly’s cloud-gaming technology and personnel in mid-2018 (not its streaming business, mind), and by October, CTO Ken Moss had announced Project Atlas.

EA’s vision of cloud gaming involves creating a social, constantly connected universe where developers can craft personalized and immersive experiences for players, all driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Moss has ambitious goals for Project Atlas, as he described in a Medium post:
EA’s vision of cloud gaming involves creating a social, constantly connected universe. 
“Project Atlas is designed to seamlessly converge EA’s Frostbite game engine and game services as well as artificial intelligence  – giving rise to a new game development platform, optimized for a cloud-enabled world. This will be a fully integrated platform, capable of building the scalable, social, and large-scale experiences of the future.”

Nintendo

Yes, Nintendo – the company that was years behind the competition when it came to implementing online and social features in its games and consoles – is experimenting with streaming. Players in Japan can stream Resident Evil 7 and Assassin’s Creed Odyss",,immedtech,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Who will be the first Netflix for video games?,Post,,

Not trophy boosting, no server worries, just single player games which I would eventually 100% complete and platinum. Played some awesome games so far and recently went through the Yakuza trilogy (Zero, Kiwami and Kiwami2). So could you guys recommend some awesome single player only games. Either disc based or digital is fine just as long as I can 100% them on my own. I've played tonnes of games over the years so not missing out by having a specific profile like this if thats what you think, and I still have my other profile for online gaming with pals. There will be the obvious choices which will get named a few times and thats fine, because that shows what awesome games they are. Also. I'm not doing this for quick and easy to build up some kind of competitive profile. Its just a single player only profile which gives me awesome games to play. A few I want to consider. Vampyr. Is this any good? I know it has a select following and people rave about the story but dislike the combat mechanics. Should this game be bought when its on sale rather than paying full whack? Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2. These were nice games back on orginal release and I can't remember most of what went on. But does a splash of paint for remastered visuals mean anything if the game feels old and clunky to play? Are there any racing games (more towards realistic vehicles rather than goofy cartoon stuff)? Wish they made Elite single player only completion as that would have been amazing. Top game but has online crap that I can't be bothered with. Anyhoo. Suggestions please. ====================::==================== ill just throw out most, if not all, of what i have that is single player only. i recommend them all, they're great fun. do you care about DLC? some of these might have DLC trophies. i only own a PS4, i played all these games on their PS4 releases or through PSNow on my PS4. Darksiders 1, 2, and 3. little bit of zelda, little bit of GoW, little bit of Souls, all round a great series, play the remastered versions of 1 and 2, 3 is pretty new. God of War games, for obvious reasons. classic game series. (ascension technically has one trophy linked to its multiplayer mode, but all you have to do is complete the tutorial which can be done solo) Infamous 1, 2, and Second Son. really fun open world series with a great story and really fun gameplay. (2 has trophies linked to user generated missions, but they can be done solo as well) Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian. cannot recommend these enough, incredible and beautiful games all made by my favorite game devs of all time. Shadow of the Colossus is the best of the 3 by far. Dishonored 1 and 2. Stealth based gameplay is one of my favorites, and these games do it right. the same developer also made... Prey. i was completely surprised by how good this game was. absolutely amazing sci fi story, with about a billion different ways to do everything. Horizon Zero Dawn. another impressive new IP that emerged. the creature design in this game really wins it for me, so creative and cool. Kingdom Hearts. all of it. the series holds a special place in my heart, but i truly believe they are great games even without the nostalgia. the developer Telltale games m̶a̶k̶e̶s̶ made great visual-novel style games, if you're into that choose-your-own-adventure stuff. ive played Game of Thrones, Tales From the Borderlands, and Walking Dead South Park: The Stick of Truth and Fractured But Whole. if you like south parks brand of humor anyway. if not, then maybe avoid these lol Spider-Man. what more needs to be said? Spidey has always been the best superhero to play in video games. The Order: 1886. VERY short but decent. can be found cheap. Far Cry Primal. animal companions in this are fun. never played other FC games but this caveman one is good Resident Evil 7. if you like horror games, this a new take on a classic series. Nioh. guide says some of the trophies require an internet connection, but i think its just so the game can update the missions that change. Soulsborne series. these games have multiplayer functions kinda laced through them, so if you want to avoid them i understand. pretty sure you can play in offline mode and plat them though. correct me if im wrong. Mirror's Edge Catalyst. excellent parkour gameplay. very smooth, and decent graphics. (again, user generated content trophies.) Asura's Wrath. very over the top anime style storytelling. heavy action. super fun. the recent remasters of classic ps1 and ps2 titles are also great choices. personally i picked up the Jak and Daxter series and the Spyro trilogy. wow. uhhh, sorry. that turned into a lot.

Microsoft -- Their early mistakes with the Xbox One have caused them to focus on being incredibly consumer-centric with the best monthly free games (Games with Gold), mod-support, backwards compatibility going back two generations, X-Box Game Pass, and free PC/Xbox crossbuy on digital titles. 2. Sony -- After ending the Xbox brand at E3 2013 and being the consumer champion the previous generation, Sony has really gone backwards. Charging a yearly fee for PSN has meant that (with some exceptions) the free games are paltry at best. PSN does typically have the best and most frequent sales on their online store. Mod-support for games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 does exist but it's much more restricted than on Xbox. The only subscription service available on Playstation is the Playstation Now streaming service that is twice the price of Xbox Game pass. It has improved though from the standpoint that many Playstation 4 titles can now be downloaded directly to the system. Services like EA Access were not allowed on PSN due to perceived competition with Sony's own service. Backwards compatibility does exist but only from the standpoint of PS2 classics. The PS2 games have to be re-purchased on PSN. They do upscale to 1080p with Trophy support, but support for additional PS2 classics on PS4 seems all but dead after the initial wave of games. Many people are also not fans of Sony's hardline stance against cross-platform play (Although I dislike crossplatform play on any competitive multiplayer title). 3. Nintendo -- Their hardline anti-emulation stance really irks me, especially given that they have used ROMs downloaded from the internet on their online stores for the Wii/Wii U/3DS. Emulation, especially when we're talking about emulating decades old games. It's obvious that Nintendo sees emulation as competition with NES Online, but people will buy that service to play classic games on the Switch not just to play them in general. Nintendo's design philosophy behind the consoles they develop also seems geared towards milking the consumer for as many accessories as possible. The Switch Joycon is $80 for both the left and right and $50 for a single pack. The Switch Pro Controller (which I do recommend if you play the Switch primarily in docked mode) costs $70. Admittedly I think the Wii was the biggest offender with all the things you could plug into the Wii-Mote. Their online service is cheaper than the competition's, but NES Online is lackluster thus far. It's clear that they are slowly dripping out games to add to the service in order to keep you subscribed, there are no dedicated servers for online multiplayer, and not every game supports cloud saving. There games are also almost always full price or never any cheaper than $40 regardless of how long they've been out unless we're talking about re-releases like Nintendo Select (which doesn't exist for Switch yet).",,BulldogXero,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

What honestly would they have to lose releasing say ""super SMASH Bros"" for XBOX and PS4? Or Super Mario Galaxy in 4k? These games would probably be as big as games like Halo and God of War. I would have no doubt. I understand their commitment of protecting their games, but they could still do their portables (including Switch) and I think they would still be making as much money as they are now, and arguably, more money. I know this leaves a dirty taste in Nintendo fans mouths, but I just think of the possibilities of what they could do finally joining forces with their long time competition. A universal console where we can play Halo, Zelda, Mario bros and God of war in 4K, online, all in the same day and on the same console. Hey, I can dream can't I? And I'm a HUGE Nintendo guy, have been since day one. Until then, I'll cherish my Wii U, and Switch. And maybe, just maybe, wait for the inevitable. I will take criticism as I expect to get some bringing this up again. But I would like the real reasons why this would be bad for Nintendo or bad for gamers? Or could it just be a positive thing? ====================::==================== ohioguy24 said: ↑ gencid said: ↑ I think the future of videogames will be a streaming / download / digital only service. As such, yes, we will likely play Nintendo on 3rd party hardware in the future, alongside Sony's and MS's 1st party, 15-20 years from now. You can play Sega and Atari games on Amazon Fire TV today. I am sure starting with MS's GamePass, then PlayStation Now and finally Nintendo Entertainment System, everyone will eventually be primarily invested in a service business with a hardware option on the side.

182191368177,1/21/2019,http://ana-foodz.tumblr.com/post/182191368177,"Given huge mobile gaming market, 5G and cloud could provide a big boost to on-the-go gamers

Spurred by mega-hit games like Fortnite and PUBG, mobile gaming is quickly becoming a massive market that operators and the telecoms ecosystem at large can not only support but also monetize. According to analysis compiled by Nielson company SuperData, in 2018 mobile platform gaming hit a $63.1 billion market value. Given the throughput and latency needs of creating a mobile gaming experience comparable to a console-based experience, the combination of 5G and edge compute can support continued growth in this valuable segment.

During the the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month in Las Vegas, Nevada, Intel demonstrated a cloud gaming experience running over a commercial 5G network set up inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Intel’s Jonathan Wood, senior director, Systems Architecture and Client Group, and general manager of business development for advanced technology, told RCR Wireless News, “We’re trying to show CES visitors what 5G is capable of. One of the great things we have in terms of new use cases is really providing high quality gaming on devices you would traditionally see on the high street.”

In the demo, a live 5G network connected to an Intel 2-in-1 to support Rise of the Tomb Raider. “We’re not talking high-end PCs here and gaming machines,” Wood said. “We’re talking very straight forward PCs. The way we do that is we that we’re actually bringing that compute closer to the device using low latency. We can rely on that computing to take place on the edge of the network, not necessarily on the device, and that provides fantastic graphics experience for our users. When we look at this cloud gaming use case where we’re having the gaming take place on an edge server, doing all the hard compute and hard processing, that makes life a lot easier for everybody.”

Here’s a video of the demo along with commentary from Wood.



Wood extended the paradigm of combining 5G and edge computing for cloud gaming to other use cases that would serve the interests of enterprise and industrial users, including facial recognition, AI and associated workflows and industrial robotics. “If we can do that at the edge of the network, that kind of changes the kind of devices we see. We can actually provide that compute very, very close to where the application is being consumed.”

From the operator perspective, The Verge recently broke a story that Verizon is testing a “Netflix-style cloud gaming service.” According to the report, “Verizon Gaming is already up and running on the Nvidia Shield set-top box and will, according to the company’s documentation, eventually make its way to Android smartphones.”

The Verge further reports: “For Verizon, cloud gaming could be a showcase for 5G broadband both in the home and on the go. The low latency and fast data speeds of 5G could solve for many of the hurdles that game streaming apps — such as Sony’s PlayStation Now — are dealing with today.”

“We work very closely with [the operator]ecosystem,” Wood said. “Intel actually provides an end-to-end capability. 5G is all about data. We’re working with them very closely to ensure they build out the capabilities within those networks so they can really take advantage of these new types of services. The wireless piece is a real significant game-changer with the low latency, but when you’re adding in all the other elements to this with the improvements and enhancements to compute, then you really have a complete end-to-end network, which is ready for primetime with 5G.”

I'd also like it if it didn't restrict half of the cool weapons so loving late in the game. Like, they could have at let me choose any weapon I want at the start on subsequent playthroughs. It would be cool to use stuff Simon's bowblade or Burial blade at some point but the game is loving over once you get it. Agreed on both points, honestly. I get having weapons be paced throughout the game for your first playthrough, but I think after you get an ending and see the credits, any weapon you've found on a previous playthrough should be available from the messengers in the Hunter's Dream on any subsequent run. If you want a fresh run you can still just pick one of the starting three, but if you want a full-game Burial Blade run or something, you can do that without it having to be NG+. That'd be great. Cowcaster posted: my time spent with bloodborne when i had access to it was a mostly arcane run where i grabbed the holy moonlight sword as early as possible and it owned, and i'd want to do it again just to sort of pick up where i left off, except the HMS is a dlc weapon so playstation now wouldn't offer me the luxury. I do really love the Holy Moonlight Sword. It's my favorite iteration on the Moonlight Greatsword in the whole series. The transformed mode is just so fluid and fun to use.

However, they're safe for now. That's the privilege of being entrenched as the market leader. The time you can't do that is when you're at the start of a new generation and have to build your install base over from scratch. Make no mistake, if Sony has learned nothing from its hubris during the PS3 launch, and we see *this* Microsoft launch the successor to Xbox One, there will be a reckoning. But ultimately people buy consoles for many different reasons. Pricing and launch day games will play the biggest role, with console features and company messaging bringing up the rear. I expect Microsoft to push Xbox Game Pass with the launch of the next Xbox **hard.** If they launch at the same price point as PS5 and are crazy enough to offer all their launch titles for $10/month it'll go over huge, huger still if the console is fully or even highly backwards compatible with Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Xbox and XGP subscribers instantly have access to 200+ games to choose from. Sony can try to compete with Playstation Now, but at this time they're still not putting out their top-tier titles on the service day one, and it currently costs $20/month. I've yet to try PSNow but the impressions I've read of the service have all been mediocre to bad due to its need to stream content and occasionally have players wait in queues to play popular titles. That reputation needs to be repaired before PS5 launches if Sony is going to compete with Xbox Game Pass, because Xbox Game Pass lets you download titles to your console using a similar licensing model as Games With Gold/Playstation Plus, meaning your gameplay experience is identical to what you would get if you bought all those games. Now, this could all end up irrelevant if Sony has great exclusive launch titles and Microsoft doesn't. People will still pay a premium for what they want to play the most. But there are limits to that, and if PS5 and a new Xbox are the same price, but gamers are essentially deciding between two PS5 titles for $120 extra or a year of Xbox Game Pass with access to hundreds of games including brand spanking new Xbox launch titles, there's going to be plenty of people jumping ship.",,wordyfard,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I died several times and kept getting the same guy. He was pretty good at distracting and dodging OoK but wasn’t dealing any damage to him. By about my 3rd attempt I noticed the guy (using the bloodletter) psychically couldn’t do any damage to OoK whatsoever. Like you’d see him landing hits that wouldn’t knock the lifebar down at all. On top of this it seemed he couldn’t receive any damage from OoK. I noticed he seemed to be showing me this as in he will distract while I fight. I could understand this being a glitch but over the several attempts the case was always the same. So what was this? I started to think some kind of hack from the PC PSNow account but that doesn’t inspire the DLC. Any thoughts?,,EdgarPhillipsLigotti,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I get so tired of deleting games because each disc is DRM since I'm downloading the damn game anyway. It just turns me off every time I buy a game. I was kind of considering it previously but I went to go play Dead Space on Xbox One and I had to delete games to install a 360 game... and then I was just disheartened by the whole experience all over again. Click to expand... Idk man that's a pretty small thing overall to just skip out on great games over. Click to expand... Really, I'm not huge on modern games, though. All the games people are creaming themselves over I think are just kind of 'meh'. I have a Switch but you can definitely argue it's targeted towards the retro minded. This one interests me because I enjoyed this game back like... what, 20 years ago? As far as PC gaming, I used to use Steam a lot. My laptop is pretty decent and I haven't really had any problems playing a game when I decide to boot one up but I rarely break that out. My desktop is strictly for music now and I have that upstairs in a room no one goes in. I dunno, where I'm at with family, work, etc... it's hard to sit down and just devote tons of time at once to games. Switch is nice because it's on the go, Atari is nice because it's like 15 minute bursts, etc... I've considered getting an external hard drive strictly for my Xbox but then I feel like I'm getting into the PC gaming realm where I have to get upgrades and move on to new things and just damn... I want my console so I pop the game in and just play. Nice, quick, and easy. Consoles have left that. The night I got my Xbox One I was so disappointed when I popped Injustice 2 in and I had to download... and I wasn't able to play my console until the next day. You guys can say it's petty or stupid reasons, that's fine. I get where you're coming from. I think I've just gotten to the point where modern stuff just isn't for me anymore. And it takes a really special game to bring me back into the fold. And, funny enough again, Cuphead is what inspired me to get an Xbox One. And yeah, I could have gotten that on PC, too. Click to expand... I wouldn't say it's petty. The modern gaming landscape is disenchanting in a lot of ways. Just look at how titles are dealt out in pieces with DLC these days and, as you mention, how nothing is plug and play anymore. Everything has a day one update, rarely is a game fully on the disc, and there's always some bullshit. I'm far less of a gamer these days myself for similar reasons. I would also say I just don't care for modern game design, but there are still great games, though rare these days, that follow old school methodologies. All I can really say to you is that I would try not to let it ruin your fun, but I understand it being a nuisance and find certain things irritating myself.",,AzureFlameX,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Like also that it can actually play 4k discs unlike ps4 pro. yes, do jump ship.... you will enjoy it more. i was a hard nosed playstation fanboy for years. people tend to talk smack about xbox ... and the earlier ones (og xbox, xbox 360) didn't really bring much to the table to win me over. but with the xbox one x i was sold.... it gives you not just last gen backwards compatibility but all their systems are now covered (mind you not all games from the older systems, but they are trying). playstation on the other hand is still getting you to double and triple dip on games nintendo style. their idea of backwards compatibility was the PSnow crap... it was good when it first came out, heck it was even on my sony bluray player so i didn't need to have my PS3 hooked up to the same tv to play games. but then they stripped that feature... xbox also has true 4K where playstation pro is upscaled and very noticable. and before anyone tries to say i'm talking out of my ass... i own both an XBO-X and a pro and i see it. the only thing i see going for playstation right now is the VR. but i'm sure xbox will have the oculus in some form on the system by the end of it's lifetime.",,peytonpeanut2017,Canada,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

In hindsight, I could have asked the question a little less harsh, and that's my bad. I apologize to the people of GS. Regarding your reply though, the topic wasn't about an old game or an old issue. It's still relevant as it was about PSNOW, which is a feature that not only still exists, it's bigger than it was when the thread was originally created. I can for sure understand why no one would want a topic about something completely outdated to be bumped, but this was something that people still use to this day. I wouldn't post on an old thread about something irrelevant, like someone having issues with a 3 year old game. If it's about something that is still currently being used, and is still pertinent though, I just don't see the issue. Id rather fish through old comments on an old thread than see the message board get filled up with the same conversation over and over. It also threw me off because if you Google: ""Why does PSNOW constantly close?"" the thread is literally the first link. Naturally I was drawn to it which is how I ended up on GS. To be completely honest, I didn't even really look at the dates, as I assumed the first link from Google would be something you could still talk about as the reply button was still active. I figured if the conversation was over, they would have locked it. Once I posted, people were replying again and the conversation got started back up until someone mentioned a necro-thread and it got locked. If users are expected to see if the thread is old or using the search option to see the topic has come up many times, why can they not be expected to see that even though it's an old thread, people are talking about it again? I just didn't want to start another thread about the same topic, so I posted on the one that was already there and still open. I figured the place where people were discussing the issue would be the place to discuss the issue, y'know? I'm obviously new to GS, so I wasn't familiar with the etiquette, tbh. I just wanted to talk about the matter at hand with the people who were talking about it before. Thank you for filling me in, though. Much appreciated.

If it was as simple as they think this idea would have been here 11 years ago when I first tried it out on some service that eventually bit the dust. Playstation Now can't even do it well on the computer and they have the infrastructure. The games have huge input lag and stream in low quality. You need fiber pipes with like minimum 15 Mbps download constantly for 1080p streaming per user. They're getting closer with specialized processing and hardware that can anticipate future frames, but then that requires the user to have an actual piece of hardware (like you said). Have these people even tried a Steam Link? Valve made an optimized piece of hardware to stream LOCALLY and it still has huge input delay and choppy streaming over WiFi.

What honestly would they have to lose releasing say ""super SMASH Bros"" for XBOX and PS4? Or Super Mario Galaxy in 4k? These games would probably be as big as games like Halo and God of War. I would have no doubt. I understand their commitment of protecting their games, but they could still do their portables (including Switch) and I think they would still be making as much money as they are now, and arguably, more money. I know this leaves a dirty taste in Nintendo fans mouths, but I just think of the possibilities of what they could do finally joining forces with their long time competition. A universal console where we can play Halo, Zelda, Mario bros and God of war in 4K, online, all in the same day and on the same console. Hey, I can dream can't I? And I'm a HUGE Nintendo guy, have been since day one. Until then, I'll cherish my Wii U, and Switch. And maybe, just maybe, wait for the inevitable. I will take criticism as I expect to get some bringing this up again. But I would like the real reasons why this would be bad for Nintendo or bad for gamers? Or could it just be a positive thing? ====================::==================== gencid said: ↑ I think the future of videogames will be a streaming / download / digital only service. As such, yes, we will likely play Nintendo on 3rd party hardware in the future, alongside Sony's and MS's 1st party, 15-20 years from now. You can play Sega and Atari games on Amazon Fire TV today. I am sure starting with MS's GamePass, then PlayStation Now and finally Nintendo Entertainment System, everyone will eventually be primarily invested in a service business with a hardware option on the side.

As DSoup says, all that heat in one place means additional cooling costs that are mitigated when the processing is spread out across everyone's homes. You ought be looking at approximately the same amount of energy to run the games at the same node tech. And the internet backbone to shift all that data won't be insignificant in power demands. For multiplayer gaming, cloud computing may be more efficient as you have to run a lot of the same hardware anyways, although peer-to-peer over the internet is still much less data than video streaming to all the players. Click to expand... You'll need to do point to point comparisons here to be fair. You're associating the cost of building infrastructure for several industries/governments vs a single client. To accept a download you must own a console. It's not the case with streaming, you can stream to more devices, thus your environmental impact should be lower provided they don't need to walk out and buy a console to download the game. Perhaps they can use their phone/tablet/laptop or older console instead. ====================::==================== Shifty Geezer said: ↑ I'm not talking money costs but energy. Whether you're building servers for government or gaming, you have to build those servers the same as building consoles. If you're going to consider the cost (energy) to build and transport consoles to users homes, you also need to consider the cost to build and transport the servers. I'm avoiding the cost of infrastructure in both cases. I assume the internet is there for both. However, every transaction over that internet has an energy cost, so the more data you are transferring, the higher the costs. For downloads, that's the cost of transferring the game. For streaming, that's the cost of playing the game. There are cases where either is clearly the more optimal. Downloading 100 GB to play a 6 hour single-player adventure is going to cost more internet energy than streaming 6 hours of the game at 5 GB/hour HD video, whereas downloading 100 GB to play 2000 hours of Destiny (you know who you are!) is clearly more efficient than streaming 2000 hours of Destiny at 5 GB/h. I notice I stupidly missed the console power cost though. Edited. Click to expand... Yea some titles it's not advantageous to do entirely everything through streaming as you provided examples. But i suspect those individuals are few (Destiny streaming players). I see streaming as a supplement to gaming at home. So game at home, and take it on the road with you by streaming. But I suppose there will be individuals who are more comfortable streaming than buying into an ecosystem. With little knowledge of how streaming yet is priced/cost, and what the library is (if your own library or a set library like PSNow) it's hard to tell.",,iroboto,Germany,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Streaming Games from the Cloud 5,,,

Not trophy boosting, no server worries, just single player games which I would eventually 100% complete and platinum. Played some awesome games so far and recently went through the Yakuza trilogy (Zero, Kiwami and Kiwami2). So could you guys recommend some awesome single player only games. Either disc based or digital is fine just as long as I can 100% them on my own. I've played tonnes of games over the years so not missing out by having a specific profile like this if thats what you think, and I still have my other profile for online gaming with pals. There will be the obvious choices which will get named a few times and thats fine, because that shows what awesome games they are. Also. I'm not doing this for quick and easy to build up some kind of competitive profile. Its just a single player only profile which gives me awesome games to play. A few I want to consider. Vampyr. Is this any good? I know it has a select following and people rave about the story but dislike the combat mechanics. Should this game be bought when its on sale rather than paying full whack? Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2. These were nice games back on orginal release and I can't remember most of what went on. But does a splash of paint for remastered visuals mean anything if the game feels old and clunky to play? Are there any racing games (more towards realistic vehicles rather than goofy cartoon stuff)? Wish they made Elite single player only completion as that would have been amazing. Top game but has online crap that I can't be bothered with. Anyhoo. Suggestions please. ====================::==================== ill just recommend most if not all of what i have that single player only. i recommend them all, they're great fun. do you care about DLC? some of these might have DLC trophies. i only own a PS4, i played all these games on their PS4 releases or through PSNow on my PS4. Darksiders 1, 2, and 3. little bit of zelda, little bit of GoW, little bit of Souls, all round a great series, play the remastered versions of 1 and 2, 3 is pretty new. God of War games, for obvious reasons. classic game series. (ascension technically has one trophy linked to its multiplayer mode, but all you have to do is complete the tutorial which can be done solo) Infamous 1, 2, Second Son. really fun open world series with a great story and really fun gameplay. (2 has trophies linked to user generated missions, but they can be done solo as well) Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian. cannot recommend these enough, incredible and beautiful games all made by my favorite game devs of all time. Shadow of the Colossus is the best of the 3 by far. Dishonored 1 and 2. Stealth based gameplay is one of my favorites, and these games do it right. the same developer also made... Prey. i was completely surprised by how good this game was. absolutely amazing sci fi story, with about a billion different ways to do everything. Horizon Zero Dawn. another impressive new IP that emerged. the creature design in this game really wins it for me, so creative and cool. Kingdom Hearts. all of it. the series holds a special place in my heart, but i truly believe they are great games even without the nostalgia. the developer Telltale games makes great visual-novel style games, if you're into that choose-your-own-adventure style. South Park: The Stick of Truth and Fractured But Whole. if you like south parks brand of humor anyway. if not, then maybe avoid these lol Spider-Man. what more needs to be said? Spidey has always been the best superhero to play in video games. The Order: 1886. VERY short but decent. can be found cheap. Far Cry Primal. animal companions in this are fun. never played other FC games but this caveman one is good RE7. if you like horror games. Nioh. guide says some of the trophies require an internet connection, but i think its just so the game can update the missions that change. Soulsborne series. these games have multiplayer functions kinda laced through them, so if you want to avoid them i understand. pretty sure you can play in offline mode and plat them though. correct me if im wrong. Mirror's Edge Catalyst. excellent parkour gameplay. again, user generated content trophies. Asura's Wrath. very over the top anime style storytelling. heavy action. super fun. the recent remasters of classic ps1 and ps2 titles are also great choices. personally i picked up the Jak and Daxter series and the Spyro trilogy. wow. uhhh, sorry. that turned into a lot.

For the past year I have been sorely disappointed with the choice of games in Playstation Now, it's almost like Sony is literally cherry picking games to put on their list. Personally I see no point in streaming PS4 games on Playstation Now, it's better to just buy a physical version or download a game straight to your harddrive with no hassles. But the service is overall good for those who don't own a Playstation 3. There are a number of games that aren't on Playstation Now and because of how the Playstation 3 was designed, that was perhaps why Sony didn't make the PS4 backwards compatible. This is the big factor for what is going to determine whether or not I will buy a Playstation 5. I don't like the direction video games have taken these past two years, and I'm starting to believe selling a game on graphics alone is a bigger, more appealing feature than just selling a game on gameplay, which has been done for generations. I also feel that innovations in gameplay have plateaued, because video game companies who produce and make these AAA games are going to try to make them closer to looking like real life. I think re-releasing these older titles from the Playstation 2 generation onwards for the next console generation with modern support and trophy lists is a great thing. A jack of all trades sort of deal. But for this year I'm still continuing to buy Playstation 3 games and Vita games because I never got around to them years ago back when they were released. I guess the question is what will the Playstation 5 generation present to us. This could be the first time in my life that I'm not really excited or looking forward to the next generation. Right now we have countless games we can buy off of PSN and if you play on Steam or Nintendo's Switch there are nearly unlimited opportunities to play and enjoy them. To me that is good enough. What do you guys think? ====================::==================== I still have 2 ps4pro, 2 ps3 and 3 psvita",,iPro-PS,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Working with multiple Sony consoles...,,,

We have a parrot in the room? You didn't dispute a single one of his points. 100+ High quality games, of varied genres..... vs 2 Third Person action games and a VR platformer? (Which lets be honest, people probably know less about this game than VR chat... which is probably more liked) Damn.... 3 games in limited genres are worth more than 100 now... only in cows minds. And that's only via technicalities. He's telling me Monster Hunter on PC doesn't count. But Monster Hunter on PS4 counts. Because of a 2-3 point gap due to magazine padding at MC. Same goes for Forza, Witcher 3 Blood and Whine, XCOM2, and about 20 other games. This is why I use GS as well, GS intelligently normalizes this. He's being disingenuous when only counting 9+ at MC due to this reason. Something we have NEVER done. They literally started this due to my posts showing how good PC was doing. All in all to tie this with the OP, I am NOT surprised PC has the most developers. It has the most sheer volume of releases and this contributes to massive amount of high scoring titles. It also contributes to a lot of junk, but we all have the option to easily not play them. You mean... Witcher: Blood and Wine is superior on PS4 because MAGAZINES TOLD ME!!!! IT MUST BE TRUE! Don't forget. -1 AAAE for PS4, because Bloodborne is now playable on any device that can use PSNOW.

What honestly would they have to lose releasing say ""super SMASH Bros"" for XBOX and PS4? Or Super Mario Galaxy in 4k? These games would probably be as big as games like Halo and God of War. I would have no doubt. I understand their commitment of protecting their games, but they could still do their portables (including Switch) and I think they would still be making as much money as they are now, and arguably, more money. I know this leaves a dirty taste in Nintendo fans mouths, but I just think of the possibilities of what they could do finally joining forces with their long time competition. A universal console where we can play Halo, Zelda, Mario bros and God of war in 4K, online, all in the same day and on the same console. Hey, I can dream can't I? And I'm a HUGE Nintendo guy, have been since day one. Until then, I'll cherish my Wii U, and Switch. And maybe, just maybe, wait for the inevitable. I will take criticism as I expect to get some bringing this up again. But I would like the real reasons why this would be bad for Nintendo or bad for gamers?

182234716513,1/22/2019,http://officialsmartphoneblog.tumblr.com/post/182234716513,"Update 1/22/19: After three months of beta testing, Google’s Project Stream test is over. The beta test officially ended on January 15th. We haven’t heard anything about the free copy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey for gamers who logged over an hour in the game.

Streaming video games is yet another cool trend of 2018. We’ve seen big-name services like NVIDIA GeForce and PlayStation Now do it, and now it looks like Google is trying to get into that business with Project Stream. Starting October 5th, some lucky people can test playing Assassin’s Creed Odyssey right in Google Chrome without needing a high-end PC. The way Project Stream works is that it streams gameplay from a computer in the cloud while your PC sends the keyboard and mouse commands. Conceptually, this is nothing new, but Google promises extremely low latency and high-fidelity graphics.

Google has partnered with Ubisoft to make Assassin’s Creed Odyssey the first playable game via Project Stream. Selected participants in this initial beta program will not have to pay anything to test the game. It’s clear that Google is still testing the technology, so making the game free-to-play for participants will help them collect useful data. You can watch a gameplay demo of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey being played through Google Chrome below.

While this sounds really exciting, it, of course, has some limitations. First, it is currently only open for U.S. residents. This may be because the service is still in beta, so we don’t think Google will keep it limited to the United States when the service is eventually released. Second, you have to be 17 years old or older to participate. Third, you’ll need an Internet connection capable of at least 25 megabits per second. Lastly, you’ll need a desktop or laptop PC with access to the desktop version of Google Chrome, such as any PC running Windows 10, macOS, or Linux, or a Chromebook running Chrome OS.

It's getting high praise and is a ground up remake of that awesome game you once loved. You are who this game is for. Click to expand... I just hate Xbox and PlayStation now. I get so tired of deleting games because each disc is DRM since I'm downloading the damn game anyway. It just turns me off every time I buy a game. I was kind of considering it previously but I went to go play Dead Space on Xbox One and I had to delete games to install a 360 game... and then I was just disheartened by the whole experience all over again. Click to expand... Idk man that's a pretty small thing overall to just skip out on great games over. Click to expand... Really, I'm not huge on modern games, though. All the games people are creaming themselves over I think are just kind of 'meh'. I have a Switch but you can definitely argue it's targeted towards the retro minded. This one interests me because I enjoyed this game back like... what, 20 years ago? As far as PC gaming, I used to use Steam a lot. My laptop is pretty decent and I haven't really had any problems playing a game when I decide to boot one up but I rarely break that out. My desktop is strictly for music now and I have that upstairs in a room no one goes in. I dunno, where I'm at with family, work, etc... it's hard to sit down and just devote tons of time at once to games. Switch is nice because it's on the go, Atari is nice because it's like 15 minute bursts, etc... I've considered getting an external hard drive strictly for my Xbox but then I feel like I'm getting into the PC gaming realm where I have to get upgrades and move on to new things and just damn... I want my console so I pop the game in and just play. Nice, quick, and easy. Consoles have left that. The night I got my Xbox One I was so disappointed when I popped Injustice 2 in and I had to download... and I wasn't able to play my console until the next day. You guys can say it's petty or stupid reasons, that's fine. I get where you're coming from. I think I've just gotten to the point where modern stuff just isn't for me anymore. And it takes a really special game to bring me back into the fold. And, funny enough again, Cuphead is what inspired me to get an Xbox One. And yeah, I could have gotten that on PC, too.",,wii-60 (invalid@example.com),United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,Played RE2 demo for 3 minutes and turned it off,,,

I don't care if you're playing any MS game on the PC, soon Sony will be doing the same and have actually already started. Your laughter is just to mask the pain and butthurt you feel inside caused by the X1X. Your console of choice no longer has the best versions of multiplats. It's now fffaaaaarrrrrrr behind the X1X for console exclusives and in a distant 3rd for all other multiplats. Sucks to be you So the X1 is now free? You know, since they have to cut retail allllll the time as you say. I guess when Sony cuts their price they're desperate as well. Good to know and I'll be sure to remind you of that when Sony cuts the price again. The pain! The agonizing pain not wanting to buy Microsoft's $500 box with a shitty CPU that still plays most games at 30 fps! The jealousy BURNS! You don't understand, the PC is my multiplat machine (sans sports titles) and if Sony made the move to PC, then I have no need for a Playstation. See how that works? I'm not going to be impressed by a console anymore when I have a machine that I can customize at my own leisure that will give me a better experience with the games? Xbox so far is the only console with its games running natively on PC, therefore, Xbox One is useless to me. Thought you said it was cheap now? Massive price cuts right? Oh and it still plays every single multiplat better than it's $400 weaker counter part. Ohhh the butthurt and massive pain this has caused you personally. That much is obvious but at least you can admit it. Oh I understand, you're hiding behind the PC as all cows do. It's nothing new just pathetic is all. BTW Sony has already started the move to PC. Only a matter of time before they start releasing new titles on PSNow same day and date as the console. Maury has checked the results and determined.........................that was a lie. You're always impressive by the incredibly weak PS4, going by your posting history so you hiding behind your PC is a classic cow move. Another false statement.

You can actually go full aggro on any of the games I think (need to play Demon's Souls too). Shields are useful in DS1 but not really needed at all once you know the enemies. Hell, Giant Dad is actually BUILT around a two-handed weapon that doesn't have the stats to one hand (it's a PvP build but still pretty fun for PvE). But I see what you are saying. The speed and aggressiveness of Bloodborne's enemies is definitely in some of DS3's enemies, but if I remember correctly, wasn't the PC in Bloodborne faster too?

What honestly would they have to lose releasing say ""super SMASH Bros"" for XBOX and PS4? Or Super Mario Galaxy in 4k? These games would probably be as big as games like Halo and God of War. I would have no doubt. I understand their commitment of protecting their games, but they could still do their portables (including Switch) and I think they would still be making as much money as they are now, and arguably, more money. I know this leaves a dirty taste in Nintendo fans mouths, but I just think of the possibilities of what they could do finally joining forces with their long time competition. A universal console where we can play Halo, Zelda, Mario bros and God of war in 4K, online, all in the same day and on the same console. Hey, I can dream can't I? And I'm a HUGE Nintendo guy, have been since day one. Until then, I'll cherish my Wii U, and Switch. And maybe, just maybe, wait for the inevitable. I will take criticism as I expect to get some bringing this up again. But I would like the real reasons why this would be bad for Nintendo or bad for gamers? Or could it just be a positive thing? ====================::==================== gencid said: ↑ I think the future of videogames will be a streaming / download / digital only service. As such, yes, we will likely play Nintendo on 3rd party hardware in the future, alongside Sony's and MS's 1st party, 15-20 years from now. You can play Sega and Atari games on Amazon Fire TV today. I am sure starting with MS's GamePass, then PlayStation Now and finally Nintendo Entertainment System, everyone will eventually be primarily invested in a service business with a hardware option on the side.

Do you think we could see the cloud service come to the west in 2019 or 2020, and what games do you think we'll see, and what games would you like to see? ====================::==================== Nintendo doesn’t have their own “cloud service” Resident Evil 7 and Assassins Creed Odyssey simply connected the Switch to cloud server systems in Japan that Capcom and Ubisoft essentially lease to run their games through the cloud. Sony cloud streaming comes from them buying out failing cloud streaming services OnLive/Gaikai over a decade ago, which is what they now run PsNow through Microsoft is creating their own cloud game streaming platform, Project xCloud, which is launching next year on their systems and pc and every mobile device known to man lol to run gamepass games through. Nvidia is creating their own cloud service streaming platform to run 3rd party games. (I doubt they are teaming up with Nintendo to create a platform on Switch...but who knows?) Google is teaming up with Ubisoft to create an open source cloud streaming service platform for publishers to use. But yea, I fully expect to see more and more console games streaming modern elite pc gaming graphics games on Switch machines this year and definitely beyond (and on old laptops and iPads and smartphones lol) That’s the future of mass videogaming, and while Nintendo usually does drag their feet on that type of thing, I think they will be proactive in this area seeing that their market is console gaming on a portable...they will have to include cloud streaming games to keep up with every other portable device that is going to offer it. Eventually, AAA multiplats on the Switch will have graphical parity to PC’s...so the debate about hardware power will become irrelevant. It already started happening on the Switch last year, I expect it only to increase exponentially going forward.",,phantomx,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,When/If do you think Nintendo will bring their cloud service to the west?

Not trophy boosting, no server worries, just single player games which I would eventually 100% complete and platinum. Played some awesome games so far and recently went through the Yakuza trilogy (Zero, Kiwami and Kiwami2). So could you guys recommend some awesome single player only games. Either disc based or digital is fine just as long as I can 100% them on my own. I've played tonnes of games over the years so not missing out by having a specific profile like this if thats what you think, and I still have my other profile for online gaming with pals. There will be the obvious choices which will get named a few times and thats fine, because that shows what awesome games they are. Also. I'm not doing this for quick and easy to build up some kind of competitive profile. Its just a single player only profile which gives me awesome games to play. A few I want to consider. Vampyr. Is this any good? I know it has a select following and people rave about the story but dislike the combat mechanics. Should this game be bought when its on sale rather than paying full whack? Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2. These were nice games back on orginal release and I can't remember most of what went on. But does a splash of paint for remastered visuals mean anything if the game feels old and clunky to play? Are there any racing games (more towards realistic vehicles rather than goofy cartoon stuff)? Wish they made Elite single player only completion as that would have been amazing. Top game but has online crap that I can't be bothered with. Anyhoo. Suggestions please. ====================::==================== ill just throw out most, if not all, of what i have that is single player only. i recommend them all, they're great fun. do you care about DLC? some of these might have DLC trophies. i only own a PS4, i played all these games on their PS4 releases or through PSNow on my PS4. Darksiders 1, 2, and 3. little bit of zelda, little bit of GoW, little bit of Souls, all round a great series, play the remastered versions of 1 and 2, 3 is pretty new. God of War games, for obvious reasons. classic game series. (ascension technically has one trophy linked to its multiplayer mode, but all you have to do is complete the tutorial which can be done solo) Infamous 1, 2, and Second Son. really fun open world series with a great story and really fun gameplay. (2 has trophies linked to user generated missions, but they can be done solo as well) Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian. cannot recommend these enough, incredible and beautiful games all made by my favorite game devs of all time. Shadow of the Colossus is the best of the 3 by far. Dishonored 1 and 2. Stealth based gameplay is one of my favorites, and these games do it right. the same developer also made... Prey. i was completely surprised by how good this game was. absolutely amazing sci fi story, with about a billion different ways to do everything. Horizon Zero Dawn. another impressive new IP that emerged. the creature design in this game really wins it for me, so creative and cool. Kingdom Hearts. all of it. the series holds a special place in my heart, but i truly believe they are great games even without the nostalgia. the developer Telltale games m̶a̶k̶e̶s̶ made great visual-novel style games, if you're into that choose-your-own-adventure stuff. ive played Game of Thrones, Tales From the Borderlands, and Walking Dead South Park: The Stick of Truth and Fractured But Whole. if you like south parks brand of humor anyway. if not, then maybe avoid these lol Spider-Man. what more needs to be said? Spidey has always been the best superhero to play in video games. The Order: 1886. VERY short but decent. can be found cheap. Far Cry Primal. animal companions in this are fun. never played other FC games but this caveman one is good Resident Evil 7. if you like horror games, this a new take on a classic series. Nioh. guide says some of the trophies require an internet connection, but i think its just so the game can update the missions that change. Soulsborne series. these games have multiplayer functions kinda laced through them, so if you want to avoid them i understand. pretty sure you can play in offline mode and plat them though. correct me if im wrong. Mirror's Edge Catalyst. excellent parkour gameplay. very smooth, and decent graphics. (again, user generated content trophies.) Asura's Wrath. very over the top anime style storytelling. heavy action. super fun. the recent remasters of classic ps1 and ps2 titles are also great choices. personally i picked up the Jak and Daxter series and the Spyro trilogy. wow. uhhh, sorry. that turned into a lot.

182192271923,1/21/2019,http://moralessylvia.tumblr.com/post/182192271923,"Given huge mobile gaming market, 5G and cloud could provide a big boost to on-the-go gamers

Spurred by mega-hit games like Fortnite and PUBG, mobile gaming is quickly becoming a massive market that operators and the telecoms ecosystem at large can not only support but also monetize. According to analysis compiled by Nielson company SuperData, in 2018 mobile platform gaming hit a $63.1 billion market value. Given the throughput and latency needs of creating a mobile gaming experience comparable to a console-based experience, the combination of 5G and edge compute can support continued growth in this valuable segment.

During the the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month in Las Vegas, Nevada, Intel demonstrated a cloud gaming experience running over a commercial 5G network set up inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.

Intel’s Jonathan Wood, senior director, Systems Architecture and Client Group, and general manager of business development for advanced technology, told RCR Wireless News, “We’re trying to show CES visitors what 5G is capable of. One of the great things we have in terms of new use cases is really providing high quality gaming on devices you would traditionally see on the high street.”

In the demo, a live 5G network connected to an Intel 2-in-1 to support Rise of the Tomb Raider. “We’re not talking high-end PCs here and gaming machines,” Wood said. “We’re talking very straight forward PCs. The way we do that is we that we’re actually bringing that compute closer to the device using low latency. We can rely on that computing to take place on the edge of the network, not necessarily on the device, and that provides fantastic graphics experience for our users. When we look at this cloud gaming use case where we’re having the gaming take place on an edge server, doing all the hard compute and hard processing, that makes life a lot easier for everybody.”

Here’s a video of the demo along with commentary from Wood.



Wood extended the paradigm of combining 5G and edge computing for cloud gaming to other use cases that would serve the interests of enterprise and industrial users, including facial recognition, AI and associated workflows and industrial robotics. “If we can do that at the edge of the network, that kind of changes the kind of devices we see. We can actually provide that compute very, very close to where the application is being consumed.”

From the operator perspective, The Verge recently broke a story that Verizon is testing a “Netflix-style cloud gaming service.” According to the report, “Verizon Gaming is already up and running on the Nvidia Shield set-top box and will, according to the company’s documentation, eventually make its way to Android smartphones.”

The Verge further reports: “For Verizon, cloud gaming could be a showcase for 5G broadband both in the home and on the go. The low latency and fast data speeds of 5G could solve for many of the hurdles that game streaming apps — such as Sony’s PlayStation Now — are dealing with today.”

“We work very closely with [the operator]ecosystem,” Wood said. “Intel actually provides an end-to-end capability. 5G is all about data. We’re working with them very closely to ensure they build out the capabilities within those networks so they can really take advantage of these new types of services. The wireless piece is a real significant game-changer with the low latency, but when you’re adding in all the other elements to this with the improvements and enhancements to compute, then you really have a complete end-to-end network, which is ready for primetime with 5G.”

Maybe it ends the gay choices back in? Not sure. It was so jangled that I played it once and forgot it to be honest. That's fine tho. KOTOR 1 is complete on it's own. Fucl the second and scrapped third. Lol Unfortunately DAO is ps3 or pc and not on psnow. That being said, KOTOR you can get on your mobile device! Haha. Got it for free from Amazon underground.

The company has been trying to reduce its reliance on the all-important iPhone business, which has arguably peaked at this point. Instead, the tech titan has been building up its services segment, which is more profitable and generates consistent recurring revenue.

Apple isn’t the only one.

Creating the “Netflix of games”

Cheddar reports that Apple is working on a gaming service that would be a sort of “Netflix for games,” allowing users to access a catalog of games for a subscription fee. The Mac maker reportedly discussed the notion with game developers late last year. Apple has even considered becoming a publisher, according to Cheddar. In the video game industry, a publisher typically takes on marketing and distribution while also often providing financial backing.

If Apple were to take on that role, it could try to finance exclusive titles only available on iOS as a means of differentiation. The vast majority of mobile games are cross-platform compatible, as developers look for the broadest distribution. Android is the largest mobile platform, but iOS generally offers much stronger monetization. It’s also worth noting that games make up an overwhelming proportion of overall spending on the App Store, representing a massive 75% of consumer spending despite accounting for just 31% of downloads in 2017, according to App Annie.

Nothing appears to be finalized and Apple could ditch the plan altogether.

Everybody’s doing it

The news comes shortly after Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella detailed a game service that the software giant is working on, except Microsoft wants to stream games to devices. The company had announced ""Project xCloud"" in October, and Microsoft would leverage its Azure cloud computing platform to deliver console-quality games to any device. “We describe it as, shorthand, ‘Netflix for games,’” Nadella said earlier this month. Microsoft plans to start testing the service later this year.





Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is similarly developing a game-streaming service, according to The Information, but it isn’t expected to launch until 2020. The e-commerce giant has the largest cloud computing platform in the world (AWS), as well as one of the largest video game live-streaming platforms (Twitch). Amazon has active job listings for software engineers to work on cloud games. Alphabet subsidiary Google is also working on a cloud gaming service.

Sony (NYSE: SNE) was an early pioneer with PlayStation Now, a game-streaming service that launched in 2015. However, PlayStation Now’s technical performance is lacking, and the service hasn’t really moved the needle for Sony or the industry. Sony also offers PlayStation Plus, a subscription that also includes access to a catalog of free and discounted games.

Apple’s rumored service doesn’t seem to have a streaming component, so presumably users would still need to download any included titles. While that model would differ, it would still compete with other subscription-based game services. Whether Apple can make the economics work remains to be seen.

182190085495,1/21/2019,http://engadget-in-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/182190085495,"Streaming detonated the film and television industries. As recently as five years ago, the advent of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube Premium sounded the death knell for multi-billion dollar businesses, altered the living-room habits of millions of people, and changed studio production structures permanently. Companies that adapted survived, and the viewing audience received a handful of clear benefits in return – most notably the ability to watch high-quality shows and movies on demand and, most recently, an explosion of award-winning, culturally transformative entertainment options.

Now, it’s video games’ turn. The idea of a “Netflix for games” service has been floating around since long before video-streaming became a thing, but it hasn’t found a solid foothold quite yet. Streaming games is a more complicated process than streaming video, since it adds user input to the mix. While being piped into a player’s home or phone from a server that could be hundreds of miles away, the game has to respond, without lag, to every button press a player makes. Think Bandersnatch on steroids and with much higher stakes, especially for competitive games like Fortnite and multiplayer Call of Duty and Overwatch.





The technology and infrastructure necessary for consumer-scale, seamless game-streaming is nearly here. NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Verizon and more major companies are making moves in this space, and they finally have the server dispersion and broadband support necessary to roll out their own Netflix-style services as early as this year.

Streaming will alter the video game industry just like it did film and TV. On top of further disrupting the flailing physical market (GameStop might just be the Blockbuster of the game-streaming apocalypse), distributors will likely hold an inordinate amount of power over a game’s visibility, pushing it onto the main screen or pulling it into the recesses of the search bar based on unknowable algorithmic variables. If each platform becomes as crowded as Steam or the App Store (or Netflix, for that matter), this means smaller, independent games could find it difficult to grab screen time. Low visibility doesn’t just impact potential revenue – projected sales affect how much funding developers can secure from investors, as described by gamesindustry.biz.

But at this point, nothing is going to stop the cloud-gaming train. As it comes screeching into the station in 2019, here’s where eight major companies stand.





Verizon

Here’s one fresh off the rumor mill: Verizon is currently quietly testing a game-streaming service called Verizon Gaming, as first reported by The Verge earlier in January. Verizon is apparently testing the service on a handful of NVIDIA Shield set-top boxes; the alpha version includes 135 games, including AAA hits like Destiny 2, Red Dead Redemption 2, Fortnite and God of War. Participants are reportedly promised a $150 Amazon gift card, alongside receiving a Shield and Xbox One controller.

The plan, according to Verge, is to eventually roll out Verizon Gaming on Android devices. The company hasn’t officially announced Verizon Gaming, but it’s openly building the infrastructure to support such a system. Verizon is making a big push for 5G, the next-generation broadband network that will likely enable average connection speeds of 300 Mbps. Note that Google’s cloud-gaming test required a connection of 25 Mbps, at least.

“We frequently conduct internal and external proof-of-concept trials to explore new ways to enrich the customer experience and expand our portfolio of products and services,” a Verizon spokesperson told Engadget.





Google

Speaking of Google, the company recently held a beta test for Project Stream, a service that promises to run any game on any laptop or PC via the Chrome browser. It required a connection of 25 Mbps, but even at that low end of the broadband spectrum, Project Stream worked well. The beta went live in October and Google wasn’t shy about enticing people to give it a go.

Google has a clear advantage in the streaming space with a vast and robust server infrastructure, and it already has streaming devices in tens of millions of houses with Chromecast.

We learned at CES 2019 that Project Stream uses AMD Radeon graphics (no word on whether that means the coming Radeon VII), rather than any of NVIDIA’s offerings. Which brings us to Geforce Now.





NVIDIA

Geforce Now is the closest thing we have to a subscription-based, consumer-ready game-streaming service, and it’s been running for the past three years. However, it’s been in beta the entire time (currently available on PC, Mac and Shield devices), and the company hasn’t made any announcements about a wide-scale launch. However, Geforce Now is impressive. It supports more than 400 games and generally offers a stutter-free gaming experience.

The company is continually updating Geforce Now alongside Shield upgrades, recently adding support for in-game voice chat and streamlined Twitch sharing.





Amazon

Amazon already has a footprint in a slightly different game-streaming space: Twitch. Amazon bought Twitch for nearly $1 billion in 2014, and since then it’s grown into a cultural touchstone, hosting celebrities, taking over mainstream headlines, and helping turn live-streaming into a lucrative career for some creators. Add this acumen and brand recognition to Amazon’s Fire TV efforts and Lumberyard game engine, and the company has a clear spot in the cloud-gaming race.

Amazon is building a game-streaming service a la Project Stream, though it’s unlikely to launch before 2020, according to The Information. That’s about all we know so far, and Amazon didn’t respond to Engadget’s request for comment.





Microsoft

The house of Xbox announced Project xCloud in October, with an emphasis on streaming games to PCs, phones and tablets. However, that’s surely not where Microsoft’s ambition ends – the next generation of consoles is on its way and Xbox is reportedly working on hardware designed specifically to support cloud gaming, due out in 2020.

Project xCloud hasn’t launched just yet, but Microsoft is planning a beta test this year. Microsoft is in a similar position as Google – it’s spent the past decade or so building out Azure, a robust cloud network that should help keep latency low. Plus, there’s the Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft is preparing its audience for a subscription-based future, offering access to more than 200 games for $10 a month, though unlike PlayStation Now, these aren’t streamed.

After Sony pulled out of E3 2019 completely, Xbox is poised to own the show this summer (and maybe even the next hardware generation entirely), and it may offer more details about its streaming plans then.





Sony

Sony was an early adopter in the cloud renaissance, buying Gaikai in 2012 and OnLive in 2015, and launching the PlayStation Now game-streaming service in 2014. PlayStation Now is still running today, but it offers subpar streaming capabilities. It’s more of a case study in how streaming used to be, rather than where it’s going.

Sony hasn’t made any recent announcements about its approach to streaming and it won’t be at E3 this year. Of course, there are still plans for the future of PlayStation and executives promise we’ll hear more throughout 2019.

Electronic Arts

EA isn’t building a cloud-gaming platform, but it is working on the technology that could power a streaming-first ecosystem. Project Atlas is EA’s upcoming cloud-gaming-development platform, and it’s designed to help creators build games from the ground-up with streaming in mind.

This move makes sense for EA. It owns the Frostbite engine, which currently powers franchises such as Dragon Age, FIFA, Madden and Battlefield, and it runs the digital Origin store, which features monthly subscription options. EA bought GameFly’s cloud-gaming technology and personnel in mid-2018 (not its streaming business, mind), and by October, CTO Ken Moss had announced Project Atlas.

EA’s vision of cloud gaming involves creating a social, constantly connected universe where developers can craft personalized and immersive experiences for players, all driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Moss has ambitious goals for Project Atlas, as he described in a Medium post:
EA’s vision of cloud gaming involves creating a social, constantly connected universe.
“Project Atlas is designed to seamlessly converge EA’s Frostbite game engine and game services as well as artificial intelligence  – giving rise to a new game development platform, optimized for a cloud-enabled world. This will be a fully integrated platform, capable of building the scalable, social, and large-scale experiences of the future.”

Nintendo

Yes, Nintendo – the company that was yearsbehind the competition when it came to implementing online and social features in its games and consoles – is experimenting with streaming. Players in Japan can stream Resident Evil 7 and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on the Switch right now, with shockinglygood results.",,engadget-in-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Who will be the first Netflix for video games?,Post,,

It's a long article so I am including the main stuff. Feel free to read the original linked above. This should be fun discussion. Let's discuss. ""With the PlayStation 2 in 2000, Sony dominated the video game market; Microsoft's original Xbox was barely a competitor. But with the PlayStation 3 in 2006, Sony lost its dominance in the video game market. Microsoft's Xbox 360 became the standard-bearer for video game consoles of its generation, and it remained that way until 2013 when Sony and Microsoft launched the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively. With the PlayStation 4, Sony is back on top. Microsoft's Xbox One is doing fine, just like the PlayStation 3 did, but it's a distant second place to Sony's PS4. And now, the game of musical chairs has begun once again, with rumors swirling and even some outright official talk from both Sony and Microsoft about their next generation of game consoles."" ""With such a huge lead, it's Sony's game to lose — and there are some worrying signs that Sony's repeating the same mistakes Microsoft did when it introduced the Xbox One."" Regarding Cross Play: "" After months of back and forth, with Sony repeatedly offering bad excuses to fans for not allowing cross-play, the company finally relented in September 2018. More than just upsetting fans, Sony's refusal to allow cross-play sparked some major game publishers to speak out. Sony — a company that enjoyed years of good will with gamers following the launch of the PS4 — started looking like the arrogant one. It was reminiscent of Microsoft's messaging around the launch of the Xbox One, which often felt like Microsoft wasn't listening to its most loyal fans."" ""Microsoft introduced a video game console that wasn't focused on video games. The company demonstrated repeatedly that it wasn't listening to its most core consumers, and in doing so lost a lot of early momentum. ""And now Sony is showing early signs of making those same mistakes."" ""In a New York Times interview ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in early January, Sony Corporation CEO Kenichiro Yoshida laid out his plans for integrating the enormously popular PlayStation Network — the digital backbone of the PlayStation consoles — with Sony's music and movie businesses."" ""While PlayStation Network could be expanded into an ""entertainment"" service, it shouldn't be. Core gaming audiences have repeatedly demonstrated their lack of interest in gaming platforms being broadened. Look no further than Microsoft's announcement of the Xbox One — the focus on television, sports, and ""smart"" functionality was a perfect trifecta of bad press for the console."" Some of that had to do with Microsoft's Xbox leadership at the time, which was going through a lot of changes. Sony is seemingly going through the same thing, with execs being swapped all over the place. Former PlayStation CEO Shawn Layden is no longer in charge of PlayStation — now it's John Kodera. The company's latest CEO, Kenichiro Yoshida, is the man quoted above speaking about PlayStation Network; he became CEO in April 2018, and he replaced former PlayStation leader-turned-CEO Kaz Hirai. Yoshida's background is in finance. ""Sony is far from the position that Microsoft was in during that first year of the Xbox One's life, but recent signs point to exactly the type of shift we saw at Microsoft before the launch of the Xbox One."" I did not know a lot of that information and even though they are cocky as all hell I think they will be just fine next gen. If they dominate again remains to be seen.",,The-A-Baum,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,F,,,,,,,

Agreed I own both systems and I picked up a x1S 2 years ago. Heres a prime example of HDR 4k gaming and having that built in 4k player is a bonus. Finished RDR2 on my ps4 slim and decided to trade that game up during the power bump event for certain games a few weeks ago at EB. Picked up another RDR2 for x1 and currently redoing the story and noticed immense quality playing it on a 4k through my x1. Also last week I had a x360 bo2 game disc givin to me and all I can say is looks pretty dang good upscaled in 4k. Not here to down vote Ps4 but I'm bias with owning both",,sixshot28,Canada,Manitoba,Winnipeg,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

That could change in the near future, as Cheddar reported on Monday that the iPhone maker is planning a subscription service that could act like Netflix, but for mobile games. The most pertinent details, like subscription price and the kinds of titles Apple would offer, are still up in the air, according to Cheddar’s report. The company has reportedly been talking to video game publishers since at least the back half of 2018 about the potential subcription service. Apple could even publish some games, per Cheddar. That would be a sharp pivot from a company that has, up until now, been somewhat hands-off with an industry that has flourished on its mobile platform. Apple could secure platform exclusivity for games by acting as a publisher. A green leaf adorns the Apple logo on Earth Day at the company's Koe-Bogen store on April 22, 2015 in Dusseldorf, Germany. Photo: Sascha Steinbach/Getty Images for Apple One potential problem with Apple’s idea is that the kinds of games that have historically done well on iOS are free-to-play to begin with. “Fortnite,” for example, has grossed hundreds of millions of dollars on iOS alone for publisher Epic Games. Apple could theoretically offer free in-game currency or exclusive items in games like “Fortnite” for subscribers, but that may not be enough to incentivize large numbers of people to subscribe. It is easy to see why Apple is exploring this idea, though. Subscription services are close to becoming the norm in the video game industry, as all three major console manufacturers now offer something similar to what Cheddar’s report describes. Xbox Game Pass allows Xbox owners to play more than 100 Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One games for a monthly fee. PlayStation Now is a similar service, but for PlayStation 4 owners. Finally, Nintendo Switch Online has a growing selection of retro Nintendo Entertainment System games that subscribers can play. Both PlayStation Now and Xbox Game Pass have become lucrative revenue streams for their respective companies. A gaming subscription service would fit into Apple’s booming services sector. Apple made nearly $40 billion in revenue from services alone in 2018, per Cheddar, so it makes sense that the iPhone maker would explore more opportunities along those lines.",,Alex Perry,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,Apple Planning A Netflix-Like Subscription Service For Video Games,,,
