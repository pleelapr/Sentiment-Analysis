That is right! The game was released in January 31, 1997 in Japan, so it's 20 years old! Happy 20th Anniversary, FF7!!! I remember when I went on a trip far away with my grandmother just to see my mother.That one day, my stepfather bought the game home to play it but couldn't get into the game because he's not a RPG-kind of guy he would enjoy. When I got to play to the game on his Playstation (now known as PS1) from the start, I got addicted to it. The storyline, graphics and gameplay got me so hard to keep playing but I didn't go all the way because of other things to do with the family. Then years later, I got to start the game over and play it through and I found it astonishing as a whole. But it was worth every penny. For when the game was running, it turned to be the RGP game on PS1. Oh man, it was so addicting as hell! To be honest, it was one of the games (quite a few in my time) I played every two or three years. I also have the downloaded the full game on my Playstation 3 Super Slim and all in all spend more hours to explore and collect more things than what I did in the PS1 and PS2 days. Old ol' days. So anyways, this thread is to celebrate the twenty years old legendary game in the Playstation board. Yep, FF7 is/was still an Playstation exclusive.All comments welcome! ====================::==================== So it's older than most of the people played it. Seriously though, it wasn't even the best game available when it came out. It may have been the height of sales for the franchise, but it was the beginning of a terrible decline.

I told him I had it on my PS3, but by that point he had it downloaded to his iPad and was playing it. When I bought my original copy in 1997, I had been going to the one Wal-Mart in our town like over 10 times in the span of 6 months until it finally showed up in stock. I had to have my mother with me to show ID, because I was only 13, to buy it. It cost me $60.00. I could only play it after school for a couple hours until my brother kicked me off the Playstation. Now it's click, buy, and play. You can play it whenever. You can play it while you take a shit, no one bothers you.",,daltonthecooler,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I had a day off from work, and decided to spend the evening relaxing on my bed playing some games on my playstation, now to put this in perspective, I had a few cats at the time so fairly frequently you'd hear them come through the cat flap, but given how often that happened I got used to it and pretty much drowned it out. But on that particular evening I noticed the cat flap rattling frequently, after several rattles downstairs I went out onto the landing outside my room and flicked on the light... I spent a few moments looking down at the cat flap wondering if any of our cats was having trouble getting in, I didn't see anything and proceeded to go back to my room to continue playing. A few minutes later I could smell the distinct aroma of petrol coming from somewhere inside the house, my first thought was that my dad's petrol scooter had started to leak, so I decided to go downstairs and check. On my way down the stairs I saw my mum and dad, who also noticed the smell, and we were all wondering where it was coming from, while I checked my dad's scooter for leaks, my dad went up and down the house trying to locate the source of the smell. After a couple of minutes of feeling around my dad's scooter and finding no leaks at all, I went back to the hallway and continued to search around the house. I suddenly remembered what was going on with the cat flap, and immediately went over to it to check. Kneeling down in front of it, I stuck my hand inside and my worst fears were confirmed. Someone had been pouring petrol into the cat flap, and I can only assume that when I came out of my room to check that I'd scared the bastard away. Quickly I went to the back door and grabbed a crowbar that was hanging up outside near the shed, before heading outside with a torch to make sure that there was no one hiding in the small alleyway next to our house. Finding no one, I went around the outside of the house to make sure that everyone was safe and found a small water bottle next to the cat flap, with a small amount of petrol in there. I brought the bottle inside and showed my parents, they were both shocked that someone would even want to do this to us, and I don't think any of us got any sleep that night. To the asshole who tried to burn our house down, i hope we never meet again.",,kylesesh,,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Reddit,,,,,The Guy Who Tried Burning Down My House,,,

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

Still amazing, still holds up and still feels magical to me. It's one of those timeless games that I don't think will ever age for me, ya the graphics don't look good but I don't care, it brings back great memories and I just think the overall package is amazing! It just got something special to it that makes it really good, plus I love the music, setting and characters. General rule of thumb for me, I never compare games head to head unless it makes sense. Specifically genre based games usually work well for this imo....So FF7 vs OOT or that errr other one, ya not good comparisons for me. FF7 and Zelda OT for me are two games during that generation that I can play today and I have probably played each a dozen times since launch and they are just as good as back then.",,infectedkid6,United States of America,,,Positive,Sadness,Forums,,,,,Final Fantasy VII is 20 years old!!!,,,

Do you please those who got PS4 day 1, but get hate from PS4 Pro people, by releasing PS5 in 2019, barely 3 years again, the same allotted time Pro came after PS4? Or do they wait an appropriate amount of time after PS4 Pro before jumping into PS5, which makes PS4 owners wait even longer but most content with non-Pro anyways, so either way, no on gets alienated, which is probably a 2020 or 2021 release? If I was Sony, I would be going after a 2019 release for PS5 with Vita 2, and show those ass monkeys at Nintendo how to make a proper eco-system, and then also compete with Scorpio. Or if Scorpio isn't that far ahead of Pro, go for that 2020 and get another head start on Xbox, who god knows what their plan will be. Everyone assuming Scorpio is gonna spank PS4 Pro, but without the games it could hurt its chances of ever catching up with PS4. I'm sure with the extra year of time to fine tune, Scorpio will be way better out the gate than Pro was out the gate, but then PS4 Pro had a year to build its market. Scorpio's market is still undefined. Click to expand... There will never be a Vita 2. Click to expand... Well you never know what Sony does, right now it seems like and middle-ware is being replaced by VR. I mean maybe they make a Xperia phone that lets you play your PlayStation Now games on it. Just like how I can play PlayStation Now on my PC. Honestly I would love one, but yeah with any random 2 in 1 you could stream your PS4 to your screen and play in any room.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

Just like you decided to send out these comments, I have the agency to decide to respond. JonTron's tweets don't exist in a vacuum. If he didn't want anyone to respond to him, then he should've written his thoughts about the PSNow in his diary where no one would read it - because, twitter is an open forum where you publish your tweets that everyone can read. It doesn't matter if the tweets were 'transmitted' or not?? It's a public space, where people can respond to whatever they want? He literally just asked him not to use a slur. I'm just so bewildered by the mental gymnastics you're using to come up with this. Twitter is a public space. People are most definitely allowed to ask another user to not use a slur, and calling someone that slur in response to that request is kind of obnoxious and will make an impression on other creators.

This segment will replace sony's portable hardware division and will tether to ps5 when playing AAA games on vr . I think Sony will not bother with portable version of ps5 as they have playstation now for that .

You can indeed access cloud storage from the PSNow XMB, but because you're crossing between accounts you won't be able to access it like this. Also, the cloud saves are not just unique per PSN id, but they're also unique per platform. I have 1gb of storage for my Vita, 1gb of storage for PS3, and 10gb of storage for PS4. These are all separate pools of storage. You can only access the PS3 storage from a PS3. Let's walk through this though: You've got two accounts, A and B. Account A is where you played the game originally, account B is the new account you want to play on from here on out. You've uploaded the save from the PS3 to the cloud using which account? Aren't PS3 saves only accessible on a per-account basis? That is, if a save was made using account A, it cannot even be seen in the XMB by account B, thus B could never upload it? This is exactly how it works on a PS4, but I haven't touched an actual PS3 in six years, so I'm a bit rusty on that. Can you confirm the exact steps you've taken? I'm pretty sure you're entirely out of luck due to using a different account, but I don't want to conclude that just yet.",,sugardeath,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Think 12-18 months after PS5 releases, Sony comes out with a PSP2. It plays the same games the PS5 does, just at 720p. It's hard not to be biased about this as it is something i want. However, i feel that there are a few reasons why this would be different to the Vita, and would actually work: 1. Shared/Increased Library For this supposed device to achieve moderate success, it would need to be able to play the same games that next-gen consoles do. Imagine being able to play what we expect to be big cross gen titles: Halo 6, Death Stranding, TLOU2, the next GTA etc on your handheld. Buy once, play anywhere. Given the nature of the product, i feel that the platform's game library (MS or Sony) would see an increase in variety, across game types and genres. But mostly niche games from Japan! 2. Advances in Mobile Computing - @720p Computational power continues to increase in the mobile space. Unlike TV's with low ppi's, the resolution that the Switch has (1280x720) yields a 237 ppi. Comparatively, the new 13' macbook pro has a ppi of 227. At these specs, it would be a very sharp device. If we get native 4k games next gen, 720p is almost 1/10th of the resolution. If needed, drop it to what Vita had, which would be 6.2% of 8k. There is little need to render beyond 720p in a handheld device. Any advances in computing can be put into matching what the next gen consoles have outside of resolution. 1 to 1.5 TF in a mobile device seems plausible in 2020, and could give a very comparable experience to next gen consoles. 3. Different MP Experience Part of what i feel made LAN parties so popular (at least in Asia where i grew up) was the social aspect of it. Cussing at your friends and celebrating together, no wonder smash/mario kart continues to be popular! This could recapture some of those MP experiences, that has diminished with the way we play and experience our consoles. It would be awesome to be able to invite a friend, or go over to their house and play Destiny 2 or Street Fighter 6 together. How do others feel? Kambing ====================::==================== To do a portable ... designs of soc must be within 10 watt range .. amd doesnt have any designs in their roadmap which meets those requirements .. so maintaining bc with this gen will be hard for sony but microsoft can easily emulate given the right hardware. I guess a more probable avenue for microsoft and sony would be to release a standalone vr platform like the new oculus rift prototype . This segment will replace sony's portable hardware division and will tether to ps5 when playing AAA games on vr . I think Sony will not bother with portable version of ps5 as they have playstation now for that . And as per microsoft is concerned if play anywhere is successful they might release a surface tab which grey hawk apus 2019 with sub 15watt and that can play ur aaa games on the go. newbong95",,Mexen,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,The Case for Portable Versions of Next-Gen Consoles,,,

That is right! The game was released in January 31, 1997 in Japan, so it's 20 years old! Happy 20th Anniversary, FF7!!! I remember when I went on a trip far away with my grandmother just to see my mother.That one day, my stepfather bought the game home to play it but couldn't get into the game because he's not a RPG-kind of guy he would enjoy. When I got to play to the game on his Playstation (now known as PS1) from the start, I got addicted to it. The storyline, graphics and gameplay got me so hard to keep playing but I didn't go all the way because of other things to do with the family. Then years later, I got to start the game over and play it through and I found it astonishing as a whole. But it was worth every penny. For when the game was running, it turned to be the RGP game on PS1. Oh man, it was so addicting as hell! To be honest, it was one of the games (quite a few in my time) I played every two or three years. I also have the downloaded the full game on my Playstation 3 Super Slim and all in all spend more hours to explore and collect more things than what I did in the PS1 and PS2 days. Old ol' days. So anyways, this thread is to celebrate the twenty years old legendary game in the Playstation board. Yep, FF7 is/was still an Playstation exclusive.All comments welcome! ====================::==================== Not much variety in those choices. Chrono Trigger is better than FFVII and Last of Us. FFVII is certainly among the timeless classics and one of the best RPGs ever made but the real revolution started with Chrono Trigger. It's still the greatest game to ever be made and the story is so intricately designed that it has spawned many theories and parallels with their sci-fi story. You don't have to be a 30-year-old gamer to know the impact CT did for gaming. FFVII is remembered as being more mainstream but CT started the golden age under old Square. The game did so many things ahead of their time. Writing, graphics, gameplay, character development, etc. It was in an era where games didn't really put much thought behind writing strong narratives and characters. It was able to go from a very lighthearted gathering to a deeply mature RPG where kids needed to grow up fast due to the immense burden on their shoulders. The story had so many deep twists and turns that tugged at your emotional strings. It was so well thought out that the game could teach life lessons. Not to mention it was made by a complete legendary cast of developers who are mostly retired now in the industry. Go look at the credits and tell me you don't recognize at least 20 of those developers as being highly influential people in the industry. They don't make them like that anymore. It was a team full of young very talented and ambitious devs that helped save Square and change the industry. It can be argued CT is the most influential RPG to ever come out. What I always found amazing about this game was how complex their writing was yet due to the lighthearted nature at times it connected well with kids like myself who would not fully understand the writing until he got older. The game just has a charm you don't see anymore in gaming. When I remember my childhood I somehow always remember this game no matter what moment I'm thinking about. It doesn't even have to be related to gaming I just remember this game. That's a huge impact and I know I'm not alone. It's THE game that got me into RPGs as my favorite genre. God bless my mom. If she never bought that game on a random thank you to me I would've never discovered this gem and my love for the genre.",,deuce985,United States of America,,,Positive,Sadness,Forums,,,,,Final Fantasy VII is 20 years old!!!,,,

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

During the night my dad woke me up to let me know he'd managed to get past that part and I then sat next to him on the couch in the dark as we made it through the final area and then beat the game together.

Speaking at RTX Sydney, a two-day video game convention hosted by Rooster Teeth!, the creator of the Metal Gear series told IGN that he sees Nintendos upcoming Switch gaming console as the next step in an evolution he imagined years ago with the feature known as Transfarring that allowed players to transfer saves between different versions of a Konami game. I believe [Switch] is an extension of that idea, he said. The fact you can play something at home and take it outside, this is the gamers dream. The Switch is an evolution of that. Transfarring, a phrase that to this day should never be written or uttered outside the safety of quotation marks, was originally revealed in 2011 right before that years E3. In a video, Kojima explained how the new feature would allow people share progress between the PS3 and PSP versions of games like Metal Gear: Peace Walker. It was supposed to be the beginning of a whole new gaming lifestyle. Click for full size The official description of the service included, among others, the following promise: TRANSFARRING will free you from restrictions of location or time, allowing you to play freely anytime, anywhere. Experience a new degree of freedom in gaming that may one day make console wars a thing of the past. At RTX Sydney, Kojima called for games to emulate movies and television in the ease and variety of platforms that people can use to enjoy the latter. While I can play the digital version of a downloaded movie or album just about any smart device, most games are still hindered by competing proprietary formats and software requirements. Shortly after Kojima revealed Transfarring, the whimsically named game feature was already being made obsolete by things like Sonys Cross-Buy and Cross-Save services. But for every indie game like Rogue Legacy or Titan Souls that supports the ability to share a single save file and game purchase between the Vita and PS4, there are games like World of Final Fantasy that dont. Meanwhile, I can use Netflix and Spotify to save movies, television shows, and music locally to my phone so I can access them even when Im not at home. Click for full size @HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN This is not ""TRANSFARRING"" but remote play. By using PS4 as family cloud environment, you can play it outside.Finaly! 1:20 AM - 15 Jan 2014 More recently, Sonys tried to solve this problem with more robust Remote Play options. While being able to stream Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain on PS4 to a Vita made helped gloss over the shortcomings of Transfarring, being able to stream PS4 games to any PC has helped take the dream of seamlessly playing games wherever, whenever, another step forward. But even then, Sonys relationship with cloud computing and save syncing remains fraught. With Metal Gear's Splendid Vita Version, I Finally 'Get' Portable Console Gaming Despite the issues that still plague different implementations of cloud computing, like those holding back Playstation Now, Kojima was bullish on the prospects for the technology going forward. I feel like cloud technology is what everything will eventually move to, he said. Its further behind right now than I think where people thought it would be at this point, but I think it will go there, and when the infrastructure is ready, youll be able to play everything, on every device, anywhere. The Switch is the predecessor to this step. When asked at the event by DualShockers whether his latest project, Death Stranding, might slip to PS5, Kojima was adamant it would release on the PS4 as intended. Theres a lot about the game we still dont know, however, like whether it will be Transfarring enabled.

It's one of those timeless games that I don't think will ever age for me, ya the graphics don't look good but I don't care, it brings back great memories and I just think the overall package is amazing! It just got something special to it that makes it really good, plus I love the music, setting and characters. General rule of thumb for me, I never compare games head to head unless it makes sense. Specifically genre based games usually work well for this imo....So FF7 vs OOT or that errr other one, ya not good comparisons for me.

I believe this makes a re-release of any kind an unusually difficult task. I'm not sure how much pull Sony has at the end of the day in regards to the translations and publishing rights in these different regions, assuming they have any desire in the first place. I suspect this is why there is no Demon's Souls on PSNow outside of Japan (where Sony has publishing rights). :/ Never the less, continuing to show demand is ultimately the only way to get things rolling in the first place.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

During the night my dad woke me up to let me know he'd managed to get past that part and I then sat next to him on the couch in the dark as we made it through the final area and then beat the game together. I'll never forget that. To this day Final Fantasy VII means a lot to me. It's always fighting for the title of my favorite game of all time with a couple of other games that are special to me. I don't think a lot of people nowadays can understand how mind-blowing FFVII was at the time, it was such a revelation.

In addition the patent outlines a spectator UI that can be used to view broadcast streams, join live game session and start new game sessions. Autconomy PDF file of the patent itself Seems like a downgrade to most platforms, seeing as how it's region locked to the US in the patents, but good luck to Amazon for at least trying. ====================::==================== Found where they talk about buying games. They have a figure in here that seems like an OnLive/PlayStation Now type streaming system for trying games: Also some other parts from the wordy bits: [0070] In some embodiments, the spectating system may leverage the game metadata to allow spectators to join or step into games being broadcast via the spectating system . In some embodiments, the broadcast content presented to the spectators on a spectating UI may include user interface elements via which spectators can order, purchase, or oth- erwise obtain demo or full versions of games . In some embodiments, game client software and game data for participating in demo or full versions of online games may be obtained and downloaded to the spectators devices via the spectating system interfaces and broadcast streams . [0071] In some embodiments, the spectators may use the spectating UI to obtain the game client software, game data, characters, and gear via the broadcast streams, and may also obtain, step into, and replay previous game sessions or portions of game sessions. In some embodiments, game states can be purchased or otherwise obtained via the spectating system interfaces and broadcast streams. In some embodiments, the broadcast content presented to the spec- tators on a spectating UI may include user interface elements via which one or more game states, for example the game states provided with the game metadata, may be advertised, obtained by the spectator, and used to regenerate the game session universe and start or resume game play at the respective point in the game session timeline, with the spectator becoming a player and stepping into the game session universe and timeline, either using their own in- game character or avatar or stepping into and taking control of a character that is already in the game session . They also reference Frame 744 a lot, which is on the right side of this image: They mention that users can buy games from the frame, but doesn't say if it's buying it through Amazon or through their supposed service. Edited: Actually, they mention at one point that it can be bought from the ""Game system provider"" As another example, the viewer may interact with the UI elements displayed in game information 744 pane to get more information about the game, or to obtain or purchase the game, from the game system provider or from some other source .",,The freeman,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Amazon Files Patent For What Seems Like a Steam Competitor,,,

PS3 has limited backward compatibility using the PS2 on PS4 program (for a per-game fee) and PSNow for a large, but limited selection of PS3 games for a monthly fee. Having a Vita means you can play your PS4, even while the TV is occupied. In both cases, you will retain your older account.",,kinyutaka,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Now, I'm not trying to start a platform turf war, but I am trying to say that I think it's a good idea to be able to play with all your friends no matter what console they have the money or mind to purchase. I don't personally like the way PlayStation looks as much as I like Xbox and I do very much enjoy all my Microsoft products, but I have friends who think opposite me. The thing is, however, half my friend group likes Xbox and half like PlayStation. And I feel like we're separated by that because we can't enjoy a good game together. Only half of us can play together either way. And I'm sure there are plenty of cases like this, so I'm trying to open Microsoft's eyes to this and I urged my PlayStation friends to ask something similar to PlayStation. Maybe one day we could all play together and enjoy games we all love to play, while still enjoying the look and feel of our preferred console. 2 votes",,SoupyLettuce590,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,gta 5 cross platform with playstation [updated],,,

When I got to play to the game on his Playstation (now known as PS1) from the start, I got addicted to it. The storyline, graphics and gameplay got me so hard to keep playing but I didn't go all the way because of other things to do with the family. Then years later, I got to start the game over and play it through and I found it astonishing as a whole. But it was worth every penny. For when the game was running, it turned to be the RGP game on PS1. Oh man, it was so addicting as hell! To be honest, it was one of the games (quite a few in my time) I played every two or three years. I also have the downloaded the full game on my Playstation 3 Super Slim and all in all spend more hours to explore and collect more things than what I did in the PS1 and PS2 days. Old ol' days.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

Have you read this crazy in depth story over on Polygon about Final Fantasy 7? http://www.polygon.com/a/final-fantasy-7 With Final Fantasy 7 now approaching its 20th anniversary and a high-profile PlayStation 4 remake in development, we decided to look back. Over the past two years, Polygon tracked down more than 30 people who had a hand in the original game and asked them to tell the story of its creation. Below, in their words, you’ll find a story about a company in transition — and the money, politics and talent that pushed it over the edge.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through.

When I got to play to the game on his Playstation (now known as PS1) from the start, I got addicted to it. The storyline, graphics and gameplay got me so hard to keep playing but I didn't go all the way because of other things to do with the family. Then years later, I got to start the game over and play it through and I found it astonishing as a whole. But it was worth every penny. For when the game was running, it turned to be the RGP game on PS1. Oh man, it was so addicting as hell! To be honest, it was one of the games (quite a few in my time) I played every two or three years. I also have the downloaded the full game on my Playstation 3 Super Slim and all in all spend more hours to explore and collect more things than what I did in the PS1 and PS2 days. Old ol' days.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion).

Far Cry 4 gave us Modifiers, I would seriously like these adding into FC2 and then it could be almost perfect for me. I personally struggled with the slow speed on vehicles (I think they worked great in Single Player but for MP would love an option to increase the speed a little and lock the user created map with the speed then set) Another thing I would like is the vehicles to take a little more damage in some maps, FC4 has the wreck-less driving where they don't damage when you bump into things, this could be useful as I found myself getting out to heal the car all the time. Even though FC2 has the weapon class system I would also like to be able to place a few weapons into user created maps. They could also up the limit on items in the map editor, the PC handled loads more on screen so I would hope more than 8 years later the XB1 and PS4 could handle somewhere near the same number of allowance for our maps. I would also pay full price for Far Cry 2 remastered or a PC Port with some extras. Far Cry 2 / 3 / Blood Dragon was listed to become backwards compatible but as yet I believe only FC Blood Dragon got this treatment. Also looking at Playstation Now they have no Far Cry games available to stream / play. Far Cry 3 did look excellent on the PC compared to the Xbox 360 version so maybe they will eventually do a port from PC to PS4 / XB1 or some kind of remastered versions.",,FALLEN_CHAMP,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

afec7d6c-0660-4daa-b814-e6b335d8cdea,2/3/2017,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGames/comments/5rvmda/been_out_of_gaming_for_almost_ten_years_can/ddb8j71/,"I will try to give my two cents: 1.) I've seen that PS3s and other consoles list harddrive size. What is this used for? As someone who only knew discs, memory cards, and cartridges, I don't know the specifics about this. Is it mostly for online available content, like some kind of bonus material, and for virtual console-type emulation of older games? A hard drive is for storage. That's it. Think of it as an internal memory card, only with much more space. Almost all games are available digitally now, so when you download any content or data such as a full game, it gets stored here along with your saves and updates to the game. Games are still available via disc, but newer consoles give you the option to install a game from a disc onto the hard drive. This allows the game to run a bit better and faster. So basically, a hard drive's size will determine how much stuff you can have on it. Newer consoles I think run with 512GB to 1TB (1024GB) of hard drive space as an option. Modern games can be anywhere from 3GB to 45GB+ each, so go for the hard drive size you think best fits your needs (will you have alot of downloaded games, or only a few at a time? You can also own a game and not have it installed to conserve space, then just uninstall another game and install the owned game to play it. You will still own both games.) 2.) What should I look for in a used console? Is anything backwards compatible anymore? I.E. Should I bother getting a PS3 if I can get a certain model of PS4? When it comes to a used console, you want to look at the hard drive size, if it comes with all of its cables and if it comes with any controllers, console condition, and model. Consoles have different models that perform better or worse compared to other models. For example, the PS3 came out in 2006. They then released a Slim model in 2009 which was quiter, slimmer, and used less power. Eventually they released the Super Slim model in 2012 which was slimmer than the previous Slim model and offered much larger hard drive sizes. The PS4 also has a Slim version and a more recent model called PS4 Pro. This isn't always the case, but basically the newer models run better, are smaller, and come with more features. PS4 does not offer backwards compatibility directly, however, they offer a workaround through Playstation Now. With this feature, you can stream select emulated PS3 and PS2 games to your PS4. If you can afford a PS4, I would easily recommend it over a PS3. Obviously, I would suggest the Pro, then the Slim, and lastly the standard model. But if those options are affordable the standard PS4 model is just fine. 3.) Based on some of the games/series I have listed below, what are some games or new series I might have missed out on? Obviously, any sequels to the franchises you've listed would be a miss such as Devil May Cry 4 or God of War 3. Games similar to the ones you've listed would be Ninja Gaiden, Dante's Inferno, The Evil Within, Darksiders, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, and Brawlhalla. There is an anticipated title coming out soon called Yooka Laylee that has a huge resemblance to Banjo Kazooie. 4.) Based on those recommendations, is there a newer console that seems like a better fit for me to buy? The Evil Within, Resident Evil 7, 'Tales of' series, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, Dante's Inferno, Darksiders, Dishonored, Deus Ex: Human Revolution. 5.) I think I read someone that newer consoles aren't using physical media like discs anymore, and that it's all online purchases and downloads. Is this true or partially true? Partially true. You can still buy the disc form of games from stores and online retailers. Major releases and even some minor releases usually come with a disc option to purchase. Not all games can be purchased by disc though, such as the emulated older PS3 and PS2 games to work on the PS4 (Some Xbox 360 game discs are backwards compatible with the Xbox One), most indie titles, and the digital market exclusive games. 6.) Anything else you can think of? If you get a chance to try Dark Souls, try Dark Souls. I can't really compare it to any game you've listed, other than perhaps a much more difficult and darker Zelda Skyward Swords style combat. It's a third person RPG that offers the difficulty and rewarding satisfaction older games used to offer.",,ThePharros,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Fresh off the acquisition of popular video game streaming site, Twitch, for $970 million, Amazon seems to be setting the stage to expand its online empire into the video game marketplace. Amazons patents (us20170001111a1) describe a user interface that can be used to order, purchase, or otherwise obtain demo or full versions of games. In addition the patent outlines a spectator UI that can be used to view broadcast streams, join live game session and start new game sessions. Autconomy PDF file of the patent itself Seems like a downgrade to most platforms, seeing as how it's region locked to the US in the patents, but good luck to Amazon for at least trying. ====================::==================== Found where they talk about buying games. They have a figure in here that seems like an OnLive/PlayStation Now type streaming system for trying games: Also some other parts from the wordy bits: [0070] In some embodiments, the spectating system may leverage the game metadata to allow spectators to join or step into games being broadcast via the spectating system . In some embodiments, the broadcast content presented to the spectators on a spectating UI may include user interface elements via which spectators can order, purchase, or oth- erwise obtain demo or full versions of games . In some embodiments, game client software and game data for participating in demo or full versions of online games may be obtained and downloaded to the spectators devices via the spectating system interfaces and broadcast streams . [0071] In some embodiments, the spectators may use the spectating UI to obtain the game client software, game data, characters, and gear via the broadcast streams, and may also obtain, step into, and replay previous game sessions or portions of game sessions. In some embodiments, game states can be purchased or otherwise obtained via the spectating system interfaces and broadcast streams. In some embodiments, the broadcast content presented to the spec- tators on a spectating UI may include user interface elements via which one or more game states, for example the game states provided with the game metadata, may be advertised, obtained by the spectator, and used to regenerate the game session universe and start or resume game play at the respective point in the game session timeline, with the spectator becoming a player and stepping into the game session universe and timeline, either using their own in- game character or avatar or stepping into and taking control of a character that is already in the game session . They also reference Frame 744 a lot, which is on the right side of this image: They mention that users can buy games from the frame, but doesn't say if it's buying it through Amazon or through their supposed service. Edited: Actually, they mention at one point that it can be bought from the ""Game system provider"" As another example, the viewer may interact with the UI elements displayed in game information 744 pane to get more information about the game, or to obtain or purchase the game, from the game system provider or from some other source .",,The freeman,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Amazon Files Patent For What Seems Like a Steam Competitor,,,

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

Last year i switched to PS4 mainly because of the SUPER BAD reputation of PC games and their poor optimization, it even became a trend now to give steam games a good review just because they are working fine, and this is awful. Valve can fix this by making developers request for their approval (let's call it The Gaben's Blessing) by having some sort of test to prove that the game runs perfectly on the official Steam Machines, test can be automated, or by gamers themselves via a Demo. I think this can be a great selling point for Steam Machines : High graphics Free Multiplayer Steam workshop The largest gaming community Exclusives Game Genre A linux based OS that can do much more than just gaming.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

Speaking at RTX Sydney, a two-day video game convention hosted by Rooster Teeth!, the creator of the Metal Gear series told IGN that he sees Nintendo's upcoming Switch gaming console as the next step in an evolution he imagined years ago with the feature known as ""Transfarring"" that allowed players to transfer saves between different versions of a Konami game. ""I believe [Switch] is an extension of that idea,"" he said. ""The fact you can play something at home and take it outside, this is the gamer's dream. The Switch is an evolution of that."" ""Transfarring,"" a phrase that to this day should never be written or uttered outside the safety of quotation marks, was originally revealed in 2011 right before that year's E3. In a video, Kojima explained how the new feature would allow people share progress between the PS3 and PSP versions of games like Metal Gear: Peace Walker. It was supposed to be the beginning of a whole new ""gaming lifestyle."" Click for full size The official description of the service included, among others, the following promise: ""TRANSFARRING will free you from restrictions of location or time, allowing you to play freely anytime, anywhere. Experience a new degree of freedom in gaming that may one day make console wars a thing of the past."" At RTX Sydney, Kojima called for games to emulate movies and television in the ease and variety of platforms that people can use to enjoy the latter. While I can play the digital version of a downloaded movie or album just about any smart device, most games are still hindered by competing proprietary formats and software requirements. Shortly after Kojima revealed ""Transfarring,"" the whimsically named game feature was already being made obsolete by things like Sony's Cross-Buy and Cross-Save services. But for every indie game like Rogue Legacy or Titan Souls that supports the ability to share a single save file and game purchase between the Vita and PS4, there are games like World of Final Fantasy that don't. Meanwhile, I can use Netflix and Spotify to save movies, television shows, and music locally to my phone so I can access them even when I'm not at home.

By using PS4 as family cloud environment, you can play it outside.Finaly! 1:20 AM - 15 Jan 2014 More recently, Sony's tried to solve this problem with more robust Remote Play options. While being able to stream Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain on PS4 to a Vita made helped gloss over the shortcomings of ""Transfarring,"" being able to stream PS4 games to any PC has helped take the dream of seamlessly playing games wherever, whenever, another step forward. But even then, Sony's relationship with cloud computing and save syncing remains fraught. With Metal Gear's Splendid Vita Version, I Finally 'Get' Portable Console Gaming Despite the issues that still plague different implementations of cloud computing, like those holding back Playstation Now, Kojima was bullish on the prospects for the technology going forward. ""I feel like cloud technology is what everything will eventually move to,"" he said. ""It's further behind right now than I think where people thought it would be at this point, but I think it will go there, and when the infrastructure is ready, you'll be able to play everything, on every device, anywhere. The Switch is the predecessor to this step."" When asked at the event by DualShockers whether his latest project, Death Stranding, might slip to PS5, Kojima was adamant it would release on the PS4 as intended. There's a lot about the game we still don't know, however, like whether it will be ""Transfarring"" enabled.

You can play Uncharted 4 without playing the others, but the story will matter more if you do. Plus, that's three games in one, so it would last you longer than The Last of Us (unless you plan on playing TLOU's multiplayer a lot). On the other hand, playing all 4 Uncharted games for the first time in a row could make you tired of the gameplay. The Last of Us is a brilliant game, so that's a solid choice as well.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Ended up succumbing to whatever subliminal messages Sony put into the app and bought a Ps4pro to catch some current and upcoming exclusives on there. Between Ps4 and PC I feel like I have all the games. But that's beside the point. I've got the pro plugged into my computer monitor so its like an extension of my desk-gaming setup. As such I'm using headphones with it and am coming to grips with its quirks and options. I don't have a USB DAC or headphone amp at the moment so I'm limited to using my Sennheiser 598's through the Ds4 headphone jack. Sound is pretty good, obviously a huge step up from PsNow. In Last of Us Remastered its nice to hear entire layers of the soundstage that were missing when I streamed the Ps3 version. At the same time I'm a little confused about the synergy between the game's new audio settings and my Ps4's output to headphones. You'd think I'd want Last of Us' output set to Headphones, but when I do so, audio from rear position, say dialogue from an NPC behind the camera is muddy and hard to make out. Setting the output to Home Theater, and putting the azimuth at 90 to better correlate with a pair of headphones seems to give good positional volume at all points but there's something odd about it, like the soundstage is very tight, like...tighter than a reference room setting on my PC's soundcard and sounds appear closer then maybe they should. I'm wondering if there's any uh special sauce between app settings and Ps4 system settings that I should be aware of or is it just a matter of fooling around until you find what subjectively sounds best?",,Szoreny,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,"New Ps4 owner, - A LOURe audio question, specially for DS4 headphone jack users",,,

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

It’s 2017 and Hideo Kojima is still talking about “Transfarring.”

Advertisement

Speaking at RTX Sydney, a two-day video game convention hosted by Rooster Teeth!, the creator of the Metal Gear series told IGN that he sees Nintendo’s upcoming Switch gaming console as the next step in an evolution he imagined years ago with the feature known as “Transfarring” that allowed players to transfer saves between different versions of a Konami game.

“I believe [Switch] is an extension of that idea,” he said. “The fact you can play something at home and take it outside, this is the gamer’s dream. The Switch is an evolution of that.”

“Transfarring,” a phrase that to this day should never be written or uttered outside the safety of quotation marks, was originally revealed in 2011 right before that year’s E3. In a video, Kojima explained how the new feature would allow people share progress between the PS3 and PSP versions of games like Metal Gear: Peace Walker. It was supposed to be the beginning of a whole new “gaming lifestyle.”

At RTX Sydney, Kojima called for games to emulate movies and television in the ease and variety of platforms that people can use to enjoy the latter. While I can play the digital version of a downloaded movie or album just about any smart device, most games are still hindered by competing proprietary formats and software requirements.

Shortly after Kojima revealed “Transfarring,” the whimsically named game feature was already being made obsolete by things like Sony’s cross-buy and cross-save services. But for every indie game like Rogue Legacy or Hyper Light Drifter that supports the ability to share a single save file and game purchase between the Vita and PS4, there are games like World of Final Fantasy that don’t. Meanwhile, I can use Netflix and Spotify to save movies, television shows, and music locally to my phone so I can access them even when I’m not at home.

More recently, Sony’s tried to solve this problem with more robust Remote Play options. While being able to stream Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain on PS4 to a Vita made helped gloss over the shortcomings of “Transfarring,” being able to stream PS4 games to any PC has helped take the dream of seamlessly playing games wherever, whenever, another step forward. But even then, Sony’s relationship with cloud computing and save syncing remains fraught.

Despite the issues that still plague different implementations of cloud computing, like those holding back Playstation Now, Kojima was bullish on the prospects for the technology going forward. “I feel like cloud technology is what everything will eventually move to,” he said. “It’s further behind right now than I think where people thought it would be at this point, but I think it will go there, and when the infrastructure is ready, you’ll be able to play everything, on every device, anywhere. The Switch is the predecessor to this step.”

When asked at the event by DualShockers whether his latest project, Death Stranding, might slip to PS5, Kojima was adamant it would release on the PS4 as intended. There’s a lot about the game we still don’t know, however, like whether it will “Transfarring” enabled.

Chrono Trigger is better than FFVII and Last of Us. FFVII is certainly among the timeless classics and one of the best RPGs ever made but the real revolution started with Chrono Trigger. It's still the greatest game to ever be made and the story is so intricately designed that it has spawned many theories and parallels with their sci-fi story. You don't have to be a 30-year-old gamer to know the impact CT did for gaming. FFVII is remembered as being more mainstream but CT started the golden age under old Square. The game did so many things ahead of their time. Writing, graphics, gameplay, character development, etc. It was in an era where games didn't really put much thought behind writing strong narratives and characters. It was able to go from a very lighthearted gathering to a deeply mature RPG where kids needed to grow up fast due to the immense burden on their shoulders. The story had so many deep twists and turns that tugged at your emotional strings. It was so well thought out that the game could teach life lessons. Not to mention it was made by a complete legendary cast of developers who are mostly retired now in the industry. Go look at the credits and tell me you don't recognize at least 20 of those developers as being highly influential people in the industry. They don't make them like that anymore. It was a team full of young very talented and ambitious devs that helped save Square and change the industry. It can be argued CT is the most influential RPG to ever come out. Click to expand... While I don't agree that Chrono Trigger is better than FF7, I certainly can't disagree with any of your other points. CT is amazing and was hugely influential.",,Codered5,United States of America,,,Positive,Sadness,Forums,,,,,Final Fantasy VII is 20 years old!!!,,,

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

I remember when I went on a trip far away with my grandmother just to see my mother.That one day, my stepfather bought the game home to play it but couldn't get into the game because he's not a RPG-kind of guy he would enjoy. When I got to play to the game on his Playstation (now known as PS1) from the start, I got addicted to it. The storyline, graphics and gameplay got me so hard to keep playing but I didn't go all the way because of other things to do with the family. Then years later, I got to start the game over and play it through and I found it astonishing as a whole. But it was worth every penny. For when the game was running, it turned to be the RGP game on PS1. Oh man, it was so addicting as hell! To be honest, it was one of the games (quite a few in my time) I played every two or three years. I also have the downloaded the full game on my Playstation 3 Super Slim and all in all spend more hours to explore and collect more things than what I did in the PS1 and PS2 days. Old ol' days. So anyways, this thread is to celebrate the twenty years old legendary game in the Playstation board.

Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.",,legendary-hikikomori,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,,Reblog,,

There's been large fixes posted before. MGSV runs wonderfully on PC, and it is the best version of the game. The PS4 runs it great too however. MGS3 will need to be emulated with PCSX2, and it's a little tricky (or at least it was) to get running perfectly. You may have to google around to get it set up properly. MGS: Peace Walker is pretty easy to emulate PPSSPP. It only gets tricky if you're trying to force 60FPS. MGS4 is a PS3 exclusive, and there's no PS3 emulators out that will let you play it. There's one in the making, but it's still early on. It's not ready for general use yet. It's not even on Playstation Now. To play that you'll have to get a PS3. The game is 75% movie though, so watching the Kefka Productions Movie for MGS4 should do the job quite well.

Chrono Trigger is better than FFVII and Last of Us. FFVII is certainly among the timeless classics and one of the best RPGs ever made but the real revolution started with Chrono Trigger. It's still the greatest game to ever be made and the story is so intricately designed that it has spawned many theories and parallels with their sci-fi story. You don't have to be a 30-year-old gamer to know the impact CT did for gaming. FFVII is remembered as being more mainstream but CT started the golden age under old Square. The game did so many things ahead of their time. Writing, graphics, gameplay, character development, etc. It was in an era where games didn't really put much thought behind writing strong narratives and characters. It was able to go from a very lighthearted gathering to a deeply mature RPG where kids needed to grow up fast due to the immense burden on their shoulders. The story had so many deep twists and turns that tugged at your emotional strings. It was so well thought out that the game could teach life lessons. Not to mention it was made by a complete legendary cast of developers who are mostly retired now in the industry. Go look at the credits and tell me you don't recognize at least 20 of those developers as being highly influential people in the industry. They don't make them like that anymore. It was a team full of young very talented and ambitious devs that helped save Square and change the industry. It can be argued CT is the most influential RPG to ever come out. Click to expand...

Speaking at RTX Sydney, a two-day video game convention hosted by Rooster Teeth!, the creator of the Metal Gear series told IGN that he sees Nintendos upcoming Switch gaming console as the next step in an evolution he imagined years ago with the feature known as Transfarring that allowed players to transfer saves between different versions of a Konami game. I believe [Switch] is an extension of that idea, he said. The fact you can play something at home and take it outside, this is the gamers dream. The Switch is an evolution of that. Transfarring, a phrase that to this day should never be written or uttered outside the safety of quotation marks, was originally revealed in 2011 right before that years E3. In a video, Kojima explained how the new feature would allow people share progress between the PS3 and PSP versions of games like Metal Gear: Peace Walker. It was supposed to be the beginning of a whole new gaming lifestyle. Click for full size The official description of the service included, among others, the following promise: TRANSFARRING will free you from restrictions of location or time, allowing you to play freely anytime, anywhere. Experience a new degree of freedom in gaming that may one day make console wars a thing of the past. At RTX Sydney, Kojima called for games to emulate movies and television in the ease and variety of platforms that people can use to enjoy the latter. While I can play the digital version of a downloaded movie or album just about any smart device, most games are still hindered by competing proprietary formats and software requirements. Shortly after Kojima revealed Transfarring, the whimsically named game feature was already being made obsolete by things like Sonys Cross-Buy and Cross-Save services. But for every indie game like Rogue Legacy or Titan Souls that supports the ability to share a single save file and game purchase between the Vita and PS4, there are games like World of Final Fantasy that dont. Meanwhile, I can use Netflix and Spotify to save movies, television shows, and music locally to my phone so I can access them even when Im not at home.

By using PS4 as family cloud environment, you can play it outside.Finaly! 1:20 AM - 15 Jan 2014 More recently, Sonys tried to solve this problem with more robust Remote Play options. While being able to stream Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain on PS4 to a Vita made helped gloss over the shortcomings of Transfarring, being able to stream PS4 games to any PC has helped take the dream of seamlessly playing games wherever, whenever, another step forward. But even then, Sonys relationship with cloud computing and save syncing remains fraught. With Metal Gear's Splendid Vita Version, I Finally 'Get' Portable Console Gaming Despite the issues that still plague different implementations of cloud computing, like those holding back Playstation Now, Kojima was bullish on the prospects for the technology going forward. I feel like cloud technology is what everything will eventually move to, he said. Its further behind right now than I think where people thought it would be at this point, but I think it will go there, and when the infrastructure is ready, youll be able to play everything, on every device, anywhere. The Switch is the predecessor to this step. When asked at the event by DualShockers whether his latest project, Death Stranding, might slip to PS5, Kojima was adamant it would release on the PS4 as intended. Theres a lot about the game we still dont know, however, like whether it will be Transfarring enabled.

Why does Squeenix need to do all that decimal shit?

So that they can rerelease all the games on one console, that way everyone can catch up on the story without having to play the various games on the various consoles. I personally think 1.5/2.5/2.8 are amazing for the fact it lets everyone experience all of the story on the playstation, Square didn’t have to do that but I’m glad they did. Plus they include the full Final Mix versions which were never brought to the U.S that have extra story, characters, bosses, stages, etc. 2.8 also has an entirely new game and a whole movie.

Also the game title of 2.8 is an inside joke with Square Enix. 2.8 + 0.2 = 3 (A.k.a Kingdom Hearts 3) this isn’t that related but three is an important number in the KH universe, The Destiny Island Trio (Kairi, Sora, Riku), The Wayfinders (Terra, Aqua Ventus), The Sea Salt trio (Roxas, Axel, Xion). 

Also if you add up all the numerical titles of Kingdom Hearts…1+2+1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2+3 = 13 and 13 is also a very important number in Kingdom Hearts what with Organization XIII and the 13 users of darkness you will fight in KH3. ~ <3

And to add onto this, if you add just the decimal titles  1.5+2.5+2.8+0.2= 7 and seven is the number of heroes of light that are needed to fight the 13 of darkness.

In short, numbers mean a lot in Kingdom Hearts and that is just some of the reasons why the decimal “shit” is there.

I guess a better question would be: Why did they make the games’ story so batshit insane that they need this many games? Or: Why were they console-hopping in the first place?

A large part of the story was planned in advanced by Nomura himself, he says even if a game is at first meant to be just a one franchise game he likes to add unanswered plot points, just in case which will make room for sequels and if anything, give the players a way to interpret the game in their own way if a sequel doesn’t go through. The story of Kingdom Hearts is a HUUUUGE one, the lore is intense and multiple games help focus on different timelines, characters and stories while also progressing Soras story.

The reason for console hopping was because they couldn’t work on KH with the Playstation since a large part of Squares task force was developing FFXV (FF versus at the time) and all the FF lightning games, so the part of Squares team that worked on KH put the games on other consoles that way the other team could work on Squares other titles for the Playstation.

Now that Kingdom Hearts is a higher priority they remastered the games onto the Playstation so they could do as I said before.

We also went through all the Resident Evil films so we could compare -- obviously we find the games' stories to be stronger, but the movies are mindless and fun. The first one I played was RE4 when it was released on Gamecube. After that I played both REmake and RE0 for Gamecube. I bought a PS3 in the next gen and played both RE5 and RE6 (ugh). My favourite's are probably RE1 and RE7 so far (although 4 has a special place in my heart) and I'm just trying to figure out what to play next. I started playing through co-op RE5 with the gf, which is fun, but I want a new story to play and I know there's a lot of story I'm missing. RE2 and RE3 seem logical choices, but since I only have a PS4 now, those are both unavailable until the remake of 2 comes out (really excited for that).
