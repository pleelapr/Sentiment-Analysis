179308727191,10/22/2018,http://slimgigs.tumblr.com/post/179308727191,"With millions of units sold and a wide variety of games to choose from, it’s no question that the PlayStation 4 has become an ideal choice for players this generation. But it’s absolutely shocking to see just how many downloads on the system account for Internet traffic as a whole.

Statista has recently revealed some new stats about where Internet traffic is generated, which you can see below. Nearly 35 percent of it is unaccounted for (porn, maybe?), while the largest factor appears to be Netflix with 15 percent. However, take a close look on the right hand side.

The report indicates that PlayStation downloads in general — big games, indies or online play — appear to calculate to 2.7 percent. That’s of overall Internet usage. And the fact it’s almost up there with general http usage is simply staggering.
(Photo: Statista)
No other game services placed on the list. Not even Steam, with its millions of consumers and huge assortment of games, ended up on the list around one percent. (More than likely, it, along with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch traffic, is accounted in “others.”) That’s pretty insane.

Not to say that PlayStation Network is perfect by any means. There are times that it can end up crashing, mainly due to server issues or possible proxy attacks, like one that brought the service down for weeks earlier this decade. But for the most part, Sony has optimized it, even with the PlayStation Plus subscriptions, and made it work for the better, particularly with multiplayer-oriented games like the just-released Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 and Grand Theft Auto Online. For that matter, it’s likely to get even more stacked next month as the Red Dead Online beta kicks off alongside Red Dead Redemption 2, along with the highly anticipated Battlefield V.

Whether Sony can keep up this momentum as its PlayStation 5 picks up steam has yet to be seen. But hearing how the system is backward compatible — and how PlayStation Now could play a huge part in it — it’s likely that its dominance can continue. Who knows, that 2.7 percent statistic might grow even further, depending on the games that the company and third parties have in mind for it.

So there you go, PlayStation 4 users. You’re a part of the elite when it comes to Internet usage. Now go online and frag your buddies.

 * Google’s ProjectStream lets you play blockbuster video games with your internet browser, if you’ve got a strong enough internet connection. 
 * Using ProjectStream, the visuals and controls of “Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey” match the look and feel of playing the game on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. 
 * If ProjectStream and other cloud gaming platforms can provide a streaming experience that feels consistent with playing on console, they can lower the price of entry for high-end video games by hundreds of dollars. 
 * Cloud gaming will eventually kill consoles if it can provide gamers with a healthy library of streaming games at the right price. 
Earlier this month Google rolled out a closed beta test for ProjectStream, a video game streaming service that lets you play high-quality video games via the Chrome browser. The beta test includes just one game, the recently released “Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey.”

Developed by Ubisoft, “Assassin’s Creed” is the sort of blockbuster game that would traditionally require a $400 console or gaming computer to play. ProjectStream significantly reduces that barrier to entry; the sole requirement is a 25 mbps or faster internet connection, and controllers are optional.

Having already played “Odyssey” on PlayStation 4, I was skeptical of how ProjectStream would compare to the console experience. After all, ProjectStream isn’t the first cloud-based video game streaming service and the technology hasn’t been a hit so far. Sacrificing graphic-quality or settling for less responsive controls has felt like a requirement for past cloud gaming services, and performance varies greatly depending on the game. Given that “Odyssey” is a brand new game with a huge open world, I was skeptical whether ProjectStream would be able to keep up.


“Assassin’s Creed Odyssey”/Ubisoft


Playing for the first time on a MacBook Pro, my concerns were quickly put to rest. At its best, ProjectStream’s version of “Odyssey” felt identical to playing on PlayStation, the game immediately recognized the PlayStation 4 controller I connected via Bluetooth and showed the correct button icons on screen. There was no noticeable delay in the controls and the visuals seemed overall consistent with what I saw on PS4, though “Odyssey” does have additional support for 4K and HDR on consoles and PC.

I tried ProjectStream with three different computers with three different network scenarios; a 2017 MacBook Pro on 250 mbps wifi, an HP hybrid laptop on a 50 mpbs wifi connection, and my gaming PC with a 970 GTX graphics card on a 1 gbps connection. The experience felt pretty much identical across the three computers, making their difference in processing power feel insignificant.

Running on the slowest internet connection, the HP laptop did experience some brief moments of instability where the image would appear somewhat pixelated and the controls would freeze, but the game would return to normal after a few seconds. On my gaming PC and the MacBook, ProjectStream was essentially flawless.


“Assassin’s Creed Odysessy”/Ubisoft


Consistency is the most encouraging factor of ProjectStream. Knowing that the experience playing via the Google Chrome browser matches console gameplay regardless of the computer  I’m using — as long as the internet speed if fast enough — is great motivation to leave my PlayStation version of the game behind. ProjectStream also carries my game save over automatically so I can easily continue where I left off, whether I’m playing at work, at home, or at a friend’s house. Unfortunately ProjectStream doesn’t work on smartphones or tablets just yet, but it would be surprising if Google can’t find a way to make the service functional on their own Android devices.

ProjectStream represents a convincing jump in cloud gaming technology at a time where gamers are wondering if the next generation of video game consoles will prioritize streaming content over traditional media. ProjectStream takes advantage of Google’s massive server infrastructure and development resources, showcasing a beta product that gamers can be confident in. But even if the technology can match the experience of an Xbox or PlayStation, the next important step will be finding a way to deliver a full library of new and old video games at a price that makes sense.


Sony


Google will also be competing head-to-head with endemic video game brands as it enters the game streaming space. So far the most functional cloud gaming options have been Sony’s PlayStation Now and Nvidia’s GeForce Now, but neither service feels like a true alternative to buying an expensive console or PC. PlayStation Now offers a preselected library with hundreds of games for $20 a month for PS4 and PC, but newer titles are not included. GeForce Now gives players access to specific titles they’ve already purchased for their PC library and charges $25 per 20 hours of streaming time. For reference, “Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey” costs $60 to own and takes at least 30 hours to complete.

Shortly after the rollout of the ProjectStream beta, Microsoft announced its own cloud gaming platform, Project xCloud. Project xCloud will stream games to both PCs and mobile devices with a launch planned for 2019. Microsoft has already shown off touchscreen controls for tablets and peripherals to use Xbox controllers with smartphones. Microsoft already has a separate game subscription service with Xbox Game Pass, which currently players the ability to fully download games on PC and Xbox One instead of streaming them.


Microsoft


During its 2018 keynote, Microsoft executive Phil Spencer teased that the new Xbox devices would make use of cloud gaming as well. Spencer said the company’s goal with Project xCloud is to reach the two billion people playing games around the world, regardless of the hardware they play on.

It will take some time for publishers and gaming platforms to establish a market for streaming games, but ProjectStream has shown that the future of gaming will not depend on selling consoles; great games can be delivered right to your browser. The beta test for ProjectStream is accepting new players on an ongoing basis and will run through January 2019. Follow this link to sign up.

I don't want to screw it up. A good brand like Western Digital or something would be good. EDIT: Would something like this be good?

Hybrid disks like the one you link and the Seagate FireCudas will work as well, but their SSD cache is typically far too small to provide any noticeable benefit. SSDs will have the best performance, and they should result in a mild reduction in generated heat, but it won't necessarily feel like night and day like it is switching to an SSD on a PC, because [I believe] the PS3 only uses SATA1, which is always going to be a bottleneck. Seek times will pretty much be eliminated, and load times may improve, but don't get an SSD and expect amazing performance.",,nmalinoski,United Kingdom,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,The ODE thread,,,

MGS4 was a PS3 exclusive. Maybe playable on Playstation Now but IDK as I don't use that service. Getting your hands on MGS1 is the tricky part. Original was all the way back on the PS1.

I believe it is a problem with the slim models in general. And that is due to the copy protection methods that Sony introduced in the slim models and was incorporated into games after the Slim's release. Games made later in the playstation's lifespan introduced a method that checked if a mod chip was installed and would constantly check the region code on the PlayStation. Now this only works on the slim models because they were designed with this in mind. I believe this protection method is what is causing the load times to suck. Something Sony did not incorporate into the PS2. A fat PS1 lacks this copy protection method so games should load faster on them. If you know anyone with a fat PS1, try the game out on there console before you run off and get a fat PS1. If it loads faster, then look into getting a fat PS1. If it doesn't load any faster, then just use the PS2.",,KitsuneOfInari,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

179338557752,10/23/2018,http://greatvideogames.tumblr.com/post/179338557752,"GameSpot - Xbox One Game Pass has updated with a few extra tricks and treats this month, adding some extra horror games to the library in honor of Halloween. These are all part of the “2Spooky for Halloween” promotion, which includes more than 20 spooky and scary games as part of Game Pass. The new additions are Dead Island: Riptide DE, Outlast, Hello Neighbor, and Observer.

Dead Island: Riptide takes you to the Banoi Archipelago to fight to survive a zombie apocalypse. The Definitive Edition features remastered access and grants access to all of the bonus content produced. Outlast is a first-person survival horror game that takes you into the heart of a creepy asylum reopened by a corporation with some questionable initiatives. Hello Neighbor is a sandbox stealth horror game that has you investigate your neighbor’s dark secrets. Finally, Observer is a cyberpunk game that has you investigate crimes by delving into your suspects’ fears.

The full Halloween Collection on Game Pass also includes Graveyard Keeper, State of Decay 2, Dead Rising 4, Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0, and more. In case those are all too scary for you, a kinder, cuter Halloween game is also available in Costume Quest 2.

Xbox Game Pass is a subscription-based service that gives you access to download more than 100 full Xbox One and Xbox 360 games. Microsoft adds new games each month, and it offers new first-party releases like Forza Horizon 4 to subscribers on the day of release. Other new additions for October include Wolfenstein: The New Order, Metro 2033 Redux, Westerado: Double Barreled, Lego Indiana Jones, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, and Split/Second.

The competition between subscription services appears to be heating up as well, because Sony recently expanded its own PlayStation Now program to allow game downloads. http://dlvr.it/QpBR2h - View More",,greatvideogames,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Xbox One Game Pass Adds Horror Games For Halloween,Post,,

179470838218,10/26/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/179470838218,"Microsoft has plans to expand the Game Pass subscription service from Xbox One to PC. CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mentioned during an earnings call that bringing Game Pass to PC will help increase the strength of the Xbox brand.

Ars Technica reports that Nadella didn’t give any indication of when to expect the subscription to expand, or if it would be included within the same all-you-can-eat price as the Xbox version. It would make some sense for the service to be all-encompassing, given that its current “Play Anywhere” initiative has made PC and Xbox versions of games available across both platforms regardless of where you bought it.

On the Xbox One, though, Game Pass has an isolated marketplace for such a service, competing only somewhat with the more niche EA Access. A PC subscription service would face competition from other similar monthly services at various price tiers. An Xbox One Game Pass subscription currently costs $10 a month. Expanding that pass to include PC games could come through an optional extra fee without paying for an entirely separate subscription.

Microsoft made a bold play for Game Pass by announcing early this year that it would feature all first-party games, on the day of release. That has included big names like Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 4. The company also works with publishers to introduce a new slate of third-party Game Pass games every month, and the list is growing pretty large. It also made Game Pass part of its All Access plan, which bundles the console, Game Pass, and Xbox Live Gold together.

Meanwhile, Sony appears to be keen on competing with Microsoft, changing its PlayStation Now service to allow players to download games. PlayStation Now had been a strictly streaming service, which Microsoft will be exploring in more depth next year with Project xCloud.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Xbox Game Pass Planned To Expand To PC,Post,,

179460842760,10/26/2018,http://koragame.tumblr.com/post/179460842760,"Xbox Game Pass Will Expand To PC Microsoft has plans to expand the Game Pass subscription service from Xbox One to PC. CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mentioned during an earnings call that bringing Game Pass to PC will help increase the strength of the Xbox brand.Ars Technica reports that Nadella didn’t give any indication of when to expect the subscription to expand, or if it would be included within the same all-you-can-eat price as the Xbox version. It would make some sense for the service to be all-encompassing, given that its current “Play Anywhere” initiative has made PC and Xbox versions of games available across both platforms regardless of where you bought it.On the Xbox One, though, Game Pass has an isolated marketplace for such a service, competing only somewhat with the more niche EA Access. A PC subscription service would face competition from other similar monthly services at various price tiers. An Xbox One Game Pass subscription currently costs $10 a month. Expanding that pass to include PC games could come through an optional extra fee without paying for an entirely separate subscription.Microsoft made a bold play for Game Pass by announcing early this year that it would feature all first-party games, on the day of release. That has included big names like Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 4. The company also works with publishers to introduce a new slate of third-party Game Pass games every month, and the list is growing pretty large. It also made Game Pass part of its All Access plan, which bundles the console, Game Pass, and Xbox Live Gold together.Meanwhile, Sony appears to be keen on competing with Microsoft, changing its PlayStation Now service to allow players to download games. PlayStation Now had been a strictly streaming service, which Microsoft will be exploring in more depth next year with Project xCloud.

Mid gen upgrades aren't getting next gen games or exclusives. Actual next gen hardware will. The split between PS4 and XBO with the best selling multiplat games hovers around 50 to 60% in PS4's favour, despite the fact the PS4 has sold twice the hardware. That ratio can easily switch around when generations reset with next gen hardware. If one competitor fumbles, the others can benefit hugely. Guess what? Allowing your competitors a huge head start in a new generation is a fumble. And again, you miss the point. 360 launched first and had a year head start. That allowed it to build a competition free momentum and as such Sony was forever playing catch up in the software ratio, the hardware sales, etc. That's the benefit to launching with a head start: Your competition has no answer and so the enthusiasts jump onto your platform, and when they do the mainstream aren't far behind. If you think that won't happen again if PS5 launches much later then you're fooling yourself. In this industry, no company's hold on the market is unshakeable. To say Sony will be fine in ignoring what MS is doing is laughable. You never do that with your direct competitor. When you underestimate you end up losing the leading position. Especially when that competition is already ahead in terms of services and has made it abundantly clear they are doubling down to deal on solving their main weakness with acquisitions galore. Why do you think Sony has added downloads to PSNow? It was in response to Game Pass and Sony has made it clear they are not stopping there with services. Sony clearly has a different view from you and are treating the competition seriously by making changes now to prepare for next gen. One of those moves will be to not launch later. Anoher will be to not launch with a higher price.",,ooombasa,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

If you read Ars Technica (or simply play online games regularly), you’re probably accustomed to game makers shutting down online gameplay servers at will, often with little-to-no notice. When it comes to the impending server shutdown for early PS3 release Warhawk, though, Sony seems to have actually broken its own long-standing promise regarding the timing of such a move.

Warhawk was one of Sony’s first experiments in online gaming, releasing in August of 2007, just months after the launch of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Network. Over 11 years later, a handful of players still seem to be enjoying the online-only dogfight simulation, thanks in part to the game’s inclusion in Sony’s PlayStation Now streaming service. One player who talked to Ars described the active player base as running anywhere from several hundred to a couple thousand-strong, and nearly 400 people are still subscribed the Warhawk subreddit as of this writing.

On September 25, though, those remaining Warhawk players noticed a new message had appeared on the PlayStation Store page for the game. It warned:

I've been doing a lot of work on my machine to get it exactly how I want it. Only 1 game is missing from my library at this point (must have games), and that is either gauntelt legends or dark legacy. I got it ""working"" on mame, but it was SO slow, it was unplayable. N64 seems to be a no go, from what I've been researching. I know many people get it on Dreamcast, but my PC wont run the dreamcast emulators (I have a Dell Dimensions running XP, and Dreamcast came out around the same time, so it seems that system is too powerful for my PC). So that leaves me with only 1 option, Playstation. So my questions for anyone here is, given the info I just provided do you think I can get Playstation running on my machine? If so, what emulators do you recommend? Is playstation emulation pretty well done (I have never really tried to get it running before)? Is Guantlet on Playstation a good port? Is it worth the trouble to go through to get it running? As I said before, Gauntlet is REALLY the only game I'm interested in adding at this point. Yes, if I get it running I would also add games like Resident Evil and Tomb Raider, but again Gauntlet is what I'm AFTER. Thanks for any help you guys can offer. ====================::==================== So I answered my own questions. I went a head and got a playstation emulator. I am genuinely shocked how WELL it runs. I've only found a couple of games that dont work. So it has officially become my ""make up"" emulator, any games that I was missing, I have on playstation now. I'm still in disbelief that it's really become one of my strongest emulators on my system now. I guess because I couldn't get Sega Saturn, Dreamcadt and even Atari Jaguar running very good, I figured Playstation would also be a a no go. I've had to go with the less than stellar port of Gauntlet Legends, which is a bummer (no 4 player, clearly weaker graphics). But it's better than not having it at all I suppose. Plus the resident evil and tomb raider games DO help make up for it. I also could NOT get games like Marvel vs Capcom, Street Fighter alpha series, and a couple others to work in mame. So at least I have them on Playstation now. So all things considered it really is a good emulator to play ""catch up"" with. No they wont be the arcade versions, but better than nothing.",,MikeyJ122,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,Playstation emulator questions,,,

I saw an official statement from Microsoft basically say that they acknowledge some Xbox Play Anywhere games already allow you to play them on PC via gamepass and that they essentially wanted to expand on that. I know there are a couple like Gears of War and Quantum Break that went to PC before the Play Anywhere program began so possibly they could add them into the fold. Ultimately I don't even think Microsoft fully knows what their next plan is they just know the audience and money is there and they seem to be more willing to experiment and try so I wouldn't be surprised if it's actually all of the above.

If you read Ars Technica (or simply play online games regularly), you’re probably accustomed to game makers shutting down online gameplay servers at will, often with little-to-no notice. When it comes to the impending server shutdown for early PS3 release Warhawk, though, Sony seems to have actually broken its own long-standing promise regarding the timing of such a move.

Warhawk was one of Sony’s first experiments in online gaming, releasing in August of 2007, just months after the launch of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Network. Over 11 years later, a handful of players still seem to be enjoying the online-only dogfight simulation, thanks in part to the game’s inclusion in Sony’s PlayStation Now streaming service. One player who talked to Ars described the active player base as running anywhere from several hundred to a couple thousand-strong, and nearly 400 people are still subscribed the Warhawk subreddit as of this writing.

On September 25, though, those remaining Warhawk players noticed a new message had appeared on the PlayStation Store page for the game. It warned:

The first step would be something more like Game Pass and Access that let you download and install games instead of streaming only. These services are available on console too, but I don't think retail will disappear easily (mainly 'cause of games resale value). In the distant future (30+ years from now) we will get faster connections, so streaming games on every single device (smartphone, laptops, console, VR headsets etc) will be common. What's next, these gaming companies will get tired of relying on other internet infrastructures and they will start building their own, so expect Microsoft, Sony, Google, Nvidia as internet providers too. Of course some of them might fail before this future, but that's what I could possibly imagine.",,nightmare_detective,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

179334711426,10/22/2018,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/179334711426,"Xbox One Game Pass has updated with a few extra tricks and treats this month, adding some extra horror games to the library in honor of Halloween. These are all part of the “2Spooky for Halloween” promotion, which includes more than 20 spooky and scary games as part of Game Pass. The new additions are Dead Island: Riptide DE, Outlast, Hello Neighbor, and Observer.

Dead Island: Riptide takes you to the Banoi Archipelago to fight to survive a zombie apocalypse. The Definitive Edition features remastered access and grants access to all of the bonus content produced. Outlast is a first-person survival horror game that takes you into the heart of a creepy asylum reopened by a corporation with some questionable initiatives. Hello Neighbor is a sandbox stealth horror game that has you investigate your neighbor’s dark secrets. Finally, Observer is a cyberpunk game that has you investigate crimes by delving into your suspects’ fears.

The full Halloween Collection on Game Pass also includes Graveyard Keeper, State of Decay 2, Dead Rising 4, Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0, and more. In case those are all too scary for you, a kinder, cuter Halloween game is also available in Costume Quest 2.

Xbox Game Pass is a subscription-based service that gives you access to download more than 100 full Xbox One and Xbox 360 games. Microsoft adds new games each month, and it offers new first-party releases like Forza Horizon 4 to subscribers on the day of release. Other new additions for October include Wolfenstein: The New Order, Metro 2033 Redux, Westerado: Double Barreled, Lego Indiana Jones, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, and Split/Second.

The competition between subscription services appears to be heating up as well, because Sony recently expanded its own PlayStation Now program to allow game downloads.

Now i'm a big fan of this idea, but an example that's always made is: - The ICR is a big problem on console, but on PC it's just the SMG's that are OP and not the ICR. (Yes, the dual wield and wildfire spitfire are absolutely ridiculous on PC). I'm currently prestige 6, and i'm just sick of getting 1 shot by an ICR from whatever range, all the time. The gun is a massive problem on PC as well and the argument that ""accuracy with autoaim on consoles is what makes the ICR so good"" isn't relevant when you can have god aim on PC. I've got all the AR's golden, and I have to say that the ICR is just hands down the best AR out there. Sometimes I even think that it's not even the accuracy or damage, it sometimes feels like it's bugged somehow. Where the gun just suddenly chunks so hard that it almost has to do something with damage numbers being out of control. I'm just not sure anymore. It's the first AR, it's the best AR and even level 1 players of which the aim isn't very good yet can just spray me down with it. TLDR: The ICR is a massive problem on the PC as well, not just consoles. This is a frustration thread because i'm simply just tired of getting one shot by it. From both noobs spraying me d own to people abusing the gun to it's fullest potential.",,Screamzvevo,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Gold includes the base game as well as all DLC up to Clockwork City I believe. Of course, the other option would be to grab a copy of Sumerset, which includes that expansion and the base game and if if you get completely into the game and finish all that content (which is a lot) then sign up for ESO PLUS and get access to all dlc released so far, including the upcoming Murkmire next month. As far as I know, when it comes to PSNOW, yes, your characters and such will still be on Zenimaxs servers, so you can continue where you left off. ESO can be overwhelmng to new players due to all the content, but just take your time and don't worry about missing out on much. The base game alone has tons of stuff to do.

It's just lacking that forza feeling i had from fh1 and fm1234. I remember getting stick from my mates for switching from gt to fm many years ago, i bought the xbox exclusively for forza and it was great, if i had a playstation now and i was playing gt im not so sure i would make that switch.",,spenceriow,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

179449794050,10/26/2018,http://snewsdotvn.tumblr.com/post/179449794050,"Các tựa game như “Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey” thường đòi hỏi những cỗ máy console đắt đỏ để mang lại trải nghiệm tốt nhất, nhưng điều đó sẽ sớm thay đổi.

Đầu tháng này, Google đã tung ra đợt close beta cho ProjectStream, một dịch vụ stream game cho phép bạn chơi các tựa game chất lượng cao ngay trên trình duyệt Chrome. Đợt beta này chỉ có một game duy nhất: Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey.

Phát triển bởi Ubisoft, “Assassin’s Creed” có thể xem là một blockbuster trong thế giới game, mà để trải nghiệm, bạn cần có một cỗ máy console trị giá tối thiểu 400 USD hoặc một dàn máy tính chuyên game. ProjectStream giảm đáng kể rào cản này; yêu cầu duy nhất của nó là một đường truyền Internet 25 mbps hoặc nhanh hơn, và tay cầm chơi game (nếu có).

Kevin Webb, phóng viên trang tin Business Insider, đã được trải nghiệm ProjectStream, và dưới đây là những nhận định của anh về dịch vụ mới này của Google.

Đã từng chơi Odyssey trên PlayStation 4, tôi khá hoài nghi không biết ProjectStream khi so với trải nghiệm console sẽ như thế nào. Xét cho cùng thì, ProjectStream không phải là dịch vụ stream video game đầu tiên trên nền tảng đám mây, và công nghệ này đến nay vẫn chưa gây được ấn tượng với người dùng. Hi sinh chất lượng đồ hoạ hay chấp nhận thao tác điều khiển với độ phản hồi kém hơn là điều mà các dịch vụ stream game qua đám mây trước đây phải thoả hiệp, và hiệu năng của các dịch vụ này còn tuỳ thuộc rất lớn vào game bạn muốn chơi. Vì Odyssey là một game hoàn toàn mới, với thế giới mở rộng lớn, tôi không chắc ProjectStream liệu có xử lý được tốt hay không.
ProjectStream xử lý những trận chiến quy mô lớn trong Odyssey mà không gặp vấn đề gì 
Chơi thử lần đầu trên một chiếc MacBook Pro, mối quan ngại của tôi nhanh chóng bị dẹp bỏ. Phiên bản Odyssey trên ProjectStream mang lại cảm giác tương tự như đang chơi trên PlayStation, và trò chơi này ngay lập tức nhận diện được cần điều khiển PlayStation 4 tôi kết nối qua Bluetooth và hiển thị đúng biểu tượng các nút bấm trên màn hình. Thao tác điều khiển không xuất hiện hiện tượng delay đáng chú ý nào, và đồ hoạ nhìn chung tương đồng với những gì tôi từng thấy trên PS4, khi mà Odyssey hỗ trợ độ phân giải 4K và HDR trên console lẫn PC.

Tôi đã thử ProjectStream với 3 chiếc máy tính khác nhau, trên 3 mạng khác nhau: một chiếc MacBook Pro 2017 với kết nối Wifi 250 mbps, một chiếc laptop lai của HP với kết nối Wifi 50 mbps, và dàn PC chơi game của tôi, với card đồ hoạ 970 GTX và kết nối 1 gbps. Trải nghiệm thu được là khá giống nhau giữa 3 máy tính, khiến sự khác biệt về mặt sức mạnh xử lý của chúng trở nên không còn đáng kể nữa.

Sử dụng ProjectStream với kết nối Internet chậm nhất, chiếc laptop HP quả thực gặp phải một vài khoảnh khắc bất ổn định nhẹ, khi mà hình ảnh có hơi vỡ hạt và điều khiển bị “đơ”, nhưng game nhanh chóng trở lại bình thường sau một vài giây. Trên dàn PC chơi game và MacBook của tôi, ProjectStream về cơ bản hoạt động hoàn hảo.
Sử dụng một tựa game hoàn toàn mới như Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey là một bài test hoàn hảo cho ProjectStream 
Tính nhất quán là yếu tố khiến người ta cảm thấy kích thích nhất của ProjectStream. Việc biết được trải nghiệm chơi game qua trình duyệt Chrome thống nhất với gameplay trên console mà không cần biết loại máy tính tôi đang dùng là gì – miễn là tốc độ Internet đủ nhanh – là động lực tuyệt vời giúp tôi tự tin bỏ phiên bản game cho PlayStation lại đằng sau. ProjectStream còn mang save game của tôi sang nơi khác một cách hoàn toàn tự động, do đó tôi có thể dễ dàng tiếp tục chơi tiếp khi đang ở nơi làm việc, ở nhà, hay ở nhà bạn bè. Không may là ProjectStream không (hoặc chưa) hoạt động trên smartphone hay tablet, nhưng tôi sẽ rất bất ngờ nếu Google không tìm ra cách nào để giúp dịch vụ này hoạt động đầy đủ chức năng trên các thiết bị Android của họ.

ProjectStream cho thấy một bước nhảy đầy thuyết phục trong công nghệ chơi game qua đám mây, ở thời điểm mà các game thủ đang tự hỏi liệu thế hệ tiếp theo của các hệ máy console có ưu tiên stream nội dung thay cho đọc đĩa truyền thống hay không. ProjectStream tận dụng lợi thế của cơ sở hạ tầng máy chủ và nguồn tài nguyên phát triển khổng lồ của Google, từ đó trình diễn một sản phẩm beta mà các game thủ có thể tin tưởng sử dụng. Nhưng ngay cả nếu công nghệ này có thể sánh ngang trải nghiệm của một chiếc Xbox hay PlayStation, thì bước quan trọng tiếp theo sẽ là tìm ra một phương thức để mang đến cho người dùng một thư viện đầy đủ các tựa game mới và cũ ở một mức giá hợp lý.
PlayStation Now đã cung cấp dịch vụ chơi game qua đám mây trong nhiều năm, nhưng lại không bao gồm các tựa game mới nhất 
Google cũng sẽ đối đầu trực tiếp với các thương hiệu video game chính thống nếu họ bước vào lãnh địa stream game. Đến lúc này, các lựa chọn chơi game qua đám mây đầy đủ chức năng nhất là PlayStation Now của Sony và GeForce Now của Nvidia, nhưng không dịch vụ nào mang lại cảm giác như một sự thay thế thực sự cho việc mua một chiếc console hay dàn PC đắt đỏ. PlayStation Now mang đến một thư viện được lựa chọn trước với hàng trăm game, có phí 20 USD/tháng cho PSS4 và PC, nhưng lại không có các tựa game mới gần đây. GeForce Now cho người chơi truy xuất các tựa game cụ thể mà họ đã mua cho PC trước đó, và thu phí 25 USD/20 giờ stream. Để dễ liên tưởng, thì Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey có giá bán 60 USD và cần ít nhất 30 giờ để “phá đảo”.

Một thời gian ngắn sau khi Google tung ra ProjectStream bản beta, Microsoft đã công bố nền tảng chơi game qua đám mây của chính họ, Project xCloud. Project xCloud sẽ stream game đến cả PC và các thiết bị di động, được dự trù ra mắt trong năm 2019. Microsoft đã biểu diễn thao tác điều khiển trên màn hình cảm ứng cho tablet và các phụ kiện để dùng tay cầm Xbox với smartphone. Microsoft cũng có một dịch vụ game trả phí riêng là Xbox Game Pass, hiện cho phép người chơi tải về các tựa game hoàn chỉnh trên PC và Xbox One thay vì stream chúng.
Microsoft dự định mang dịch vụ chơi game qua đám mây lên các thiết bị di động. 
Trong một bài giới thiệu vào năm 2018, Giám đốc Microsoft, Phil Spencer, đã tiết lộ rằng các thiết bị Xbox mới cũng sẽ ứng dụng công nghệ chơi game qua đám mây. Spencer nói rằng mục tiêu của công ty với Project xCloud là đạt được con số 2 tỷ người chơi game trên toàn thế giới, bất kể họ chơi game bằng loại phần cứng gì.

Sẽ mất một ít thời gian để các nhà phát hành và các nền tảng chơi game định hình được một thị trường dành cho stream game, nhưng ProjectStream đã cho thấy rằng tương lai của chơi game sẽ không phụ thuộc vào việc bán máy console; những tựa game tuyệt vời có thể được chơi ngay trên trình duyệt của bạn. Đợt beta test của ProjectStream đang nhận thêm người chơi mới mõi ngày và sẽ thử nghiệm đến hết tháng 1/2019. Bạn có thể đăng ký tại đây.

These are all part of the “2Spooky for Halloween” promotion, which includes more than 20 spooky and scary games as part of Game Pass.

Dead Island: Riptide takes you to the Banoi Archipelago to fight to survive a zombie apocalypse. The Definitive Edition features remastered access and grants access to all of the bonus content produced. Outlast is a first-person survival horror game that takes you into the heart of a creepy asylum reopened by a corporation with some questionable initiatives. Hello Neighbor is a sandbox stealth horror game that has you investigate your neighbor’s dark secrets. Finally, Observer is a cyberpunk game that has you investigate crimes by delving into your suspects’ fears.

The full Halloween Collection on Game Pass also includes Graveyard Keeper, State of Decay 2, Dead Rising 4, Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0, and more. In case those are all too scary for you, a kinder, cuter Halloween game is also available in Costume Quest 2.

If you read Ars Technica (or simply play online games regularly), you’re probably accustomed to game makers shutting down online gameplay servers at will, often with little-to-no notice. When it comes to the impending server shutdown for early PS3 release Warhawk, though, Sony seems to have actually broken its own long-standing promise regarding the timing of such a move.

Warhawk was one of Sony’s first experiments in online gaming, releasing in August of 2007, just months after the launch of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Network. Over 11 years later, a handful of players still seem to be enjoying the online-only dogfight simulation, thanks in part to the game’s inclusion in Sony’s PlayStation Now streaming service. One player who talked to Ars described the active player base as running anywhere from several hundred to a couple thousand-strong, and nearly 400 people are still subscribed the Warhawk subreddit as of this writing.

On September 25, though, those remaining Warhawk players noticed a new message had appeared on the PlayStation Store page for the game. It warned:

What do you think will we get a new dlc in this year? What is your oppinion ====================::==================== The first DLC took them 6 months to add 2 maps that recycled assets with no new boss fight and add another chest system that gives you skins that are just reskins or change the color of your weapon glow from blue to purple (which isn't complicated). We got sidelined for Xbox originally which is why they accomplished so little in that time. Now we're being sidelined for Playstation. Now, with all of that in consideration, I would have to say no, our chances of DLC is extremely low and if we did get DLC it likely wouldn't even be worth the price because the last DLC took them 6 months to add so little and it's only been 2 months since then.

179401138782,10/24/2018,http://fortune-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/179401138782,"This video game shouldn’t run so smoothly.

I’m playing Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on a laptop that sometimes struggles to stream Netflix, but the laptop is operating without any hitches, like I’m on a top-of-line PC.

I then switch to playing Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on a Chromebook, a laptop that wasn’t designed to ever play video games. The game works just as well.

Neither computer comes close to the recommended PC specifications for Odyssey, a graphics-intensive role-playing game that’s expected to be among this year’s biggest sellers. But, the game technically isn’t running on these devices. It’s being delivered via Google’s Project Stream, a game streaming service opened for testing earlier this month that lets gamers play new titles at their maximum graphics settings on devices that normally couldn’t power them. And, as a result, it’s a problem-free experience, regardless of the device used.

Google hasn’t yet disclosed an official debut date for Project Stream. And it hasn’t talked about the price. For an idea, Sony’s PlayStation Now game streaming service costs $20 per month to access a library of 650 games, but the company could just as easily charge for individual games.

Project Stream lets Google dip its toes in the computer and console gaming without having to create any gaming hardware. Doing so would be expensive and take a lot of time.

Still, Google acknowledged the difficulty of building a video game streaming system that can handle, potentially, millions of users simultaneously chasing after monsters and firing blasters. “The idea of streaming such graphically-rich content that requires near-instant interaction between the game controller and the graphics on the screen poses a number of challenges,” said Catherine Hsiao, product manager for Project Stream, said in a blog post announcing the service. “When streaming TV or movies, consumers are comfortable with a few seconds of buffering at the start, but streaming high-quality games requires latency measured in milliseconds, with no graphic degradation.”

Many video game insiders consider game streaming to be the future. With streaming, games are run in the cloud, which means that the data-heavy graphics processing (and other computer-intensive tasks) is handled on a company’s server—and not on players’ PCs, tablets, phones or TVs. And while streaming is fairly typical for watching films and TV programs at home, the interactive nature of games (and the historically laggy quality of most Internet connections) has, until recently, made it impractical for video games.

Today, Internet speeds are faster and connections more reliable. Streaming technology, meanwhile, has improved. Theoretically, any device with a screen can now be a high-end gaming machine, offering sharp graphics and crisp gameplay.

As a result, Sony has already premiered a game streaming service for PlayStation 4 owners. Meanwhile, video game publisher Electronic Arts is working on its own rival while Microsoft plans public trials of its streaming technology next year.

It’s a race to be the “Netflix of video games,” but so far, video game companies are the chief competitors. With Project Stream, Google, a company without much gaming pedigree, has quickly become a contender.

Project Stream isn’t perfect. It’s bandwidth dependent, meaning if your Internet speeds fluctuate too much, gameplay will suffer. For example, if the Internet connection drops below 25 megabits per second, video game players risk seeing some pixelation on their screens—but that rarely happened to me. Also, at present, Project Stream doesn’t work on mobile devices, including tablets.

With Google’s cloud service, games that players save carry over from device to device, so they can easily pick up where they left off. It’s a service that democratizes gaming, letting people experience a game at its highest levels of detail without having to shell out $1,000 or more for a top-tier gaming PC. And Project Stream offers proof of concept to doubters who have been skeptical about whether games would be compatible with streaming.

One of the things working in Project Stream’s favor is that it doesn’t require players to download an app or do anything beyond opening a new tab in Google Chrome. (And as of September, that browser had a 62.5% hold on the market, according to Net MarketShare.) Testers and, eventually, subscribers to Project Stream, can be up and playing in seconds as long as their connections are fast enough (every time users fire up the game, the technology quickly checks).

Because it’s still being tested, Project Stream isn’t available to everyone. Google welcomes new testers, but they must apply (and be over 17 years old, since Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey, currently the only game being tested, is an M-rated game for mature users only). The Project Stream test will run through mid-January, after which (presumably) saved games will be deleted and players will likely no longer be able to explore Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey’s ancient Greece setting and carry out missions.

Google certainly has enough cloud capacity to be a major competitor in video game streaming. Its Google Cloud Platform is one of the top five cloud businesses, serving mainly corporate customers. And it has relationships with video game publishers via its Android mobile division, meaning game makers are more willing to work with it on new projects.

Those relationships aren’t as strong as the ones most publishers have with Microsoft or Sony. However, many publishers and online services are rushing to embrace game streaming. Of course, not everyone will succeed. As a result, publishers are willing to work with a wider variety of corporate partners than they have historically.

“We believe we’re uniquely positioned to deliver a core subscription of interactive content, by virtue of the depth and breadth of our portfolio,” says Andrew Wilson, CEO of Electronic Arts. “That doesn’t mean we can’t work with Sony and Microsoft and Nintendo and Apple [and Google] with the delivery of [our titles] in the same way I watch Netflix.”

What’s critical for game makers is that they still have a direct relationship with people who play their games. Whether the title is played on Project Stream, Microsoft’s Project xCloud or PlayStation Now, video game publishers want to be able to gather data directly from users and be able to tailor games to them individually. To ensure that, players of Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey on Project Stream must first create or log into an account with its publisher, Ubisoft, which maintains customer loyalty and lets the company communicate directly with its customers.

“We will see many players coming and trying to do a Netflix like option,” says Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft. “But I believe there will be lots of services with lots of different types of games. Things are changing often. … What is key is being able to have contact with your player and give them the experience they want.”",,fortune-yahoopartner,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Project Stream Makes Google a Player in the Video Game Industry,Post,,

You realize consumers today still go ""Hmm, I don't want to buy a Windows PC because that Apple commercial from 1999 said they blue screen all the time and always have viruses""? escapist posted... Portability is only a gimmick if you don't go outside. Based on some of the editorials here, some people could sincerely see it as a gimmick. metaphysician posted... Portability has been a feature present on a wide variety of game consoles all the way back to 1989. It might have potentially been a 'gimmick' 30 years ago, but it sure as hell hasn't been a gimmick in a long time. Portability ITSELF is not a gimmick, the way it's advertised as the Switch's central feature in that it's a ""portable"" home console that is a ""hybrid"" is the gimmick. They made a portable game system with video out, and are acting like it's some magic new device that defines everything about it, THAT is the gimmick, not the fact that it's portable. A gimmick, really, is a feature whose value to the consumer is questionable, where all it arguably provides is ""newness"". So yeah, pretty much exactly what I said. This has been a feature in many devices in the past, but never something that was advertised as the core aspect of the device but rather just one of it's many features. This would be like if Sony advertised that the big thing with the PS4 is that it's controller has a speaker and completely centering the console and it's advertising around that. Case in point, this post: Mozzezz posted... I see the Switch as a gimmick cause they marketed the hybrid feature as something really unique when it's not.

Ayep, while the game-of-the-year frontrunner rides off into the sunset with console gamers, us PC folk have been left behind, hanging off our horses by one foot stuck in the stirrup and our faces in the dirt.

Luckily, as non-Red Dead platforms go, the PC is as well stocked with Old West games as a small-town saloon is with moonshine and head lice. It’s not the biggest gaming genre, but a long and storied one, so we’ve found 10 of the best western games for you to saddle up with on PC.



1. The Oregon Trail 

The first western game to really take off on PC wasn’t your classic tale of gunslingers and spittoons, but quite possibly the most cruel and unforgiving educational game of all time.

So what did it educate you about? That attempting to cross the 19th century mid-West in a caravan was a dangerous business. In the original text-based game, you’d lead a caravan of five people (who you’d typically name after family and friends, for extra immersion) then ride them across the US badlands, managing ever-dwindling food supplies while surviving random events like Apache attacks, breakdowns and, most infamously of all, dysentery.

Since its 1971 debut, Oregon Trail has gone through uncounted iterations, many of which you can play online. One of the better modern-day twists on the game is Organ Trail, set in a modern-day zombie apocalypse. And hey, it’s Halloween, so we’re being doubly topical! 



2. Red Dead Redemption

What is game streaming? Is it the future? The death of gaming as we know it? All those questions dissipate like dust in the desert wind when it means that you can play the original Red Dead Redemption on PC via PlayStation Now. 

Granted, it’s subscription-based (a non-negligible $19.99/£12.99 a month), and it’s not currently available in Australia, but just remember that that subscription also includes Bloodborne, and a few hundred other games. But most importantly Bloodborne…

Rockstar’s original great western may never get the proper PC treatment it deserves, so this remains the best way to experience it. It was a refreshing break from the sneering, sardonic world of GTA, telling the tragic tale of John Marston, a former outlaw blackmailed into hunting down his former posse. 

Redemption had plenty of freakish characters and a dark humour of course, but it also billowed in atmosphere; its soundtrack of coyote whistles and harmonicas accompanying you around the beautiful, barren and deadly territories of the US/Mexico border.



3. Westerado

Going a little further left-field now, to the strange place where Indians and Indies lurk in the shrubbery, you can find Westerado. This charmingly crusty-looking game is set on a top-down Zelda-like map, where you wander a western town and its surrounds in search of the no-good sunnuvagun who killed your family.

Each run of the game is only 2-3 hours long, but it maintains its freshness as your target’s appearance and whereabouts are randomised. The world is filled with little side-quests and interactions with the humble folk of Westerado, and it has some nice roleplaying touches, such letting you choose how you speak with people, or even become an outlaw yourself by shooting up people and robbing banks.

It’s a great mini-mix of writing, exploration, and deadly oddball combat that only lets you shoot left and right.



4. Fistful of Doom/High Noon Drifter

All roads lead to Doom, as we like to say here on PC. After 25 years, id Software’s teeth-gritting demonic shooter remains a hotbed of modding creativity thanks to its accessible tools and the timeless mechanical brilliance of the base game.

There are two mods that turn Doom into a more rootin’-tootin’ kind of shooter. Fistful of Doom only contains a couple of western-themed levels, but they’re brilliantly detailed, and during your short time with it you’ll be awash in Spaghetti Western music and the blood of demons in cowboy hats.

Then there’s High Noon Drifter; a low-tech weapon set that gives you the six-shooters, rifles and lassos of a rampant western gunslinger, complete with sliding mechanics and a hat that you can throw around to use as bait. 

You can merge this weaponset into Fistful of Doom for the full western experience, use it with other mods, or even add it to the base Doom games themselves. 



5. Outlaws

A game perhaps best renowned for its lengthy, semi-legendary demo and the jeering soundbite, “Where aaaare you, Marshall?”, Outlaws was the last great pixel-based FPS of the 90s. 

Made by storytelling gurus Lucasarts, it was one of the few shooters of its time to actually have a plot: a revenge tale told through elegantly drawn cut-scenes between missions.

Its levels can get a little labyrinthine later on, but it still plays brilliantly, combining that timeless quality of fast-paced 90s shooters with forward-thinking mechanics like reloading, sniper scopes, and letting you fan off your entire revolver barrel into a roomful of enemies. 

Its orchestrated soundtrack (one of the first in videogames) tips its hat to Morricone too. You can pick up Outlaws at GOG.com, where it was revived a few years ago. 



6. Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive

From a tough time when games weren’t so much concerned with guiding you through to the finish as battering you with a horseshoe, comes Desperados. 

This real-time tactics game puts you in control of a ragtag gang of specialists including a sniper-medic, explosives expert, and a sultry seductress, whose combined skills you use to tackle gruelling missions set in the Old West. It’s a tough old game, with lovely pre-rendered backgrounds capturing those western climes.

Veteran gamers can just think of it as ‘Commandos set in the Old West’.

While the sequels were disappointing, lacking the tight mission design and engaging plot of the original, Desperados 3 is currently in development by Mimimi Productions, the studio behind the excellent Shadow Tactics. It’s the perfect developer to help this lost series ride again.



7. West of Loathing

A relentless stick-figure parody of all the tropes and conventions we’ve come to associate with westerns over the years, West of Loathing is one of the weirdest role-playing games of recent memory. 

This monochrome gem lets you pick between playing a Cow Puncher, Snake Oiler or Beanslinger, then sets you on a quest to uncover why the Cows Came Home. It’s wonderfully-written nonsense; a mix of turn-based combat (against plenty of cows, of course), gag-filled chats with the town’s denizens, adventure game-type exploration and puzzle-solving.

If games were judged on how much they make you smile, this one’s an all-time great.



8. Call of Juarez: Gunslinger

Outside of the Red Dead series, Call of Juarez is probably the most high-profile western franchise in gaming. Which isn’t saying much, because this slick FPS series has always been perpetually overlooked.

If you’re looking for a more story-led experience that still has great gun- and lasso-play, you could try Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood, but Call of Juarez: Gunslinger gets our vote for this list thanks to its high-intensity shooting and gung-ho presentation. It’s more Django Unchained than Unforgiven - self-aware rather than self-serious.

With a crisp cel-shaded aesthetic and damage done to enemies indicated by numbers emanating off them with each shot, Gunslinger makes no bones about its identity as a hyperactive, heightened romp through a high-viz Old West.



9. Gun

Rockstar’s propaganda machine would like you to think that the predecessor to Red Dead Redemption was Red Dead Revolver, but in terms of open-world design and storytelling, it was Gun that laid the tracks.

Made by Neversoft (of Tony Hawk’s fame), Gun was the first true GTA of the West, letting you roam the towns and dusty landscapes of a whopping four American states, with plenty of flexibility for playing the do-gooder hero or the lone-riding bandit. 

The story is engaging, casting you as an Apache marksman tracking down a murderous gang, but you can equally well just amble around hunting buffalo and chatting to folk, many of whom are based on famed western legends and voiced brilliantly by a Hollywood cast.

It may feel a bit creaky these days, but Gun remains the most polished western epic from the days before John Marston shot his way into videogame legend.



10. Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath

Somewhere between Wild, Wild West and Cowboys & Aliens, but much more accomplished on an artistic level, sits this adventure from the gone-but-not-forgotten Oddworld Inhabitants studio.

In the murky, steampunk-inspired setting of Oddworld, you are the titular Stranger, a mysterious mumbling bounty hunter who travels the weird west hunting down outlaws. Everything in the world feels incredibly crafted - from the bug-firing crossbows to the grotesque and vibrant characters you meet throughout the game.

The combat and shooting sections are unremarkable, but the world is richly detailed and filled with character. It’s a western-themed swansong of the Oddworld series, rubbing shoulders with games like Beyond Good and Evil and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time in an era of bold-and-bright adventures.

An HD version of Stranger’s Wrath was released on Steam in 2010.

Never played a Ratchet and Clank game until this one and it's pretty fun. Any chance of a sequel? You guys are crazy to think a sequel won't happen. Its one of Sony's biggest franchises. Insomniac has been busy with Spiderman. And the PS2 and some of the PS3 games are even better than it. Highly suggest you play: The first 3, Deadlocked, Tools of Destruction, Quest for Booty, A Crack in Time, Into the Nexus. i mean, it was a reboot. why would there be a sequel, really? are they gonna reboot the second one or something? i mean, i doubt they're gonna drop the series, but they're probably gonna start another series, not do another reboot of the second one, which would be the 'sequel'. and you listed damn near all of them, really, to play. imo, skip quest for booty and nexus, they're both pretty short (quest for booty could've been like a dlc, its not even meant for a 'full' game...) and they've been making ratchet and clank a long time, maybe they're kinda wanting to go in a different direction now, and did the reboot to kinda finish it off. the remake was the most successful game they've made, until spiderman, presumably, so they know they've still got a fanbase, but who knows. i hope they keep making more ratchet and clank games, personally. Continuing the franchise is what I meant, then. And there's other games like Full Frontal Assault, All 4 One, Size Matters that I feel like could be skipped. I disagree with Quest for Booty and Nexus. You can one and get the other for free and they tie into the story of the Future series.

If you read Ars Technica (or simply play online games regularly), you’re probably accustomed to game makers shutting down online gameplay servers at will, often with little-to-no notice. When it comes to the impending server shutdown for early PS3 release Warhawk, though, Sony seems to have actually broken its own long-standing promise regarding the timing of such a move.

Warhawk was one of Sony’s first experiments in online gaming, releasing in August of 2007, just months after the launch of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Network. Over 11 years later, a handful of players still seem to be enjoying the online-only dogfight simulation, thanks in part to the game’s inclusion in Sony’s PlayStation Now streaming service. One player who talked to Ars described the active player base as running anywhere from several hundred to a couple thousand-strong, and nearly 400 people are still subscribed the Warhawk subreddit as of this writing.

On September 25, though, those remaining Warhawk players noticed a new message had appeared on the PlayStation Store page for the game. It warned:

These are all part of the “2Spooky for Halloween” promotion, which includes more than 20 spooky and scary games as part of Game Pass. The new additions are Dead Island: Riptide DE, Outlast, Hello Neighbor, and Observer.

Dead Island: Riptide takes you to the Banoi Archipelago to fight to survive a zombie apocalypse. The Definitive Edition features remastered access and grants access to all of the bonus content produced. Outlast is a first-person survival horror game that takes you into the heart of a creepy asylum reopened by a corporation with some questionable initiatives. Hello Neighbor is a sandbox stealth horror game that has you investigate your neighbor’s dark secrets. Finally, Observer is a cyberpunk game that has you investigate crimes by delving into your suspects’ fears.

The full Halloween Collection on Game Pass also includes Graveyard Keeper, State of Decay 2, Dead Rising 4, Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0, and more. In case those are all too scary for you, a kinder, cuter Halloween game is also available in Costume Quest 2.

Xbox Game Pass is a subscription-based service that gives you access to download more than 100 full Xbox One and Xbox 360 games. Microsoft adds new games each month, and it offers new first-party releases like Forza Horizon 4 to subscribers on the day of release. Other new additions for October include Wolfenstein: The New Order, Metro 2033 Redux, Westerado: Double Barreled, Lego Indiana Jones, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, and Split/Second.

179474444506,10/27/2018,http://nikhilshakya5.tumblr.com/post/179474444506,"Microsoft has plans to expand the Game Pass subscription service from Xbox One to PC. CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mentioned during an earnings call that bringing Game Pass to PC will help increase the strength of the Xbox brand.

Ars Technica reports that Nadella didn’t give any indication of when to expect the subscription to expand, or if it would be included within the same all-you-can-eat price as the Xbox version. It would make some sense for the service to be all-encompassing, given that its current “Play Anywhere” initiative has made PC and Xbox versions of games available across both platforms regardless of where you bought it.

On the Xbox One, though, Game Pass has an isolated marketplace for such a service, competing only somewhat with the more niche EA Access. A PC subscription service would face competition from other similar monthly services at various price tiers. An Xbox One Game Pass subscription currently costs $10 a month. Expanding that pass to include PC games could come through an optional extra fee without paying for an entirely separate subscription.

Microsoft made a bold play for Game Pass by announcing early this year that it would feature all first-party games, on the day of release. That has included big names like Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 4. The company also works with publishers to introduce a new slate of third-party Game Pass games every month, and the list is growing pretty large. It also made Game Pass part of its All Access plan, which bundles the console, Game Pass, and Xbox Live Gold together.

Meanwhile, Sony appears to be keen on competing with Microsoft, changing its PlayStation Now service to allow players to download games. PlayStation Now had been a strictly streaming service, which Microsoft will be exploring in more depth next year with Project xCloud.

Gamepass is a curated game list that includes new release Microsoft games in addition to games released in the last year. Example Wolfenstein which released last year is already on the service. One step further Gamepass can be had for easily $60 a year with all the half offs they have been running. I bought 3 years for $180. Oh and Xbox actually optimizes their backwards compatible games and updates them. PSNOW is a great service for someone who just has the PSTV or whatever that small box is (I have one of those but never use it). It's also a streaming service which can be great for checking out various games without the larger download. The only thing similar really is they both offer games via a subscription but all the benefits are in two different directions really.",,JoyousGamer,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I don’t really play any of the PSplus stuff now. But it also depends on what you have played previously. I really like PSnow because I never had a PS3 so playing Bioshock, Borderlands, Red Dead, Last of Us and the Batman games has been great. A lot of great gaming is on there ready for you - and if you have a good internet connection too, they play really well. Also handy that you can now download newer PS4 and PS2 games - but again it may depend on if you have played those titles or not? Overall, I would get it. I think around E3 they usually put out a deal that makes it much cheaper (more like 7 or 8 quid a month?) so I would look out for that next year too.",,add286,United States of America,,,Positive,Joy,Reddit,,,,,,,,
179450231225,10/26/2018,http://stopdandruff.tumblr.com/post/179450231225,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is here. Well, not here here exactly, if you’re a PC gamer, as there’s no word yet on when Rockstar’s western epic is coming to our beloved platform. 

Ayep, while the game-of-the-year frontrunner rides off into the sunset with console gamers, us PC folk have been left behind, hanging off our horses by one foot stuck in the stirrup and our faces in the dirt.

Luckily, as non-Red Dead platforms go, the PC is as well stocked with Old West games as a small-town saloon is with moonshine and head lice. It’s not the biggest gaming genre, but a long and storied one, so we’ve found 10 of the best western games for you to saddle up with on PC.



1. The Oregon Trail 

The first western game to really take off on PC wasn’t your classic tale of gunslingers and spittoons, but quite possibly the most cruel and unforgiving educational game of all time.

So what did it educate you about? That attempting to cross the 19th century mid-West in a caravan was a dangerous business. In the original text-based game, you’d lead a caravan of five people (who you’d typically name after family and friends, for extra immersion) then ride them across the US badlands, managing ever-dwindling food supplies while surviving random events like Apache attacks, breakdowns and, most infamously of all, dysentery.

Since its 1971 debut, Oregon Trail has gone through uncounted iterations, many of which you can play online. One of the better modern-day twists on the game is Organ Trail, set in a modern-day zombie apocalypse. And hey, it’s Halloween, so we’re being doubly topical! 



2. Red Dead Redemption

What is game streaming? Is it the future? The death of gaming as we know it? All those questions dissipate like dust in the desert wind when it means that you can play the original Red Dead Redemption on PC via PlayStation Now. 

Granted, it’s subscription-based (a non-negligible $19.99/£12.99 a month), and it’s not currently available in Australia, but just remember that that subscription also includes Bloodborne, and a few hundred other games. But most importantly Bloodborne…

Rockstar’s original great western may never get the proper PC treatment it deserves, so this remains the best way to experience it. It was a refreshing break from the sneering, sardonic world of GTA, telling the tragic tale of John Marston, a former outlaw blackmailed into hunting down his former posse. 

Redemption had plenty of freakish characters and a dark humour of course, but it also billowed in atmosphere; its soundtrack of coyote whistles and harmonicas accompanying you around the beautiful, barren and deadly territories of the US/Mexico border.



3. Westerado

Going a little further left-field now, to the strange place where Indians and Indies lurk in the shrubbery, you can find Westerado. This charmingly crusty-looking game is set on a top-down Zelda-like map, where you wander a western town and its surrounds in search of the no-good sunnuvagun who killed your family.

Each run of the game is only 2-3 hours long, but it maintains its freshness as your target’s appearance and whereabouts are randomised. The world is filled with little side-quests and interactions with the humble folk of Westerado, and it has some nice roleplaying touches, such letting you choose how you speak with people, or even become an outlaw yourself by shooting up people and robbing banks.

It’s a great mini-mix of writing, exploration, and deadly oddball combat that only lets you shoot left and right.



4. Fistful of Doom/High Noon Drifter

All roads lead to Doom, as we like to say here on PC. After 25 years, id Software’s teeth-gritting demonic shooter remains a hotbed of modding creativity thanks to its accessible tools and the timeless mechanical brilliance of the base game.

There are two mods that turn Doom into a more rootin’-tootin’ kind of shooter. Fistful of Doom only contains a couple of western-themed levels, but they’re brilliantly detailed, and during your short time with it you’ll be awash in Spaghetti Western music and the blood of demons in cowboy hats.

Then there’s High Noon Drifter; a low-tech weapon set that gives you the six-shooters, rifles and lassos of a rampant western gunslinger, complete with sliding mechanics and a hat that you can throw around to use as bait. 

You can merge this weaponset into Fistful of Doom for the full western experience, use it with other mods, or even add it to the base Doom games themselves. 



5. Outlaws

A game perhaps best renowned for its lengthy, semi-legendary demo and the jeering soundbite, “Where aaaare you, Marshall?”, Outlaws was the last great pixel-based FPS of the 90s. 

Made by storytelling gurus Lucasarts, it was one of the few shooters of its time to actually have a plot: a revenge tale told through elegantly drawn cut-scenes between missions.

Its levels can get a little labyrinthine later on, but it still plays brilliantly, combining that timeless quality of fast-paced 90s shooters with forward-thinking mechanics like reloading, sniper scopes, and letting you fan off your entire revolver barrel into a roomful of enemies. 

Its orchestrated soundtrack (one of the first in videogames) tips its hat to Morricone too. You can pick up Outlaws at GOG.com, where it was revived a few years ago. 



6. Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive

From a tough time when games weren’t so much concerned with guiding you through to the finish as battering you with a horseshoe, comes Desperados. 

This real-time tactics game puts you in control of a ragtag gang of specialists including a sniper-medic, explosives expert, and a sultry seductress, whose combined skills you use to tackle gruelling missions set in the Old West. It’s a tough old game, with lovely pre-rendered backgrounds capturing those western climes.

Veteran gamers can just think of it as ‘Commandos set in the Old West’.

While the sequels were disappointing, lacking the tight mission design and engaging plot of the original, Desperados 3 is currently in development by Mimimi Productions, the studio behind the excellent Shadow Tactics. It’s the perfect developer to help this lost series ride again.



7. West of Loathing

A relentless stick-figure parody of all the tropes and conventions we’ve come to associate with westerns over the years, West of Loathing is one of the weirdest role-playing games of recent memory. 

This monochrome gem lets you pick between playing a Cow Puncher, Snake Oiler or Beanslinger, then sets you on a quest to uncover why the Cows Came Home. It’s wonderfully-written nonsense; a mix of turn-based combat (against plenty of cows, of course), gag-filled chats with the town’s denizens, adventure game-type exploration and puzzle-solving.

If games were judged on how much they make you smile, this one’s an all-time great.



8. Call of Juarez: Gunslinger

Outside of the Red Dead series, Call of Juarez is probably the most high-profile western franchise in gaming. Which isn’t saying much, because this slick FPS series has always been perpetually overlooked.

If you’re looking for a more story-led experience that still has great gun- and lasso-play, you could try Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood, but Call of Juarez: Gunslinger gets our vote for this list thanks to its high-intensity shooting and gung-ho presentation. It’s more Django Unchained than Unforgiven - self-aware rather than self-serious.

With a crisp cel-shaded aesthetic and damage done to enemies indicated by numbers emanating off them with each shot, Gunslinger makes no bones about its identity as a hyperactive, heightened romp through a high-viz Old West.



9. Gun

Rockstar’s propaganda machine would like you to think that the predecessor to Red Dead Redemption was Red Dead Revolver, but in terms of open-world design and storytelling, it was Gun that laid the tracks.

Made by Neversoft (of Tony Hawk’s fame), Gun was the first true GTA of the West, letting you roam the towns and dusty landscapes of a whopping four American states, with plenty of flexibility for playing the do-gooder hero or the lone-riding bandit. 

The story is engaging, casting you as an Apache marksman tracking down a murderous gang, but you can equally well just amble around hunting buffalo and chatting to folk, many of whom are based on famed western legends and voiced brilliantly by a Hollywood cast.

It may feel a bit creaky these days, but Gun remains the most polished western epic from the days before John Marston shot his way into videogame legend.



10. Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath

Somewhere between Wild, Wild West and Cowboys & Aliens, but much more accomplished on an artistic level, sits this adventure from the gone-but-not-forgotten Oddworld Inhabitants studio.

In the murky, steampunk-inspired setting of Oddworld, you are the titular Stranger, a mysterious mumbling bounty hunter who travels the weird west hunting down outlaws. Everything in the world feels incredibly crafted - from the bug-firing crossbows to the grotesque and vibrant characters you meet throughout the game.

The combat and shooting sections are unremarkable, but the world is richly detailed and filled with character. It’s a western-themed swansong of the Oddworld series, rubbing shoulders with games like Beyond Good and Evil and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time in an era of bold-and-bright adventures.

An HD version of Stranger’s Wrath was released on Steam in 2010.

These are all part of the “2Spooky for Halloween” promotion, which includes more than 20 spooky and scary games as part of Game Pass. The new additions are Dead Island: Riptide DE, Outlast, Hello Neighbor, and Observer.

Dead Island: Riptide takes you to the Banoi Archipelago to fight to survive a zombie apocalypse. The Definitive Edition features remastered access and grants access to all of the bonus content produced. Outlast is a first-person survival horror game that takes you into the heart of a creepy asylum reopened by a corporation with some questionable initiatives. Hello Neighbor is a sandbox stealth horror game that has you investigate your neighbor’s dark secrets. Finally, Observer is a cyberpunk game that has you investigate crimes by delving into your suspects’ fears.

The full Halloween Collection on Game Pass also includes Graveyard Keeper, State of Decay 2, Dead Rising 4, Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0, and more. In case those are all too scary for you, a kinder, cuter Halloween game is also available in Costume Quest 2.

Xbox Game Pass is a subscription-based service that gives you access to download more than 100 full Xbox One and Xbox 360 games. Microsoft adds new games each month, and it offers new first-party releases like Forza Horizon 4 to subscribers on the day of release. Other new additions for October include Wolfenstein: The New Order, Metro 2033 Redux, Westerado: Double Barreled, Lego Indiana Jones, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, and Split/Second.

The competition between subscription services appears to be heating up as well, because Sony recently expanded its own PlayStation Now program to allow game downloads.

If you read Ars Technica (or simply play online games regularly), you’re probably accustomed to game makers shutting down online gameplay servers at will, often with little-to-no notice. When it comes to the impending server shutdown for early PS3 release Warhawk, though, Sony seems to have actually broken its own long-standing promise regarding the timing of such a move.

Warhawk was one of Sony’s first experiments in online gaming, releasing in August of 2007, just months after the launch of the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Network. Over 11 years later, a handful of players still seem to be enjoying the online-only dogfight simulation, thanks in part to the game’s inclusion in Sony’s PlayStation Now streaming service. One player who talked to Ars described the active player base as running anywhere from several hundred to a couple thousand-strong, and nearly 400 people are still subscribed the Warhawk subreddit as of this writing.

On September 25, though, those remaining Warhawk players noticed a new message had appeared on the PlayStation Store page for the game. It warned:

If you read Ars Technica (or simply play online games regularly), you’re probably accustomed to game makers shutting down online gameplay servers at will, often with little-to-no notice. When it comes to the impending server shutdown for early PS3 release Warhawk, though, Sony seems to have actually broken its own long-standing promise regarding the timing of such a move.

I expect the system to be similar to what Playstation Now was originally marketed as; a streaming alternative to hardware backwards compatibility that allows you to keep playing at least the older generations of games that may not be that easy to find via legal options, while still being a surprisingly good deal. They may never go as far as one generation back, because hardware-wise that wouldn’t be very easy to implement without still including emulation hardware, thereby kinda defeating the point, but I could see going as far as GameCube games on the Switch. *maybe* Wii, but I doubt it. Subscription services are the way the gaming industry is going, and understand people not liking that and preferring “if I buy it, it’s mine forever” way of doing things. But for the majority of people, having unlimited access to every game in a catalog for a period of time at a reasonable price is a way better deal. It lets them try other games they would never have been willing to spend money on for risk of not liking it.",,KrazeeJ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

179460843475,10/26/2018,http://koragame.tumblr.com/post/179460843475,"Xbox Game Pass Will Expand To PC Microsoft has plans to expand the Game Pass subscription service from Xbox One to PC. CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mentioned during an earnings call that bringing Game Pass to PC will help increase the strength of the Xbox brand.Ars Technica reports that Nadella didn’t give any indication of when to expect the subscription to expand, or if it would be included within the same all-you-can-eat price as the Xbox version. It would make some sense for the service to be all-encompassing, given that its current “Play Anywhere” initiative has made PC and Xbox versions of games available across both platforms regardless of where you bought it.On the Xbox One, though, Game Pass has an isolated marketplace for such a service, competing only somewhat with the more niche EA Access. A PC subscription service would face competition from other similar monthly services at various price tiers. An Xbox One Game Pass subscription currently costs $10 a month. Expanding that pass to include PC games could come through an optional extra fee without paying for an entirely separate subscription.Microsoft made a bold play for Game Pass by announcing early this year that it would feature all first-party games, on the day of release. That has included big names like Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 4. The company also works with publishers to introduce a new slate of third-party Game Pass games every month, and the list is growing pretty large. It also made Game Pass part of its All Access plan, which bundles the console, Game Pass, and Xbox Live Gold together.Meanwhile, Sony appears to be keen on competing with Microsoft, changing its PlayStation Now service to allow players to download games. PlayStation Now had been a strictly streaming service, which Microsoft will be exploring in more depth next year with Project xCloud.

If you don't know anything about the PS3 then maybe do some reading. All throughout the PS3 lifecycle you had countless devs saying how awkward it was to dev for. PSNOW streams a PS3 hardware running the game. If they rebuilt the games to run on the PS4 then they'd work, but that'd cost time and money and so they'd just release them as remasters or ports and then people would moan about having to pay for these new versions of old games.",,dontreplytomeokay,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Right in the ad, it mentions the other things that come with Plus, so that's not a very good example. Finding other examples won't help either, because the point is that different people get different things out of it, which depends on what they want and need.

We got sidelined for Xbox originally which is why they accomplished so little in that time. Now we're being sidelined for Playstation. Now, with all of that in consideration, I would have to say no, our chances of DLC is extremely low and if we did get DLC it likely wouldn't even be worth the price because the last DLC took them 6 months to add so little and it's only been 2 months since then.

179339511606,10/23/2018,http://nikhilshakya5.tumblr.com/post/179339511606,"Xbox One Game Pass has updated with a few extra tricks and treats this month, adding some extra horror games to the library in honor of Halloween. These are all part of the “2Spooky for Halloween” promotion, which includes more than 20 spooky and scary games as part of Game Pass. The new additions are Dead Island: Riptide DE, Outlast, Hello Neighbor, and Observer.

Dead Island: Riptide takes you to the Banoi Archipelago to fight to survive a zombie apocalypse. The Definitive Edition features remastered access and grants access to all of the bonus content produced. Outlast is a first-person survival horror game that takes you into the heart of a creepy asylum reopened by a corporation with some questionable initiatives. Hello Neighbor is a sandbox stealth horror game that has you investigate your neighbor’s dark secrets. Finally, Observer is a cyberpunk game that has you investigate crimes by delving into your suspects’ fears.

The full Halloween Collection on Game Pass also includes Graveyard Keeper, State of Decay 2, Dead Rising 4, Resident Evil and Resident Evil 0, and more. In case those are all too scary for you, a kinder, cuter Halloween game is also available in Costume Quest 2.

Xbox Game Pass is a subscription-based service that gives you access to download more than 100 full Xbox One and Xbox 360 games. Microsoft adds new games each month, and it offers new first-party releases like Forza Horizon 4 to subscribers on the day of release. Other new additions for October include Wolfenstein: The New Order, Metro 2033 Redux, Westerado: Double Barreled, Lego Indiana Jones, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, and Split/Second.

The competition between subscription services appears to be heating up as well, because Sony recently expanded its own PlayStation Now program to allow game downloads.

179416402629,10/25/2018,http://thenewsguy.tumblr.com/post/179416402629,"As if the thought of the impending Steam sales for Autumn and Winter didn’t look set to make your PC gaming pile of shame threaten to topple over, Microsoft has just revealed its plans to bring its Xbox Game Pass subscription service to computers, too.

Xbox Game Pass is a $9.99 / £7.99 / AU$10.95 monthly subscription service that gives Xbox gamers access to more than 100 titles to play. These are downloaded to the console rather than streamed in from the cloud, and include access to Microsoft’s first-party titles on the same day they’re released for regular sale. Sony’s rival PlayStation Now service allows downloads of some games and streaming of others on the PlayStation 4 console, while PlayStation Now on PC only allows you to stream. 

Play (and download) anywhere

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced the platform addition as part of a financial year 2019 earnings call, but didn’t detail exactly when the launch would happen, nor how the PC counterpart would compare to the Xbox version.

However, it should be a relatively seamless transition, as Microsoft has been pushing its Play Anywhere initiative (where games are developed to be played across both PC and Xbox) heavily. 

Currently, Play Anywhere titles are included in the Xbox Game Pass, but not all Xbox Game Pass titles have the Play Anywhere feature. That’ll likely be the next step in getting Xbox Games Pass ready for PC consumption.

Microsoft also announced that a new Xbox Game Pass smartphone app is on the way, which will let gamers remotely manage their subscription and set titles to download even when they’re away from their consoles (or, presumably inevitably, their computers too).

179460782908,10/26/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/179460782908,"Microsoft has plans to expand the Game Pass subscription service from Xbox One to PC. CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mentioned during an earnings call that bringing Game Pass to PC will help increase the strength of the Xbox brand.

Ars Technica reports that Nadella didn’t give any indication of when to expect the subscription to expand, or if it would be included within the same all-you-can-eat price as the Xbox version. It would make some sense for the service to be all-encompassing, given that its current “Play Anywhere” initiative has made PC and Xbox versions of games available across both platforms regardless of where you bought it.

On the Xbox One, though, Game Pass has an isolated marketplace for such a service, competing only somewhat with the more niche EA Access. A PC subscription service would face competition from other similar monthly services at various price tiers. An Xbox One Game Pass subscription currently costs $10 a month. Expanding that pass to include PC games could come through an optional extra fee without paying for an entirely separate subscription.

Microsoft made a bold play for Game Pass by announcing early this year that it would feature all first-party games, on the day of release. That has included big names like Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 4. The company also works with publishers to introduce a new slate of third-party Game Pass games every month, and the list is growing pretty large. It also made Game Pass part of its All Access plan, which bundles the console, Game Pass, and Xbox Live Gold together.

Meanwhile, Sony appears to be keen on competing with Microsoft, changing its PlayStation Now service to allow players to download games. PlayStation Now had been a strictly streaming service, which Microsoft will be exploring in more depth next year with Project xCloud.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Xbox Game Pass Will Expand To PC,Post,,

Don't have one, as I have ZERO interest in this system. OK, then we get into the ""I dunno for sure"" about these. PSIO for the Playstation: Now, I heard about this WAY back, but the creators had a falling out...I don't even know. I've heard mixed things on it, but people complain about the software. What's the skinny? Anyone have one? PS3 Cobra: See Below I know the Phoebe guy is working on one for the PCE CD, but I honestly don't know if he's ever going to finish it. Are there any for the Gamecube? I know there aren't any for the Sega CD yet (so, I think). I love these things, with a passion. So, any being worked on? Any exciting news? I was hoping someone would come up with one for the PS2. I run games off the HDD, but it's not 100 percent. I'd prefer something better. ====================::==================== Quote: : Can anyone recommend a good hard drive to replace the one I have? I have a PS3 Slim. I'm almost out of room on it, as it is. I'm looking for a 1 TB. I know it has to be 2.5 SATA, and 5400RPM...but if someone could link me to one on Amazon or something, I'd appreciate it. I don't want to screw it up. A good brand like Western Digital or something would be good. EDIT: Would something like this be good? And would SSD make a difference in speed, on the PS3 like it does on PS4? https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital- ... ive%2C+ps3 Pretty much any 2.5"" SATA drive will work, and you're not limited to 5400rpm drives; a 7200rpm drive will work just fine, and might perform a little better than a 5400rpm disk. Hybrid disks like the one you link and the Seagate FireCudas will work as well, but their SSD cache is typically far too small to provide any noticeable benefit. SSDs will have the best performance, and they should result in a mild reduction in generated heat, but it won't necessarily feel like night and day like it is switching to an SSD on a PC, because [I believe] the PS3 only uses SATA1, which is always going to be a bottleneck. Seek times will pretty much be eliminated, and load times may improve, but don't get an SSD and expect amazing performance.

179411269466,10/25/2018,http://semakinmajuposts.tumblr.com/post/179411269466,"Jakarta - Microsoft mencatatkan peningkatan pemasukan dan keuntungan dalam laporan keuangan terbarunya, yang bisa dicapai berkat pertumbuhan bisnis cloud-nya.

 Dalam laporan keuangan Q1 tahun fiskal 2019 Microsoft ini, mereka mencatatkan pemasukan sebesar USD 29,1 miliar, dan keuntungan bersih sebesar USD 8,8 miliar atau di kisaran Rp 133,8 triliun. Berarti meningkat 19% dan 34% dibanding periode yang sama pada tahun sebelumnya.

 Pertumbuhan terbesar bisnis Microsoft berada pada sisi produk komersial seperti Office, yang pemasukannya tumbuh 17%, dan pemasukan Office 365 meningkat 36%. Sementara dari sisi cloud dan server, pemasukan Azure meningkat 76%, sementara produk server dan cloud secara total bertumbuh sebesar 28%.

 Pemasukan dari divisi Surface meningkat sebesar 14% secara year on year menjadi USD 1,1 miliar. Ini adalah laporan keuangan kuartal pertama Microsoft sejak mereka merilis tablet Surface Go Agustus lalu, yang menunjukkan kalau Surface kini adalah bisnis miliaran dolar.

  

  

 Microsoft pun kini masuk ke dalam lima besar pabrikan PC di Amerika Serikat berkat Surface. Menurut CFO Microsoft Amy Hood, pemasukan dari divisi Surface ini mayoritas didapat dari penjualan Surface Book 2 dan Surface Go.

 Sebenarnya, Microsoft juga mempunyai dua Surface anyar, yaitu Surface Pro 6 dan Surface Laptop 2. Namun kedua perangkat itu baru dijual pada Oktober, jadi pemasukannya baru bisa dihitung pada kuartal berikutnya, demikian dikutip dari The Verge, Kamis (25/10/2018).

 Selain itu, kini bisnis game Microsoft pun mulai tumbuh secara stabil dan pemasukannya meningkat 44% pada kuartal ini. Sementara pemasukan dari bisnis Xbox meningkat 94%, dan pengguna aktif Xbox Live kini tercatat 57 juta orang.

 “Menghadirkan (Xbox) Game Pass ke PC adalah bagian besar dari masa depan perusahaan untuk layanan Xbox,” ujar CEO Microsoft Satya Nadella.

 Microsoft pun baru-baru ini mengungkap rencananya untuk mulai masa percobaan layanan streaming game yang bernama xCloud pada 2019 mendatang. Dan layanan ini bakal mendapat persaingan kuat dari sejumlah layanan sejenis seperti GeForce Now, PlayStation Now, Shadow dan Liquid Sky.(asj/fyk)

RDR2 is an example of that. Look at the stark difference between Xbox One S and X. I know Xbox is doing what you’re explaining already and have started their intention of that strategy. PlayStation hasn’t but I expect them to follow suite. Backward and forwards compatibility is good for Microsoft and Sony. They don’t need hardware sales anymore. They need to sell their PSN/PSNow and Xbox Live/GamePass subscriptions. What I am saying is... expect consoles to act more like your phone. Incremental updates. Eventually, yes, hardware will become obsolete but not for generations and generations (in hardware terms).",,CaffeinatedCanuck,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,
