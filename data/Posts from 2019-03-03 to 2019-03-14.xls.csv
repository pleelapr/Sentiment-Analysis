It's a waste of money IMO. I'm not the biggest PS4 fan in the world but I do own one and I can see the value in it, particularly if you want a newest-generation system that will play the biggest # of games since everything multiplatform goes on PS4. But the *PS4 Pro* isn't enough of an upgrade to warrant the extra money IMO. Maybe it's just me saying this as someone who plays across multiple platforms though. If I wanted a powerhouse *console* I would go with the XB1X. It's much more powerful than the base XB1, and quite a bit more powerful than the PS4 Pro. It also is priced better and has better bundles and sales, whereas the PS4 Pro rarely gets decent sales. It also has backwards compatibility, which the PS4 does not, unless you want to pay $20/month for PSNow.",,caninehere,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

PlayStation Now: New Games for March 2019 Revealed





 PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming subscription service, which is designed for fans of the PlayStation family’s huge gaming catalog. Not to be confused with the PlayStation Plus membership club (which has its own separate library of playable titles), PlayStation Now allows users to stream and/or download a vast number of PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 games on either their PS4 or laptops.

In terms of pricing, the official PlayStation website will sell you a membership for $19.99 per month, $44.99 for three months, or $99.99 for the year. It is also possible, at the moment to try out the service with a 7-day free trial (if you can’t afford the payments, don’t forget to cancel your membership before the end of the trial period!). You can also pick up a membership on Amazon.

Each month, new games are added to the PlayStation Now library. Here’s what’s available this month:

Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots – PS3

In 2008, Solid Snake’s quest to stop the Sons of the Patriots AI and his brother, Liquid, came to a stunning conclusion in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, a game that blurred the lines between stealth-action gameplay and the cinematic. The result is a game that fuses the high intensity of a stealth game and the epic scope of an epic war movie. The writing is zany, the bosses are really spooky, and the twists are brain-numbing. If you love Hideo Kojima’s past Metal Gear work, this game is a must-play.



Dead Space 3 – PS3

This isn’t the Dead Space you’re used to. In fact, Dead Space 3 sheds much of the atmospheric horror that made the series infamous in the first place, instead focusing on action and co-op multiplayer gameplay. Now, the scarred, Necromorph-hunting Isaac can team up with a partner to take down the flesh-eating ghouls that are stalking the deepest corners of space. It’s a departure for sure, but if you can get past the threequel’s different flavor, Dead Space 3 is quite a bit of fun. 

PlayStation Now: Other New Games

A Bastard’s Tale (PS4)

Battlefield 4 (PS3)

Black Knight Sword (PS3)

Black Mirror (PS4)

Mirror’s Edge (PS3)

Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 (PS4)

NBA 2K18 (PS4)

Pool Nation (PS3)

Red Faction (PS2)

WWE 2K18 (PS4)

That’s all, folks! We’ll keep this list updated as Sony adds more games to PlayStation Now. Until then, check out what’s free this month on PlayStation Plus!",,shemo,Canada,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,PlayStation Now: New Games for March 2019 Revealed,Post,,

183428730385,3/13/2019,http://williamlingo.tumblr.com/post/183428730385,"Update, March 13, 2019 (11:05 AM ET): At a live Xbox and gaming event Microsoft held yesterday, Project xCloud got some stage time. The details of that event are in the hub below!

Original Article, February 1, 2019 (03:51 PM ET): The idea of being able to stream console and PC-quality games to any mobile device or platform has been mostly just a dream for awhile now. However, Microsoft recently announced it was trying to make turn that dream into reality with a new service called Project XCloud. In summary, it is supposed to be able to stream any game released for the Microsoft Xbox One console to smartphones and tablets, so owners can play them almost anywhere.

This is certainly ambitious, but if any company can accomplish this task, it’s Microsoft. Let’s take a look at everything we know currently about Project XCloud, compare it to other current and upcoming game streaming services, and see if Microsoft can pull off the dream of gaming anywhere at any time.

Editor’s Note: We will update this article on a regular basis when more information is revealed about Project xCloud.

What is Project xCloud?

Project xCloud is the current name (likely a placeholder) for Microsoft’s game streaming service. The company briefly announced plans to offer such a service in June 2018 as part of its press event at the E3 video game trade show. We know the company has been working on technology to stream games from cloud servers to smartphones and other devices for years. In September 2013, The Verge reported Microsoft showed off a demo at an internal meeting featuring the Xbox 360-exclusive game Halo 4 streaming from the cloud to both a Windows Phone-based Nokia Lumia smartphone and a Windows PC.

In October 2018, Microsoft revealed more information on its game streaming service, along with the Project xCloud code name. The announcement was accompanied by a video showing what Microsoft said was footage of live game streaming from this service. We saw players with Samsung smartphones and tablets playing popular games like Forza Horizon 4, Gears of War 4, Halo 5, and Cuphead with both Xbox One game controllers and, in the case of the tablets, actual direct control on touchscreens.

In both its blog post and the video, Microsoft said Project xCloud would leverage the features of the company’s Azure cloud computing hardware and software, which is available in 54 locations all over the world. The company said it is already testing Project xCloud from an Azure cloud server located in Washington. Microsoft says it has created a special cloud server blade to hold the hardware of several Xbox One consoles. Each of these Project xCloud blades can be placed in Azure data centers around the world. Microsoft says when the service officially goes live, it should offer gamers a great streaming experience everywhere.

As we stated, the video showed gamers controlling the streaming games on smartphones via the Xbox One game controller, connected by wireless Bluetooth tech. However, Microsoft says it has also developed a “touch input overlay” to play Xbox One games direction on a smartphone or tablet’s touchscreen, without the need for a controller.

During the Inside Xbox episode on March 12, 2019, Kareem Choudhry, head of gaming cloud at Microsoft, gave us another sneak peek into Project xCloud. Live on stage, the exec brought out an Android phone connected to an Xbox One controller and Inside Xbox host Julia Hardy used it to play Forza Horizon 4. The game looked fluid and crisp — although there’s no telling what kind of behind-the-scenes trickery may have been employed to ensure a smooth demo.

Microsoft says it has been testing Project xCloud internally, with download speeds of 10Mbps. It claims when the service will not only work on current 4G cellular networks when it goes live, but also the upcoming 5G networks scheduled to go live in 2019. The company added it knows it will need to address number of issues for this service to work well, like solving issues with latency, graphical quality in games and playable framerates for those titles. So far, Microsoft has not yet offered any specifics on how they plan to deal with these issues.

Microsoft claims when Project xCloud launches, it will support streaming of every single Xbox One game that’s been published, or will be in the future. In addition, developers will be able to let gamers access their Xbox One games via Project xCloud with no additional work on their end.

When will Project xCloud launch and what will it cost?

Microsoft has confirmed it will begin public trials of Project xCloud sometime in 2019. It has not yet stated where in the world the trials will take place. It did say the trials will test the service with “different volumes and locations.” Microsoft has not announced if it will charge any money for accessing the public trials. It has also not announced a target date for the launch of the full service.

Microsoft will reveal more information on Project xCloud during a presentation at the Game Developers Conference, which will be held in San Francisco in mid-March.

What smartphones and tablets will work with Project xCloud?

Microsoft 

While Microsoft has not announced any official Project xCloud support for specific platforms and devices, the demo video showed the service on Samsung-based phones and tablets. It’s a safe bet Microsoft will launch Project XCloud for Samsung and other Android-based mobile devices. However, support for Apple’s iPhone and iPad products might be a bit more difficult.

Earlier this year, Valve launched its Steam Link app for Android, which allows people who have a PC and a Steam account to stream games locally in their own home to a mobile phone or tablet. However, when Valve tried to launch the same Steam Link app for iOS, it was blocked from the iOS Appstore by Apple, for apparently violating the store’s guidelines. So far, Valve’s Steam Link app has yet to appear on iOS, and if it stays off that app store, it’s likely any Project XCloud app from Microsoft would also be banned by Apple.

Are there any current and future competitors to Project xCloud?



The concept of a game streaming service, similar to how Netflix and Hulu stream videos and Spotify streams music, is nothing new but, it’s proven very hard to launch.  The closest we have come to something similar to Microsoft’s plans for Project xCloud has come from Nvidia. Its GeForce Now service allows owners of its Android-based Shield tablets (original and K1), the Shield Portable console and its Shield TV set-top boxes to purchase and stream a selection of high-quality PC games to those devices. Nvidia has since expanded the scope of GeForce Now to include support for people who own games via Steam to stream their selections to Shield TV boxes, along with beta testing for Windows and Mac computers. So far, Nvidia has not revealed how many people have signed up to use GeForce Now in any of its incarnations.

In addition to Nvidia’s efforts, Sony offers its PlayStation Now service. Launched in 2014, the service now has more than 650 PS2, PS3 and PS4 games to stream for a monthly fee. However, Sony cut support for PlayStation Now for a number of previously included devices, including smart TVs and the PlayStation Vita portable in 2017. It now works just on PlayStation 4 consoles and Windows PCs. Like NVIDIA, Sony has chosen not to announce just how many gamers have used PlayStation Now in the past four years.

Google 

In October, Google joined the game streaming trend with the rather bland sounding “Project Stream” code name. It launched an invite-only beta allowing members of the public to stream and play the full version of Ubisoft’s action-adventure game Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey on laptops, desktop PCs, and Chromebooks with the Chrome browser, if they have an internet connection 25 Mbps or faster. Ironically, Google is not launching such a test for Android-based smartphones and tablets. The test is scheduled to end in January 2019. So far, Google has not officially announced plans to expand “Project Stream” beyond this small test period.

Electronic Arts 

Finally, game publisher Electronic Arts revealed in June at the E3 trade show it was working on its own game streaming service, even showing live demos of it running on smartphones. EA had previously announced it had acquired the cloud gaming technology assets and personnel of the GameFly service for an undisclosed amount. Since E3, EA has been silent about its plans for its own game streaming service.

Conclusion



Microsoft’s Project xCloud announcement could be the biggest hope yet for game streaming technology. Microsoft certainly has both game experience with their Xbox division and a ton of cloud server technology development to help in their plans to successful launch Project xCloud. However, we have seen promising game-oriented technology at Microsoft crash and burn before (we are looking at you, Kinect). It remains to be seen if Project xCloud will be a true revolution for the portable and mobile game industry, or just another streaming service that fails to live up to its potential.

What are your impressions of Microsoft’s Project xCloud at this point? Do you think the company will be successful in bringing game streaming to the masses or are there too many technically hurdles to overcome at this point? Let us know your thoughts in the comments!

You can have 0 latency. No, you're always going to have at least _some_ network latency with a network. That's intrinsic to a network. It's just a matter of how much. >The issue is that there aren't any physical servers for them to connect to in their own country, so they get connected to the Korean servers. You can have the fastest internet in the world, and amazing hardware rendering the ""video"" you keep claiming to know about, but if the server isn't outputting properly, It's not a matter of ""outputting properly"", but rather a matter of how much time it takes to get from the home to the server and back from the server to the home. Sure, distance between the home and server greatly affect this, but unless the server is located within your own home's LAN, the added latency will probably be perceptible, even if it's not enough to ruin the experience. > which PSNow currently does. I've used PSNow before (with a low latency connection), and while the latency was _tolerable_, the input lag of playing locally is definitely preferable. >I can claim to have a background in CS too. That doesn't do anything for anyone here when you're missing the entire point of needing physical hardware near you. That didn't seem to be your point at the beginning, when you started by saying, ""Can you watch netflix in hd? You’ll be fine unless you need to play counterstrike with a mouse and keyboard"". That doesn't sound like you're saying, ""Server location affects latency,"" but rather, ""If you have enough bandwidth for Netflix, you won't have any issues with game streaming."" I understand very well how server location affects latency. I never said otherwise. My point has been that if your game is being rendered remotely, the latency between you and the server is much more critical than for streaming video or playing online games rendered locally.",,jm0112358,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I’m really new to this and want to enjoy some of this gaming with my wife...Thanks Again... In this case you almost certainly want the PS4 Pro. This is a great article comparing the baseline versions (PS4 vs. Xbox One S): https://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-vs-ps4,review-2543.html It doesn't sound like you are currently a PC gamer who would benefit from the increased synergy between PC and Xbox One with things like its Play Anywhere initiative; meaning any of the games in that link you already purchased digitally for Windows on your PC you could already play for free on your TV in your living room with the Xbox One without having to purchase them again. XB1 also integrates better with PC peripherals like mice and keyboards. If you used to be an Xbox gamer and have a large library of old Xbox 360 (and even some original Xbox) games the Xbox One would also probably be preferred due to superior backwards compatibility. It's free. You can play all your old games. Sony wants to charge you $20/mo or $99/yr for their streaming PSNow service to play old games, and streaming from the cloud still isn't as stable, reliable, or convenient as playing from an old disc. But I don't recall seeing you in this subforum discussing old Xbox 360 or Xbox games. The lone advantage I might see for you for the Xbox One is as a media center. If you don't have a 4K Blu-Ray player this is a strong plus for the Xbox. It's flat out better all-around. Tom's Guide said: For sheer options, Xbox One is the superior entertainment machine. The system has the unique ability to transmit your cable box's TV signal, allowing you to quickly switch between playing a game and watching a show. The Xbox One S, Xbox One X and PS4 Pro can all stream 4K content, but only Microsoft's consoles can play 4K Blu-rays. Unlike PS4, Xbox One supports Dolby Atmos, allowing folks with compatible home theater products to enjoy immersive spatial sound, and will soon support Dolby Vision for improved HDR quality. The Xbox One is also the only console that features Kodi, a highly popular media server app that lets you access any movies, TV shows, images or songs you have stored on any of your devices around the house. Other than that, both PS4 and Xbox One cover most entertainment essentials, from major apps like Netflix and Hulu to more niche stuff like WWE Network and Crunchyroll. PS4 and Xbox One both offer Spotify, which lets you rock out to tunes in the background of whatever you're playing. Xbox One features a few other notable music services such as SoundCloud, Pandora and Deezer. Both consoles make it easy to cut cable. PS4 offers Sony's own PlayStation Vue online TV service (starting at $40 a month), which features lots of major cable channels, such as MTV and Nickelodeon; a slick interface; and a nearly limitless DVR. Xbox One owners have access to Sling TV, a similar online TV service that offers top networks such as ESPN and AMC for $20 a month, with add-on packages that bring in the likes of Epix and HBO. Even if you don't have cable or Sling, Xbox One has the ability to receive basic over-the-air live TV, as long as you have a separate antenna and adapter handy. The PS4 exclusive library crushes the Xbox One exclusive library, especially with action/adventure games, or any type of single player games (i.e. not online competitive multiplayer). For example, two of the three best AAA games of the past year were PS4 exclusives. Red Dead Redemption was multi-platform, but God of War and Marvel's Spider-Man were PS4 exclusives, and God of War won almost all the Game of the Year awards this past year. This has been true every year since launch. If you were big into competitive online shooters that is where the Xbox One shines because those are almost all multiplat, but you specifically said that isn't your thing. This is the best resource to compare exclusives: https://gematsu.com/exclusives/ps4 https://gematsu.com/exclusives/xbox-one God of War Marvel's Spider-Man Horizon: Zero Dawn Bloodborne The Last of Us II (upcoming) The Last of Us: Remastered Uncharted 4: A Thief's End Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection The Last Guardian Ratchet & Clank The Order: 1886 Until Dawn Persona 5 Detroit: Become Human inFAMOUS: Second Son Undertale",,Madmick,United States of America,California,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

There are XBL games on mobile. Minecraft is on PS4. Crossplay with all devices. Xbox Store/Games/Accounts on Win10. Xbox Play Anywhere. They have said in both shareholders calls and at press events. If you're playing Microsoft games on any platform, they're happy with that. You're logged into Xbox services. Even the Microsoft Theatre in LA is being rebranded to Xbox Theatre.

Microsoft is far ahead in this game with Azure. The Xbox console isn't where Xbox lives and dies anymore.",,Born2beSlicker,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

How is xCloud doing anything more complicated than a thin client????? Who’s the one assuming xCloud is more “complicated” than a thin client?? As it stands now MS is doing the exact thing Sony did 5 years ago in 2014 by putting blade servers made of its last gen devices up basically rdp into them. MS is only claiming public betas in 2019, not launch. It could be 2020 by the time the service launches and based on their own strategy of putting XB1 servers in the cloud it would be eerily similarly to what Sony did with PSNow at launch, again 5 years ago. MS is attempting to vary the processing load depending on the relative power of the client accessing the service, I know you know this as well because you've stated you don't think it can/will work. I don't work for Sony, MS, or Google, I can only go by what I've read about them. I'm glad that somebody is attempting something different with streaming, because the limited time I had with PSNow was mediocre at best, and streaming NEEDS to improve if in fact the industry goes that route. MS has only briefly talked about it's ""splices"" or slices however this has some VERYhard implications for both Developers and their games. The ""splicing"" technology refers to having segments of the game processed locally. Which can take several forms, but the most common is that it would download the initial game engine (which can be several gigs by itself) and rough wireframe with hitboxes and physics is rendered locally (which can also be processor intensive). The problem with that is that it requires the client to have the processing power to actually run the game engine and physics meaning either your ENTIRE GAME ACROSS ALL SYSTEMS is downgraded to run on the lowest common denominator or you do what Google and PSNow are doing anyway and render the entire game remotely. There is no way to get around the technical mechanics of modern games unless you want a game with crappy play mechanics but ""looks next-gen"". And that's why we have to read past the marketing speak everytime Microsoft starts talking to us like we are idiots. It's feeling like kinect, always online, power of the cloud all over again. They assume their audience doesn't have a fundamental understanding of how computers or networks work and talk about things that aren't realistic because they don't realize that anyone with two brain cells to rub together knows you can't run high level PC/Console physics locally on the free Cricket android phone you get for signing up... This doesn't even take into account the added development and cost complexity of attempting to split your game out like that and then determine which devices which splices are able to run on. But ignoring all of that, the burden of proof remains on Microsoft who have yet to give a hands on to the general public. I'm certainly open to seeing a better way to do game streaming and if Microsoft is claiming their way is ""better"" just like they did with Kinect and ""Power of the Cloud"" then they need to prove it to everyone and not just have On-stage announcements. Google had their streaming service out in the wild. Sony technically has been letting gamers stream games over the internet for 13 years now. They had PS3 to PSP remote play over the internet back in 2016. I'm not asking for MS to do a fancy presentation, I'm asking them to put up their solution if they claim they have the best solution. The fact is, they've shown us nothing but the above play video. But they had a fancy presentation.... while their competitors put controllers in gamers hands.",,michaelmikado,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

What happens when a lot of smaller studios have been snapped up by Microsoft or EA, who also has their own game library with EA/Origin Access? These studios don't just pop up out of nowhere, especially if you are looking for studios in the AA space which is what a good deal of what Microsoft has been acquiring. Studios capable of making meaty experiences that can satisfy players on a streaming service and keep them subscribed as more new stuff comes along. PSNow does not compete with Game Pass directly, it's far inferior but manages to make more revenue because of its higher price + bigger install base on the PS4. But if Game Pass becomes successful, and Microsoft has bought up a lot of the promising AA devs - where is Sony left then? Yes, they have a streaming service, but not enough content to put on it - and that would even be assuming they they would make a move to match what Microsoft is offering (new games on Day 1 on their library service).",,caninehere,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

All signs point to a Google game console announcement at GDC



Enlarge / A (not serious) artist’s conception of what Google’s gaming hardware might look like.

Ron Amadeo / Apple

Normally, Google showing up to the Game Developers Conference isn’t a huge deal. The company does this pretty much every year—Android smartphones and Google Play are a pretty big gaming platform, after all—and it shows up with livestreams and blog posts and all the usual festivities. This year, though, is different. Google has been sending out vague teasers since last month for a GDC event, but as the date approaches, the company has been dropping more and more hints of exactly what it is announcing: Google is launching video game hardware for the Project Stream platform.

A new YouTube video for the event posted today asks people to “Gather around as we unveil Google’s vision for the future of gaming at GDC19.” Google recently wrapped up the “Project Stream” beta test, which streamed a full version of Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey from the internet to any desktop version of Chrome. A game streaming platform certainly fits a vision for the future of gaming, but this is still just a piece of software.

Google Hardware

There are two big pieces of evidence that this is a hardware announcement. First, Google is a heavily compartmentalized company, and the person promoting this event on Twitter is none other than Risk Osterloh, Google’s Senior Vice President of Hardware. Osterloh is behind the division that brought us the Pixel phone, Google Home, and every other Google hardware product. His involvement is a solid sign that, yes, new hardware is coming.

We are going to talk about the future of gaming! You can watch it live on 3/19 at 10AM PDT → https://t.co/L7tIKMW7HF

— Rick Osterloh (@rosterloh) March 12, 2019

The second big piece of evidence is that Google is also hosting a teaser page on store.google.com. The Google Store. The Google Hardware Store. Google could host a teaser page at any of its thousands of sub-domains, but for some mysterious reason, it picked the Google Store. The “Google Store” doesn’t sell software—that would be “Google Play.” The Google Store only sells hardware—things like smartphones and tablets and laptops and Google Home speakers. Soon, apparently, it will sell video game hardware.

According to a report from The Information (subscription required), Google’s gaming hardware was reportedly codenamed “Yeti” and has been in the works at Google for over three years now. We can only guess at what Google gaming hardware might look like. In 2014, the company co-designed the Google Nexus Player with Asus, which was a dead simple combination of some smartphone parts in a disk-shaped box, a TV remote, and a generic, Xbox-style game controller. That device was primarily an Android TV box, but a game streaming console could look similar to this.

There was also this Google patent of a generic-looking game controller, that made the news rounds the other day. The patent involved pushing notifications to the controller, which could be interesting, and the drawings show Android-y hardware buttons—home, menu, and microphone—presumably for Google voice commands. The controller also acted as your authentication token, storing user information like your Google account and settings, and using a button combination as a password. This patent was from 2014, though, so it’s hard to know if it is at all relevant. Companies patent every single idea they have, and random patents aren’t necessarily indicative of future plans.

Another option is just to use the Google Chromecast. The Information’s Yeti report noted that “an early version” of Project Stream originally ran on Google’s existing streaming stick, just with a controller paired to it. At the time we didn’t know of a way to pair a controller to a Chromecast, since the devices didn’t support Bluetooth or any other way to hook up a controller. Months later, a third-generation Chromecast started showing up in stores, packing—wouldn’t you know it—Bluetooth. As far as we know, there is no official explanation for the new Chromecast’s Bluetooth support. So maybe Rick Osterloh will walk up on stage at GDC, hold up a game controller, and say “Anyone that bought a Chromecast in the last six months now owns the Google game console.” Mic drop, exit stage right.

Google infrastructure

Enlarge / The internet is a series of tubes—like these cooling pipes in Google’s Oregon data center.

Numerous companies have tried game streaming in the past, most notably Sony with the PlayStation Now and Nvidia with Geforce Now. Microsoft is jumping into the game with “Project Xcloud,” which is powered by literal Xboxes acting as blade servers. Sony and Microsoft both have existing traditional console businesses to safeguard, though, and Nvidia wants to sell graphics cards. Google is the only gaming newcomer that doesn’t have an existing business to protect.

While Google isn’t a gaming powerhouse, it is an internet infrastructure powerhouse. This could come in handy for a game streaming service, which is heavily dependent on network performance and shipping video around the world. Google, of course, runs some of the most popular sites on the web, including Google.com and YouTube, the latter of which is one of the biggest bandwidth users on the internet. Google’s pioneering data center work is one of the key reasons site like YouTube can afford to exist. Google has constantly worked to make the web cheaper, faster, and lower latency, and today the company has a hand in pretty much every aspect of the internet, from browsers to ISPs to protocols to fiber backbone. If Google really wants to invest in making low latency game streaming a reality, there is plenty it can bring to the table.

Google… Games?



Having a hardware and a streaming platform is nice,  but it doesn’t matter one bit if you don’t have any games to play. A Kotaku report from the middle of a last year said Google was pursuing “aggressive recruiting or even major acquisitions” in the games industry to try to build a library for its gaming platform.

There’s a good chance the former Xbox and PlayStation executive Phil Harrison was involved in those negotiations, as Google hired him at the beginning of 2018. Another big hire was just announced recently: Google snapped up former Ubisoft and EA executive Jade Raymond. Raymond will be VP of an undisclosed division at Google. It sounds like she’s not allowed to talk about it right now.

Google’s press conference is March 19 at 10am Pacific.

1. Don’t mock Google’s gaming hardware, it’s only a mockup

We know Google is hard at work on Project Stream. But the latest news might be more fake news than anything else.

First, let’s take a look:



The news:

 * The above renders of Google’s Project Stream game controller were published over the weekend, the perfect time to lead a frenzy of pretty underwhelmed reactions that spread like wildfire. 
 * Ugly/bad/painful/uninspiring were the general themes. And fair enough, it ain’t pretty. That controller does not spark joy. 
 * But but but… this isn’t the coming Google controller at all, just mocked-up renders based on Google patent filings. 
 * That patent was a recently published game controller patent from Google, which actually boils down to a patent on a gaming notification system, working between a gaming controller and a gaming system. 
 * The 2019 patent filing extends from a 2014 patent, and did come with some interesting images attached, such as the below design: 


 * So that diagram led to the “reveal” of the renders which then led to the vortex of news and views ahead of time. 
 * We know by now that just about all patents featured technical images rather than anything based on true industrial design or materials. 
 * And I mean, Google might still release an awful game controller. That is its prerogative. The internet and everyone can react when that happens. 
 * But we haven’t really seen what might be coming from Project Stream. Just diagrams. (And the diagram is somehow much nicer than the render anyway?) 
 * Moving on! 
Project Stream and the coming revolution in gaming:



 * While we’re here, a refresher and quick dive into the future: we’re on the cusp of the next major disruption in entertainment. 
 * And, therefore, a disruption in attention, money, hardware, software, platforms, game controllers… 
 * Project Stream is Google’s not-so-secret service that it hopes will lead it to successfully disrupt gaming by creating a device that can play games via streams, rather than via local hardware. 
 * It works by allowing you to play any game on any platform via cloud servers, near your location, via a single hardware device. 
 * Rather than playing on your own device, such as your classic LED-lit gaming PC, your gaming device is a connection to the cloud, which is running dedicated hardware. 
 * You pay a subscription each month for this access, rather than own depreciating hardware, and stream at high-quality 1080p/60fps. 
 * It relies on fast transfers of data with almost zero latency, which seems extremely unlikely if you recall dial-up modem days weren’t that long ago. 
 * But it’s already working, although it won’t work for the entire population just yet, given it relies on network infrastructure. 
 * We saw a Project Stream technical test that ran for several months, allowing tested to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in a Chrome browser tab. 
The competition is fierce already:

 * Now, this is already a thing and companies are arming up in the space, fighting to become the “Netflix for gaming” winner. 
 * The cost for entry is strong software and a link to speedy hardware. (And starting a data center is not cheap – as Hemant Mohapatra recently explained). 
 * So who’s on the playing field? 
 * Sony’s PlayStation Now is live for 650+ older games but is a more average experience, despite Sony’s early moves here with acquisitions of Gaikai (2012) and OnLive (2015). 
 * (It’s about where I thought gaming-on-demand would get to before we had a major 5G rollout for both wireless and fixed data.) 
 * Other offerings have been much smoother. 
 * GeForce Now from NVIDIA supports more than 400 games and is surprisingly good. 
 * Microsoft, the home of Xbox, has Project xCloud announced, aiming for a 2020 release. 
 * Nintendo has an offering on the Switch already, but only in Japan for now. 
 * Amazon, which owns gaming powerhouse Twitch, is working on a service due in 2020, and has the benefit of its AWS infrastructure. 
 * Verizon has Verizon Gaming in the works. 
 * EA is working on helping developers create games for a streaming-first world. 
 * There’s also the Shadow device from Blade which offers a full PC device, streamed from the cloud, with gaming. 
What’s next?

 * Google’s Game Developer Conference is happening from March 18th, with a “Google reveal” scheduled for March 19th. 
 * We’ll know more – including, potentially, what the actual controller might look like – then! 
2. Android Q’s first developer preview could arrive later today (Android Authority).

3. Hold onto your hats: Tesla announces it won’t close retail stores and will go back and raise prices on its cars that it slashed (Tesla). (No change to $35,000 Model 3, no price hike until March 18th. Chaos! All ahead of the big March 14th Model Y reveal.)

4. Foursquare wants to know how creepy you think its new ‘Hypertrending’ feature is (9to5Mac)

5. The other smartphone business: Out of the shadow of Android (TechCrunch).

6. How the internet travels across oceans: ‘People think that data is in the cloud, but it’s not. It’s in the ocean.’ (NYTimes) – A very nice interactive feature.

7. Over a quarter of US adults now own a smart speaker, with 60% owning an Amazon Echo (Voicebot.ai).

8. ICYMI: Elizabeth Warren proposes breaking up tech giants (NYTimes)

9. Quantum radio! A new quantum circuit picks up infinitesimal radio signals, may open up new opportunities in radio astronomy and medical imaging (TUDelft).

10. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed again in a tragedy that poses serious questions for Boeing (Reuters). China’s aviation regulator has grounded nearly 100 Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by its airlines.

11. Twitter account asks the all-important video game question: Can you pet the dog? (Kotaku).

Mass Effect 2 wasn’t a 360 exclusive...it was on PS3 and PC as well. It is an awesome next generation exclusive though. Check your PS4 ready to install and see if it’s there. It’s on PlayStation Now which means it’s not an exclusive... Nice! I wasnt aware i could play the physical copy I have for PS3 on my PS4.

183251238267,3/5/2019,http://igotpenandtagon.tumblr.com/post/183251238267,"With about three months to go before E3 2019, Xbox rumours are already heating up. Microsoft has previously confirmed it is working on multiple new Xbox consoles, and now its plans appear to be coming into focus.

There is a lot of information out there about the new Xbox consoles, so we’re rounding up all the rumours and speculation into this post to help make sense of the matter. Bear in mind that while the sources for each rumour have proven reliable in the past, everything mentioned here is unconfirmed, and as with all rumours, plans are subject to change. Microsoft’s official stance is that it does not comment on rumour and speculation. With that caveat out of the way…

A Disc-Free Xbox One

Rumoured for many months already, and discussed at a conceptual level for years, the disc-free Xbox One is said to be codenamed Xbox Maverick. Windows Central reported that this system will actually be called “Xbox One S All-Digital Edition.” Pre-orders for the console are said to open in April, with the console then scheduled to go on sale in May around the world.

This would be a first for Microsoft, as all previous Xbox hardware featured a disc drive. Pricing hasn’t been mentioned in any reports yet, but dropping the disc drive would presumably lower the cost. In fact, it’s believed that the disc-free Xbox One would be the cheapest Xbox One offering to date.

Also unclear at this stage is if the disc-free Xbox One would contain any further changes to the Xbox One hardware or design. WindowsCentral posted a Photoshopped mock-up of what an Xbox One without a disc drive might look like–check it out here.

The video game industry, like film, TV, and music before it, is increasingly trending toward the digital space and away from physical media. Microsoft itself is pushing further into the digital space with its new streaming service Project xCloud, which according to Brad Sams, will enter a trial phase later this year. Another Microsoft digital subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, is proving popular already with millions of people signing up. It’s clear digital is important to Microsoft going forward.

All-digital hardware has been attempted before, as Sony launched the PSP Go back in 2009–but it failed. It’s been a decade since that trial, and general internet availability and speed has improved since then. Still, there are parts of the world where access to internet is limited, and other places where speeds are less-than-great (hello, Australia!). For those who prefer physical media, Microsoft will continue to make Xbox One consoles with disc-drives, so there is no need to worry about an all-digital future taking over, at least not yet.

The Disc-To-Digital Program

A key component of Microsoft’s disc-free Xbox One plans is what’s being referred to as the “disc-to-digital” program. As part of this, users can trade in their console discs for a digital license for games they already own. The disc-to-digital program is expected to launch around the same time as the disc-free Xbox One console’s release in May, or a little earlier, Brad Sams reported. People will be able to visit the Microsoft Store and Best Buy (and potentially others) to swap their discs for digital licenses. The specifics about how this will work remain unclear.

Retailers might not be very happy about this news, especially GameStop, whose “buy-sell-trade” business model hinges on physical media remaining popular. But no one is asking players to care about the health of retailers; if this is the way the business is going, retailers will need to adapt. For its part, GameStop has diversified its offerings substantially of late to focus more on digital options and physical content like Funko Pop! toys and other physical merchandise.

A New Fortnite Xbox One

Microsoft already offers an Xbox One hardware bundle that comes with Fortnite and various extras, but the company is reportedly planning to push even further on the battle royale game. A new Xbox One featuring a design inspired by Fortnite is coming, according to Windows Central, though the site didn’t have any further information about the system and if it will be an Xbox One S, X, or the new disc-free edition.

Next-Gen Consoles

Microsoft is reportedly working on multiple new Xbox One consoles in development under the “Scarlett” umbrella. The first is codenamed Anaconda, according to Brad Sams, and is the new high-power Xbox One to follow the Xbox One X that was released in November 2017. The other, codenamed Lockhart, is said to be the budget-oriented offering.

At E3 2019 in June, Microsoft is expected to discuss both of these consoles, though it’s unclear at this stage how deep into specifics the company plans to get. Sams reported that Microsoft’s idea with the new consoles is to “make next-gen gaming available to wider audiences with a lower price of entry.” The consoles aren’t expected to be released until Fall 2020.

According to Sams, the Anaconda console will be priced in line with Sony’s PlayStation 5 (which is rumoured but hasn’t been announced yet), while Lockhart will cost less.

Specs are unknown for Anaconda and Lockhart, but Sams reported that both consoles will have solid-state storage, which would be a big improvement over the Xbox One X’s hard disk drive.

Sams speculates that specs for the new wave of consoles is expected to not be as important as it was with the Xbox One X, a console that can already deliver 4K/60FPS gaming. He suggests that the most significant change will be on the software side. A new technology called GameCore OS will enable Microsoft to bring Xbox One and PC development more closely together, apparently.

According to Sams, Microsoft may attempt to launch GameCore OS for all of the Xbox One family of devices. However, it’s unknown at this stage if this will unlock what Sams called “true forward and backwards compatibility.”

With Microsoft said to be pushing more into the PC development space (Halo Infinite is coming to Xbox One and PC), some may question if this will hurt Microsoft’s ability to sell consoles. As Sams reminds us, games–not hardware–is where the money is made. The margin profile of game sales are known to be better than hardware, where margins are low or even non-existent in some cases in history.

“That is not where you make money,” Phil Spencer told GeekWire about consoles. “The business inside of games is really selling games, and selling access to games and content in means like that is the fundamental business. So if you open it up, the more often people can play, the more they’re enjoying the art form. It increases the size of the business.”

xCloud And Game Pass

One of Microsoft’s most exciting and ambitious new technologies is the game-streaming service Project xCloud. Microsoft’s long-term vision is to bring Xbox to every internet-connected screen, whether that be a TV, console, or the mobile phone in your pocket. According to Sams, xCloud–or whatever name Microsoft decides to give it–will enter the trial phase later this year. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said that, during his holiday travels at the end of 2018, he was already playing streaming games on his phone as he jetted around, so it’s definitely coming together.

Nothing is certain yet, but it’s not hard to envision a future where Xbox Game Pass becomes an xCloud offering where people can stream games wherever they are, on whatever device they have. That’s exciting to think about. But there are numerous unanswered questions like whether the service will be available worldwide (PlayStation Now is notably unavailable in Australia), and if it will require Xbox Live Gold or not. Whatever the case, it may finally be time that streaming takes off, as Microsoft is joined by the likes of Google, Amazon, Verizon, and other tech juggernauts in having announced or rumoured to have game-streaming services in the pipeline.

Next Steps

Brad Sams reports that Microsoft will begin to discuss its next-generation plans with partners at the Game Developers Conference later this month in San Francisco. The show is aimed at developers and business executives, so whether or not these discussions take place behind-closed-doors or publicly remains to be seen. At the consumer-facing E3 show in June, the company will reportedly formally unveil the new consoles and discuss its plans at a high level.

The context, if you bothered to actually follow the thread was that residential doesn't ""need"" gigabit now or in the near future. Again, residential wireline bandwidth availability is increasingly exceeding actual throughput. Just because you get bumped from 100Mb to 200Mb doesn't mean you find use for it. You get to the point where you are far, far ahead of the ""killer"" app that would use it. 5G's benefit, which is the mobile context, for users will come from low latency which would enable ""wired"" type storage performance on mobile and snappier performance, not from ultra high per-user bandwidth capacity. WTF are you going to do with Gb on mobile that could not be done at 50Mb? Exactly nothing. Bring wireline latency and overall higher network capacity to mobile and it opens doors for a lot of new capabilities. You enable more software as a service capability and ultimately hardware as a service (which makes the mobile device as a terminal) as is already the case with remote desktop, PSNow and MS xCloud which are all hardware as a service. Really, these simple concepts should not be so difficult for you to follow.",,Economist,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Re: To Everyone who said nobody needs gigabit:,,,

Anyhow my whole use case for the Xperia Play was retro gaming with so many emulators on Android you game catalog was huge. You could play any n64, ps1 and any other Gen prior. Plus you had that thing to map any controls to TouchPad even back then so any android game worked toom. Even games like final fantasy 7, Persona something where you just click to attack even those games are so much better with a controller. It was so convenient to just pull out a xperia play slide open the gamepad and start playing anywhere. No hassle with add on controllers no side mount controllers and no oversized smartphone so it fit in the pocket comfortably. It was easy and simple and you only had to ever carry one device. I tried moving to a Bluetooth controller and android smartphone but it was a nightmare to set the phone down somewhere and remember to carry a controller around. The razer 1 isn't a full on gaming phone but it was close. The asus rog gaming phone was even closer that one has a 1ms response time btw. Those are good phones but you're right they don't offer anything that's not on any flagship right now. Though a slide out gamepad phone similar to an Xperia Play does offer sooooooo much more and with stuff like remote play and psnow (is that dead I dunno) and also the steam remote play you would kinda have an ultimate phone in your pocket.",,sfex3champion,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Game streaming is beginning to look like a fairly viable alternative to traditional console or PC gaming for those with tighter budgets.

But I think you’re not quite considering how it might be used *without* replacing normal play. And before I get into examples, let me explain why I’m giving this theory: It’s to try to fit the data. https://m.ign.com/articles/2018/11/08/playstation-now-is-more-popular-thank-you-think PlayStation Now had more subscriber revenue in Q3 2018 than every other major subscription service on the market put together. As a service, it’s primarily marketed at people who already own a PlayStation. Even people who subscribe for use on PC need to buy a DualShock controller to use it. So it’s pretty clear the target market is not just for people who have never bought any gaming-capable devices. Even though they added download features, that was midway through the quarter and doesn’t apply to all games. So we can take a look and think about why this system might be popular even for someone who already owns a gaming PC. *These* reasons might be wrong; but they are still based on my own trialling of both PSN and GeForce Now. - They let players try out a game instantly with no setup time. - It’s an easy way to access games that have not been ported to their owner console (the main games not available for download) - When traveling somewhere with decent internet, it’s a way to continue your game by bringing nothing but a controller. - For people who own a DualShock controller but no PlayStation, it’s a way of trying out a lot of exclusives. - It’s a way to play a game you already own without the hassle of reinstalling it, having deleted it to make space. You could also play a brand new game the minute it releases. The main benefit I see is treatment of games as a service - one that a company can offer far more easily than shipping a disc out, or even than from debugging a game to run locally on everyone’s computer. But I also don’t think it’s anywhere near replacing local copies, and it’s yet to be seen if it has a strong market appeal to non-gamers.",,Katana314,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I didn't expect an entire generational jump in graphics with the Pro from the PS4 standard. However with a brand new generation, I expect significant gains in performance. I'm just concerned that if developers are still tethered to the previous generation's hardware configuration, they will not be able to maximize the capabilities of the new hardware. I'm afraid everything will just seem iterative because devs have to make sure their games are manageable on old hardware. IF this happens I will be very curious to see just how many people take advantage. Consoles aren't like phones in that they are not seen as a necessity the way cell phones are. But that's the thing, we usually have a cross gen transition with multi platform titles and then devs switch to the new hardware in earnest. Also, it's funny you mention necessity of cell phones. Because it seems a LOT of people are spending more than the cost of a console even at launch to buy the best Apple, Samsung etc. every year when a new model releases. Honestly, i can't personally stand that trend. It makes no logical sense to me but i suppose that's what happens with good marketing. You create a social vacuum where people are ""uncool"" or don't have ""social status"" because ""Your S9+ is so last year, couldn't you afford an S10+?"" Honestly, i feel like people are used to paying monthly fees on things they can't afford to really buy, that it almost makes it a no brainer for consoles to go a similar subscription and contract model. ====================::==================== If Sony buys Take Two and IPs like GTA become exclusive to PlayStation that would be a huge boost for Sony going into PS5s gen onwards to really push system sales. There's probably no other title imo as hotly anticipated as a new GTA entry these days and sells as many units. Plus the amout of revenue DLC and micro transactions GTA V pulls in if replicated would sustain a healthy revenue flow to Sony. The cost though imo would probably be quite high but if memory serves, Microsoft was the one on a buying spree and picked up like 4+ well known studios to be exclusive. Sony making one massive purchase with Take Two would be huge for the brand. Personally, i think Sony could offer GTA games etc. on other platforms if PlayStation Now becomes their digital streaming service in the future to further diversify PlayStation beyond traditional hardware models whilst keeping physical releases on said models. Right now, i think it's safer to say this year we're gonna start seeing a lot more production spec talk for next gen. Especially if 2020 is the actual launch date.

Basically Google and MS know Sony cannot compete via streaming, so they're basically hijacking the market out from under them. The same way Apple hoodwinked music from Sony. The same way Netflix hoodwinked blu-ray. Expect Microsoft to have Call of Duty marketing by 2021. If that were the case PlayStation now would be going through the roof, because they were doing this way before Xbox. PSNow would be through the roof if it was the entire PS3 or PS4 library delivered to billions of devices day and date and it wasn't a rip off. It isn't so its not. The fact that Sony has owned a streaming games platform since 2012 and hasn't even hit smart devices yet is a testament to how grossly outgunned they are. If they're ""looking into it"" now, they're already 7 years behind. They don't even own a single data centre. Streaming a game is not going to be mainstream by 2020, or even 2025. Streaming games are much different than movies or music. Streaming games will be mainstream within 6 months of launch. Like touch screen or facebook. All the data centers in the world won’t fix data caps, latency and home internet connections. Sony is not 7 years behind lmao. They bought Gaikai in 2012. And we know from the article they’ve been tinkering with streaming games ever since. But Sony also knows it’s not realistic for the console gamer to magically jump over to streaming games next gen as the primary way to play. It’s not at all comparable to Facebook or a touchscreen for reasons listed. Is MS better prepared? Sure. But again thats not a magic potion to get customers ready. Nextgen will still be traditional hardware with physical media and digital. You can bookmark this post and laugh at me in 5 years if you want. But just like with Crackdown 3, project Xcloud is a project. It will take a long time to get right and they have to wait for the consumer to catch up. Assuming consumers even want that as the new standard in the first place Edit: just as an example. The Xcloud demo shown yesterday looks like it was faked. And if not the latency was extreme. Not a promising first showing, and that’s under their controlled environment https://youtu.be/thTW3GpyWVI",,Fishels,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I own both consoles and i think the Ps4 exclusives are way better, but Xbox still have some good games like Forza and Halo. Both services have a shit ton of games and a lot of garbage, but there are good games on both services. The difference is that the good games on Xbox is newer. Don’t act like there are 750 good games on PSNOW. Sll PS3 games can only be streamed and there are so many old and bad games, just as on Game Pass. You mentioned Uncharted. PSNOW doesn’t even have Uncharted 4. Bloodborne, TLoU and Uncharted NDC are all good games, but they are old and most people have played them. Two of them are fucking remasters. It’s the whole problem with PSNOW that the games are so old that people have already played them. Mate everyone and their pets have already played those games. But if you look at the third party games that the two services share, then theres no reason why PSNOW should be worse than Game Pass. Just look at this month where PSNOW gets F1 2017 and Game Pass gets F1 2018.

GeForceNow pricing vs Google's streaming vs xCloud, vs PSNow. I think xCloud would be my preferred method, especially if it's incorporated into GamePass. We know GamePass will have streaming capability soon, if MS wants to bring it to mobile and Switch. MS has also said xCloud will allow you to stream any game you own the license to. So that would extend beyond GamePass. What I'm hoping is that xCloud, instead of being a separate service, becomes an additional benefit of Xbox live gold and GamePass. Windows 10 will soon have the ability to play Xbox games Natively, according to next update adding powershell support for Xbox game packages and state of decay being tested by insiders. So GamePass games would run Natively on console, and win 10 PCs, and stream to other devices like mobile, tablets, switch, and TV apps. And xCloud will also allow all Xbox games outside of GamePass to be streamed, don't think that will be free, but don't want it to be a third service either, so having it as benefit of Xbox live gold makes most sense to me.

My experience was basically just like yours. What I remember is feeling really successful about circumnavigating a big crowd of enemies to get to a large door, only to find the door is locked and the only path is back the way I came, through the horde of enemies I had previously tried to avoid facing. I dunno, I’m pretty sure I had more places to explore that I could have aimed for on another try, but that was just such a disappointing and meaningless place to end my session that I just don’t think I see any appeal in continuing.

Discless Xbox One S ‘all-digital’ version ready for preorder in April, report says





The current Xbox One S video game console has a disc drive built in. A new version may not.


 Tania Gonzalez/CNET


Microsoft’s next iteration of the Xbox One may not have a disc at all, and it might be coming sooner than you think.

That’s at least according to rumors from Windows Central, which says a discless Xbox One S “All-Digital Edition” will be offered for preorders in April. The new device, said to be code-named Maverick, will offer a “disc-to-digital” program, letting fans turn in physical game discs and convert them to digital downloads, Windows Central added.

One benefit of this new Xbox, Windows Central said, would be that it could push the price of an Xbox down. The Xbox One S starts at $299 and is typically bundled with a game. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.

The move could mark a turning point for the video game industry, which has sold video games on discs and cartridges for decades. Some people still prefer to buy physical copies of their games, in part to share them with friends or trade them in at retailers like GameStop.

Industry mainstays like Microsoft and Sony’s PlayStation group have considered dumping disc drives for their consoles in the past. 

Sony, for example, debated removing discs from its PlayStation 4 console before the gadget’s launch in 2013. But the company ultimately kept them, in part because internet connections for people in some developing countries and at military bases aren’t reliable enough to support the many gigabytes of data required for a full game download. The company has also created streaming options, such as PlayStation Now, which let people play games over the internet in a way that’s similar to how they can watch movies from Netflix. 

In an interview earlier this year, however, PlayStation’s chairman of worldwide studios, Shawn Layden, said the company is mindful that not everyone has good enough internet connections to rely on digital-only services yet.

“If you’re PlayStation and you’re available in 168 countries around the world, streaming will be a thing which will have interest to certain people in certain places,” he said. “We can leave no gamer behind.”

Microsoft for its part has also considered a digital-only version of its Xbox before. Half a decade ago, the company was experimenting with a set-top box, as well as other Xbox designs, all to broaden the types of video game consoles it sells. 

These days, however, Microsoft has signaled it’s more willing to move gaming to the internet. Last June, the company said it’s building a streaming game service to compete with Sony, Electronic Arts and others. Microsoft also said it’s building a next-generation video game console, though it didn’t say when the device would launch.

I already wrote why Microsoft's GaaS is particularly anti-consumer but as per usual you simply ignore all of the reasons. It's like you just pretend you haven't already acknowledged there is an OPTION offered by Sony to pay real money to get them in-game immediately. You know what the word means, right? Optional? Nobody ever said you had to pay money. The GTS free downloadable car content is given away free of charge, no real life money required it's true. No, but it's an option Sony offers. An anti-consumer option that you're happy for them to do.",,FreedY,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

If every home on Earth had fibre optic it'd be a different story, but a cheaper streaming alternative to the pricier consoles is useless if you don't have a stable connection. And if you can access good internet, you can probably afford a PS4/Xbox. Streaming games is a technological inevitability, though. It's a scaling problem (need massive but inexpensive computing power) which essentially makes it a matter of testing the limits of Moore's Law. Google of all companies is obviously the best positioned for this (as you say) but I doubt that inevitability has come here and now. As someone who has used Playstation's Playstation Now service, I can tell you that unless you have a solid internet connection, the game play is just choppy. Even then, things like controller input usually take like half a second to register, which can make a huge difference with some games. Modern internet speeds just aren't up to par with what a service like this needs.",,️ronic,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

We're inspired by the game creators who spend years crafting these amazing worlds, adventures and experiences, and we're building technology that we hope will support and empower that creativity.​ What is Project Stream? Project Stream is Google's entry into the game streaming market. The program lets you stream AAA titles directly in Chrome without the need to buy expensive video cards or dedicated consoles. All you need is a broadband connection (25Mbps or higher) and access to Google Chrome. What games are available on Project Stream?

PsNow until very recently arguably has a worse service(streaming only until very recently) but still out sales game pass. It's no argument that Playstation exclusives are top tier and Xbox ones have been disappointing outside of forza. But to keep it strictly to games on the service. What games do you feel as strong enough to make game pass worth paying for as a mobile phone user and potentially switch users? Since pc gamers and Xbox one can already use it the market will be expanding to mobile phones. Sales for Xbox brand are mostly in NA which has data caps/throttling even for unlimited mobile data. So mobile gamers can't stream consistently on the go so they will be a lot of playing at home. Looking at the game pass list I don't see any games that are brand sellers. As for the strength of the brand Xbox ones recent disappointments with games hurt the brand. Sony and switch both have clear exclusive features that set it apart and that is why xbox is working on something else to sell people on. As an owner of a switch, Xbox one, and ps4 I use the Xbox as a plex machine. >Those numbers give us no idea about the size of the Xbox One business, and the squishiness of the data indicates that Microsoft doesn’t have the confidence to say many clear, unambiguous things about the size of the Xbox One business >The sales milestone is more evidence that Sony is “winning” the current console generation — although, importantly, Microsoft stopped sharing solid hardware sales information for the Xbox One in 2015. Microsoft has since replaced hard sales numbers with relative metrics that allow the company to show growth, without explaining how many people are picking up Xbox Ones or using its services. https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/8/18173711/ps4-hardware-sales-ces-2019",,LlewelynMoss1,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I think what I imagined as ""console"" versions of 3DS games was out of whack, especially after seeing what id Tech could do. I can't say I'm disappointed cause they do make Switch feel more like a handheld, which is what I want, these are exactly what I would have wanted for 3DS game sequels. If 3DS wasn't getting so old, I'd say I wished I could just get them on 3DS. In a way, I sort of preferred the lesser quality for the $40 price tag. In that regard, I don't feel the games are as good as I would want or just not use to seeing them in same price bracket as definitive console games like Metroid Prime 4 and Mario Odyssey, who in general just feel like way more game and way more budget. Just wondering if Fire Emblem and Pokemon as good as you imagined? ====================::==================== the_wire30 said: ↑ [Quote: =""phantomx, post Um, no? The Lost Legacy is a new game, and Shadow was remade from scratch using entirely new assets, not upresed ones. Click to expand... Lost Legacy was released as an expansion pack for Uncharted 4...and part of the season pass if you bought that. Why would it cost the same as a stand alone game? As far as Shadow, the ps3 “remaster” version was basically the HD version of the 2005 original with new assets for the ps3 in 2011. They charged $40 for that. That’s $10 less for a game that came out only 6 years before. Heck...they were still making and selling ps2’s in 2011! And the game looked/played basically the same with the better resolution/textures/frame rate. 6 years later they take the same game and redo its assists and textures and resolution for the ps4. And charge $40 again. But it’s still the same game/art direction/gameplay/style as the 2011/2005 version but yes...with development time by techies to make it look better on the ps4. New control scheme yes, but that is a minor change. What I’m saying is that LA Switch took develolment time to bring a 25 year old gameboy game and completely revamp it for a “modern” home console. It’s a completely different style and aesthetics and I’m assuming differences in gameplay to take advantage of Switch hardware that wasn’t available in 1993. They actually had to go through development time and effort to figure out what they wanted a 2018 Switch LA to look/feel like. There is simply just more time and effort involved for a complete remake like that compared to what Bluepoint Games did to bring their ps3 remaster to a ps4 remaster. Bluepoint and Sony new they couldn’t charge more than what they charged for the 2011 version (despite the new assists). They didn’t even dare charge what the original ps2 game costed! Mainly because ps4 gamers probably still had their ps2/ps3 version...or recently played that remaster through PSNow. Nintendo charging more for LA is simply the usual Nintendo premium (whether someone agrees with it or not: there are good arguments on both sides), it has nothing to do with the work involved. It certainly doesn't look like more work than other remakes like RE2, Ratchet, Shadow, Crash, Spyro, etc. Click to expand... I’m willing to be more people where involved in the LA remaster than the Shadow/Crash remasters, yea. You could argue whether it was needed or not, but I’m pretty sure Nintendo treated this development as they would any new console game. Also, what exactly makes you think Zelda will play so differently from the original? What gameplay changes do you expect? Click to expand... I’ve never know a Nintendo remaster on a home console to not change aspects of the game to fit the new hardware.

People feel what they feel. I'm playing through God of War right now, and I'm definitely playing it only for the story because the combat from the beginning frustrated the hell out of me. My default on 99% of games is Hard mode so that's saying something. Spider-Man played like the Arkham series and was a lot more satisfying. You can feel the way you want but calling those games cinematic experiences rather than actually having game play is wrong. Cinematic experience games are like Telltale games or Detroit Become Human, comparing any of those to games like God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Uncharted is a false equivalency. >I don't think you're at all clear on how Xcloud works. You're conflating it with Game Pass which is not a streaming service. No you are misunderstanding how XCloud is going to work, it's not going to include every Xbox game you own it's only going to include games that developers allow to use the service. Just because the game is on Xbox does not give them full control over the games. Again just like how they can't put every game on Game Pass hence why I keep comparing the two because they will more than likely share the same games if not be combined into one another assuming the can get the service actually usable. > As you pointed out yourself, Sony does not already stream all of their games. Their current exclusives are not offered on PSNow. The question is what happens if they go that route to compete with emerging competitors like Google. > > It doesn't sound like you're considering that at all. I'm not considering because Sony has given zero indication that they would even considering doing such a thing. They are not contemplating putting all their games on competing platforms nor have they even hinted at it, Xbox has hence why I am talking about it. Google jumping in the game means very little until they can get huge partners to be willing to put their games on the service and the service can actually prove itself. I've used Project Stream and while it works pretty good with some latency/frame drops here and there that was using a 100Mbps connection on ethernet not a mobile connection on the go. The way you talk about Google getting in gaming reminds of when people freaked about Facebook getting in gaming with Oculus and here we are years later and they no more a threat then the day they announced they were getting in gaming cause of how niche VR gaming which game streaming is just as small if not more so.",,outla5t,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Anyway, to me it appears as though both Sony and Google are using pretty much a traditional thin client server architecture for their streaming products, while MS is attempting something a little more complicated. I think we can all agree that currently there needs to be some things addressed, latency, scalability, and flexability. If everybody attempts to do the same thing to solve a problem we typically end up with same results for good or bad. Attempting new methods is generally where the most progress tends to happen. The only assumption i see here is yours MS is doing the same shit sony is doing,i told you people that streaming games wasn't just having servers and running the games,sony is ahead of MS on this because Gaikai and Onlive both own patent for low latency game streaming this isn't something that you can just do by simply running games off a cloud. But don't worry this demo was totally faked in a very Kinect kind of way. Nobody was claiming the demo was real. Ms is attempting something different. The basic way of streaming is how psnow is doing it. Even with the ""patented low latency"" tech psnow is still plagued with high latency and input lag. No matter who does it, that model is always going to be subpar. Whether they fail or succeed MS is trying something different. If sony tries something new and brings game streaming to near local levels great. I don't care who does it but psnow onlive are not the answer. Of the is a switch to game streaming I damn well want a viable option. We aren't gonna get there if everybody does the same shit over and over again. This is bigger than the console wars. Would you be happy if your only option for gaming performed like psnow?",,Steppy_76,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I didn't expect an entire generational jump in graphics with the Pro from the PS4 standard. However with a brand new generation, I expect significant gains in performance. I'm just concerned that if developers are still tethered to the previous generation's hardware configuration, they will not be able to maximize the capabilities of the new hardware. I'm afraid everything will just seem iterative because devs have to make sure their games are manageable on old hardware. IF this happens I will be very curious to see just how many people take advantage. Consoles aren't like phones in that they are not seen as a necessity the way cell phones are. But that's the thing, we usually have a cross gen transition with multi platform titles and then devs switch to the new hardware in earnest. Also, it's funny you mention necessity of cell phones. Because it seems a LOT of people are spending more than the cost of a console even at launch to buy the best Apple, Samsung etc. every year when a new model releases. Honestly, i can't personally stand that trend. It makes no logical sense to me but i suppose that's what happens with good marketing. You create a social vacuum where people are ""uncool"" or don't have ""social status"" because ""Your S9+ is so last year, couldn't you afford an S10+?"" Honestly, i feel like people are used to paying monthly fees on things they can't afford to really buy, that it almost makes it a no brainer for consoles to go a similar subscription and contract model. ====================::==================== Quote: : If Sony buys Take Two and IPs like GTA become exclusive to PlayStation that would be a huge boost for Sony going into PS5s gen onwards to really push system sales. There's probably no other title imo as hotly anticipated as a new GTA entry these days and sells as many units. Plus the amout of revenue DLC and micro transactions GTA V pulls in if replicated would sustain a healthy revenue flow to Sony. The cost though imo would probably be quite high but if memory serves, Microsoft was the one on a buying spree and picked up like 4+ well known studios to be exclusive. Sony making one massive purchase with Take Two would be huge for the brand. Personally, i think Sony could offer GTA games etc. on other platforms if PlayStation Now becomes their digital streaming service in the future to further diversify PlayStation beyond traditional hardware models whilst keeping physical releases on said models. Right now, i think it's safer to say this year we're gonna start seeing a lot more production spec talk for next gen. Especially if 2020 is the actual launch date. Not expecting it to be any later tbh. Lots of spec talk Im sure this year. MS might confirm their specs this year.",,Derb,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,PlayStation 5 Rumour & Speculation Thread - Page 62,,,

Fans would be able to buy games via a streaming platform, like its Xbox Game Pass digital subscription, to make gaming more like Netflix and Spotify where no one really owns anything. 

One benefit of a disc-less console is that it would make it much cheaper. As well, it’s simply how the times are moving: streaming dominates most of our lives now, and Xbox rival PlayStation offers a similar service in the form of PlayStation Now. 

It makes sense that Microsoft would go this way for the next Xbox. Last year, news leaked that the global tech company was working on a new project, codenamed Scarlett, which was Xbox’s version of a game streaming platform. 

Microsoft’s gaming head, Phil Spencer, hinted something along these lines at the company’s E3 conference in June, saying: “Our cloud engineers are building a game streaming network to unlock console gaming on any device.”

In a recent interview with GeekWire, Spencer added some more weight to Xbox’s cross-device plans, saying: “We want to bring Game Pass to any device that somebody wants to play on. Not just because it’s our business, but really because the business model allows for people to consume and find games that they wouldn’t have played in any other space.” 

However, the major issue is internet connections. Not everyone will have a good enough connection to facilitate cloud gaming, and latency is a problem, particularly in something like gaming. 

One solution could be 5G. At Mobile World Congress last week, Chinese phone company OnePlus had its prototype 5G phone on show, demonstrating how cloud gaming will be possible with 5G speeds. 

The next generation in mobile technology will allow people to stream large-sized games online, experience high definition, and almost no latency. There’s nothing to suggest that this is the tech Microsoft is going to be banking on for its version of cloud gaming, but it’s one option. 

When could we hope to see this new Xbox? Windows Central says that pre-orders could start mid-April 2019, with the new console on sale in early May 2019.

183447431450,3/14/2019,http://the-quint-news-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183447431450,"The movie Ready Player One revolves around an online gaming platform that connects millions of players around the world online in a single space where players interact and play games in virtual reality. Though, something like that may sound far fetched, Microsoft has laid the foundation stone to making something very similar for gamers.

The tech giant recently announced Project xCloud, which is an online gaming platform that will allow users to play console-quality games on PCs and even mobile devices (including smartphones).

The company showed off this technology at its Inside Xbox event where Microsoft officials streamed Forza Horizon 4 from the company’s Azure data centres to an Android device. The demo was to show how smooth the gaming experience would be and also how easy it would be to stream games from the cloud to mobile devices.

The company’s cloud gaming chief, Kareem Choudhry said that “scaling and building out Project xCloud is a multi-year journey. We’ll begin public trials in 2019 so we can learn and scale with different volumes and locations”.

According to The Verge report, Microsoft has already built dedicated hardware for its data centres so that the current Xbox games and the ones coming in the future will be compatible with the services.

The xCloud service will allow games to stream to devices. Microsoft has been testing the games with the wireless Xbox controllers which are connected to consoles, PCs and mobile devices. Currently, the issue for the company is to battle latency issues which it is trying to do via advanced network techniques combined with video encoding and decoding.

The company was very specific in saying that it is not be looking to replace gaming consoles, but it is looking to provide the same gaming experience on other devices.

Currently, the only companies close to competing with Microsoft in this space are Google with its own game-streaming service that it will announce at next week’s Game Developers Conference (GDC). Sony also offers a similar service called PlayStation Now that lets you play your PlayStation games on an iPad or iPhone.

Rather than ""running"" the app on the phone, the trend for that would be to 'remote desktop', which is what I do with VS and xojo on my iPad Pro. It is easier just to send the screen and then you solve all the other problems like the limitations of ARM horsepower, etc. Simply, instead of running a file on your phone, just run your entire desktop on your phone (or in the future, someone else's desktop-as-a-service). And that doesn't require high throughput. It will use a lot of data monthly, but peak speeds, not so much. Capacity and latency are ultimately the big benefits in 5G, not peak end-user throughput. If latency can be vastly improved, imagine not longer needing to shell out huge money for a gaming rig when you can just subscribe to one (along with all a Netflix of games) and run it off a relatively cheap terminal with a nice screen...a real, desktop substitute, PSNow for PCs.

Google has trademarked the name ‘Google Stream’ in Canada.

Google submitted to the trademark to the Canadian government with the application number ‘1948433.’ The trademark was officially formalized on March 4th, and Google filed it on February 26th of this year.

The trademark, unfortunately, doesn’t feature a logo of any kind.

Within the ‘services’ section of the filing, the trademark includes the following statement:

“Providing temporary use of online non-downloadable software for gaming; application service provider (ASP), namely, hosting computer software applications of others; platform-as-a-service (PAAS) services featuring computer software platforms for creating and collaborating with others to create games and gaming applications and for uploading, posting, showing, displaying, sharing or otherwise providing electronic media or information regarding the fields of electronic gaming, entertainment and general interest via the internet; computer services, namely, creating website-based indexes of information; providing non-downloadable computer software, namely, computer software for implementing a computer programming language, computer software development tools, and computer software libraries; electronic data storage, namely, storage and archival of data, electronic media, and digital content.”

It’s unclear if this description is an indication of what the trademark represents, though it’s likely that Google Stream is video game related in some way.

Rumours suggest Google will show off a subscription-based game streaming service at this year’s Game Developers Conference (GDC). Though little is known about the still unannounced platform, speculation hints that it’ll likely be similar to Sony’s PlayStation Now streaming service. It’s possible that the search company will call this still unannounced platform ‘Google Stream,’ with the streaming platform running on Google’s Chromecast, or possibly a new video game console of some sort.

GDC starts March 18th and continues until the 22nd. We’ll likely have to wait until then to find out more about ‘Google Stream’ and the company’s streaming platform.

Deep Down and Resident Evil 3 were mentioned, but RE3 only originally released only on a handful of consoles. One of which was the PS1 and was only made available to PS4 because of PSNow. Not sure if that counts. Plus it'll come to Xbox as a Remake eventually. Though I'd love a port over HD remaster of RE2 and RE3 and maybe even Code Veronica as a bundled package. I'd fork over $20+ for some classic RE experiences I'm HD. As for Depo Down, who knows if that game is actually ever going to come out. Another would be Street Fighter V... And I'm still salty over it. A huge franchise not releasing on Xbox or even the Switch is disappointing. I really want it despite the games shortcomings. As a huge fighting game enthusiast I feel like I'm missing out as so many other fighting games have come to XB1 yet THE fighting game hasn't. And we know it'll be another decade until another sequel drops. Overall though Capcom have been fantastic in supporting the Xbox and Western audiences. I'd say Square Enix is also getting better. I'm surprised with Kingdom Hearts III and most of the Final Fantasies finally being ported over to Xbox. Though the actual quality of their games and some of their decisions vary for better or for worse sadly. The last Just Cause, FF and KH were all sub par. Losing Sleeping Dogs and Hitman publishers. (IO Interactive are doing great though.) And I have no interest in Life is Strange yet that seems to be their biggest thing right now. And no news of a new Deus Ex or any of their existing franchises. And Final Fantasy seemingly stuck in development hell in the same vane as FFXV and KHIII is scary for them and I hope they come back lack Capcom has. Capcom on the other hand have been putting out quality and their very own RE Engine has solidified their reputation as they've put out TWO Game of the Year contenders in the span of two or three months. And I've been happily supporting them again for awhile. They have a lot of potential to bring back a lot of their older titles with fresh coats of paint and I'm excited.",,Congragumumlations,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I’d be keen to understand that edition of the game. That is Rockstar dedicated match for the present generation of consoles and as a consequence, it appears stunning. the same thing could wind up happening to Red Dead Redemption 2 if it comes to Rockstar.

Gun oil can be purchased at local gunsmiths from the game or found on the planet.

Once you take combat you see how flat the gameplay is. Fallout 3 was a game that is excellent.. It is possible to have a look.

The Demise of Red Dead Redemption 2 

Entertainment is something which you need to get, but it’s not a need to get. You are able to watch the trailer near the top of the write-up. Morgan from the trailer.

But some facets of the UI in Fallout are displayed like the option display beyond the Pip Boy. It’s also unclear right now if there is going to be a gap between the beta release and a complete initiation of this multiplayer mode.

Whilst many felt that the trailer overstated the game’s caliber itself, the potency of the trailer to bring in hype is undisputed. PS4 owners are able to play with that, too, as you desire a subscription to PlayStation Now but it isn’t quite as simple.

 This kind of streaming setup now works anywhere with a good enough Internet connection, not just in the house.
 5 with 5 posters participating 
In a major expansion to its years-old in-home game-streaming efforts, Valve announced today that Steam users can now stream games from their PC gaming libraries to devices outside the home as well.

The Steam Link Anywhere program, launched in beta today, lets users stream games from “any computer running Steam” to:

The only requirements for today’s “early beta” release, 
according to the announcement
, are that “your computer has good upload speed and your Steam Link device has a good network connection.” Those are imprecise terms, of course, but Steam’s in-home streaming has previously 
shown a pretty good ability to scale visual quality up and down
 based on network conditions. 

Valve’s announcement comes just days before Google is expected to 
announce its own streaming gaming service and hardware
 at next week’s Game Developers Conference. But that service will likely mirror other subscription services like 
GeForce Now
 or 
PlayStation Now
, which stream a selection of games running on powerful centralized servers. Steam Link Anywhere is more akin to 
Nvidia’s GameStream service
, which essentially lets your home gaming rig serve as the server to stream games you already own. 

Just last week, Sony released new PS4 firmware allowing users to stream PS4 games to their iOS devices, expanding a capability that was already available on Android and the PlayStation Vita.

Would I be spoiling a lot of the story if I jumped from Kiwami 2 to Yakuza 6? Already played y0 k1 and k2. I eventually plan on playing 3 , 4 , and 5 but trying to wait for them to be remastered on ps4. I want to play another yakuza game though and it will probably be a long wait for the other games. @Dempig Yes and no No because you can watch the story recaps of 3,4 and 5 in Yakuza 6 But Yes in that you will be missing out on that gamer to character bonding from playing throught those games; meaning, you wont be able to connect as much to the characters growth over the games like you would if you had played through them all. Yakuza is not like other games. Even Tekken, or SF, Metal Gear, Castlevania, or Splinter Cell or Tomb Raider, which have stories that change and progress over various games is not like it. Yakuza chronologically follows the casts lives as they start from young adults, sometimes children (Haruka) to people in their prime years to middle age. We see a journey of Haruka grow from small child to a mother and her relationship and bonding with her surrogate father Kiryu. Each game (aside from prequel Zero) took place in the same year the game was released, even down to the same month. Thats pretty unique and special. dont ruin it. Damn =/ I guess I better just wait it out...or maybe even pay for a couple months of psnow to play the older ones.

I played The Last of Us left behind on my vita like 4 years ago. It’s hardly their focus. It’s probably going to end up like motion controls/vr etc. The big companies will sell the hype saying it’s a revolution for gaming, but when enough people have tried it and realize they prefer traditional gaming the hype will die down. I think these companies are just trying to be first to capture the magic netflix had a monopoly in for so long. But I seriously doubt people are looking for another subscription service that offers a lesser experience from what they’re used to.",,Awlien,United States of America,,,Neutral,Sadness,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The Lost Legacy is a new game, and Shadow was remade from scratch using entirely new assets, not upresed ones. Click to expand... Lost Legacy was released as an expansion pack for Uncharted 4...and part of the season pass if you bought that. Why would it cost the same as a stand alone game? As far as Shadow, the ps3 “remaster” version was basically the HD version of the 2005 original with new assets for the ps3 in 2011. They charged $40 for that. That’s $10 less for a game that came out only 6 years before. Heck...they were still making and selling ps2’s in 2011! And the game looked/played basically the same with the better resolution/textures/frame rate. 6 years later they take the same game and redo its assists and textures and resolution for the ps4. And charge $40 again. But it’s still the same game/art direction/gameplay/style as the 2011/2005 version but yes...with development time by techies to make it look better on the ps4. New control scheme yes, but that is a minor change. What I’m saying is that LA Switch took develolment time to bring a 25 year old gameboy game and completely revamp it for a “modern” home console. It’s a completely different style and aesthetics and I’m assuming differences in gameplay to take advantage of Switch hardware that wasn’t available in 1993. They actually had to go through development time and effort to figure out what they wanted a 2018 Switch LA to look/feel like. There is simply just more time and effort involved for a complete remake like that compared to what Bluepoint Games did to bring their ps3 remaster to a ps4 remaster. Bluepoint and Sony new they couldn’t charge more than what they charged for the 2011 version (despite the new assists). They didn’t even dare charge what the original ps2 game costed! Mainly because ps4 gamers probably still had their ps2/ps3 version...or recently played that remaster through PSNow. Nintendo charging more for LA is simply the usual Nintendo premium (whether someone agrees with it or not: there are good arguments on both sides), it has nothing to do with the work involved. It certainly doesn't look like more work than other remakes like RE2, Ratchet, Shadow, Crash, Spyro, etc. Click to expand... I’m willing to be more people where involved in the LA remaster than the Shadow/Crash remasters, yea. You could argue whether it was needed or not, but I’m pretty sure Nintendo treated this development as they would any new console game. Also, what exactly makes you think Zelda will play so differently from the original? What gameplay changes do you expect? Click to expand... I’ve never know a Nintendo remaster on a home console to not change aspects of the game to fit the new hardware. I could be wrong, we’ll have to wait and see I guess!",,phantomx,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I haven't ignored your ramblings, they're just your biased opinions. You claim that GAAS will not benefit players, but don't say why. Also I'm going to guess you think Playstation Now is a great service? False. Once again GTS has free DLC, no money is required to get that free content. I already wrote why Microsoft's GaaS is particularly anti-consumer but as per usual you simply ignore all of the reasons. It's like you just pretend you haven't already acknowledged there is an OPTION offered by Sony to pay real money to get them in-game immediately. You know what the word means, right? Optional?

I just got to Chapter 6 in Red Dead Redemption 2 and... f***, man, one of the greatest games I've ever played. That scene riding back to camp with Unshaken playing. Probably one of my favorite moments in gaming. I understand why some people dislike it, but, for me, the game transcends just being a video game and moves into different territory. The writing, music, characters, story... All amazing. Anyways, I mentioned that I haven't played the original RDR because after almost beating (no spoilers from chapter 6, please) RDR2, I absolutely want to get into it.

183197350264,3/3/2019,http://lilyfriday5.tumblr.com/post/183197350264,"Decoding The Definition And working Of Best Streaming Media Player In Full Swing


The 2 most really useful players for streaming films proper now are Apple Television and Roku boxes. So, the obvious question one may ask is; which one ought to I buy? This query is a little bit difficult to answer because of recent additions to the Apple Tv, specifically the Hulu Plus application and Air Play Mirroring. Earlier than the brand new Apple Television add-ons the Roku LT was the straightforward decide because it supplied rather more content for half the value.


Which participant is better with regards to streaming motion pictures and on-line media content? Let’s study the pros and cons of every one. The content material sources of the Roku LT are really improbable. Additionally, lots of the options of this little field are only a bit higher than their opponents. The Roku LT interface is very simple and really consumer-pleasant with a channel layout that can be easily custom-made by the consumer and includes a easy uncluttered remote management.


The house Display is kind of simple to navigate and the Channel Retailer is loaded with choices. The truth that the Channel Store is separate from the home Screen makes it easier to view all the out there streaming motion pictures and content without overcrowding the home Display screen. Of all their models the Roku LT is no doubt one of the best deal. If for some reason it is not out there, have a look on the Roku HD. What makes Sky Customers Will probably be Able To watch The Royal Wedding ceremony In 4K -up of streaming players so impressive is what they do greatest, and that’s to seamlessly stream quality content material.


Roku owners don’t have any want to purchase Bluetooth remotes, pay additional for USB ports or MicroSD card slots or 1080p. Although the Roku LT is proscribed to 720p, the Roku 2 XS mannequin will stream 1080p video. The difference between 720p and 1080p is often indistinguishable to most individuals. Constant enhancements and updates have taken the as soon as simple Apple Television from being not a lot greater than a glorified player for Netflix to being the most effective in the sport for streaming films and Tv. Kodi Involves The Xbox One is an instance of the bigger cowl artwork from the Apple Television. Movie rankings and recommendations from Rotten Tomatoes and Genius are nice options that go alongside properly with the straightforward to use navigation.


Nonetheless it does price twice as a lot as the Roku LT. If you’re a Mac person and a music lover, AirPlay allows you to stream music together with movies and photographs from any of your iPad, iPhone or iPod gadgets. Unlike the Roku LT, Apple Tv would not assist Pandora, but you can easily entry and stream it from any of the iOS units. Another plus is the AirPlay Mirroring which is built proper into the Mountain Lion OS. This is a useful function, solely if you have a newer Mac that means that you can stream something that seems on your pc screen, together with flash and/or free Hulu video wirelessly directly to the Television.


Don’t forget iTunes. Together with streaming movies and Tv, Apple Tv also has the ability to stream videos and music from iTunes. 25.00 a 12 months, and stores all your music for you so there isn’t a worrying about storage house to your music at all. Roku users will also have the same choice with the upcoming launch of the Amazon Cloud Player software.


Clearly if you’re already a person of Apple merchandise their participant goes to a lot more attraction because you already converse the language and from that perspective it is a reasonably simple choice. Which Player is the better Choice for Streaming Movies and Tv? Merely put: in case you are already a fan of Apple the selection is simple, buy the Apple Tv.



 * Comedians in Vehicles Getting Coffee

 * The Sixty One


 * Secondary camera: 0.3MP

 * Sure playlists can sound repetitive

 * 1 month ago

 * Roku 4 (mannequin: 4400)

 * It forges a personal connection between you and your customers



If you aren’t already dedicated to Apple merchandise, get the Roku LT. The Roku LT is way inexpensive and also has extra obtainable choices as far as content is concerned. However the Apple Tv is a bit extra consumer-pleasant, and the newly added Hulu Plus helps the Apple Tv narrow the content material hole. When all is claimed and accomplished, the Roku LT has the benefit with these that aren’t Apple fans, due to its worth. Although the Roku LT will not be in any respect troublesome to use, these with much less technical expertise may need to opt for the better to use Apple Tv.

However, if they do it and don't include PS3 games … what's the point. Xbox 360 is close enough to this generation (as is PS3) to warrant interest in order titles. The addition of high profile Xbox 360 games has lead to a limited and noticeable boosts in sales for those games. So it's a win/win for everyone. The caveat for Sony is that PSNow is Sony's backwards compatibility, w/ PS3 titles leading the charge. If you allowed those games to be played on a new console at no additional cost (as long as you owned them before) you would be undercutting that service. As far as PS1 and PS2 titles are concerned and as Xbox is demonstrating, not all games from the past would be eligible for inclusion. Or even worthy of play. Sure Sony has a larger stable of exclusives games, the bulk of those games are 3rd party and for licensing reasons alone won't make the leap. Since I don't own any PS1 and PS2 games that I am aware of anymore, I would have to purchase them and in most cases, like a twisted metal I would prefer a remaster over an emulated version. Either way, I would still like for the option to be there over not at all.",,MPGamer18,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Yeah I can't see it being a new console when consoles in their traditional form general probably only have a few generations left, and Playstation and Xbox obviously dominate the industry (with Nintendo having carved out its own little niche in portable / party gaming). VR is a possibility but I do also think it might be game streaming in the vein of PSNow, but with the power of Google's massive server farms behind it, which would theoretically allow for processing speeds and graphics at the absolute peak of current PC technology - but able to be played on a small cheap device (or even a subscription service on existing devices?). Like I said though I don't think net infrastructure is QUITE there yet. PSNow works ""OK"" but the latency is very noticeable on action-intense games even when it's just a couple of milliseconds, and no amount of tech can compensate for that, it's purely down to the connection.

Anyways because of this, I can't stream games- EVER. Like once I was a able to stream a chess game. So I could complain about ps3 games not being downloadable, which is honestly kind of dumb, I've read things on hardware differences and emulation but if ps4 hardware is upgraded it really shouldn't be an issue, we should have the option to at least try. Anyways, so I can only download games from psnow, there is virtually no point in even trying to play any more games I can only stream. The issue I take with this, is that if this was the case, and game streaming has been kinda shitty for years anyways, like even if you have a good connection, a long lag spike or internet outage could force your game to close and cause you to lose unsaved progress, but if this was the case then WHY for fucks sake do they have the hd remakes of all the best PS2 games that are for ps3 and therefore only streamable, but not the original ps2 versions? Like the sly trilogy, or resident evil 4, metal gear solid 3, resident evil code veronica, I mean even if you have a decent connection, the average internet connection still suffers on graphics quality anyways, so its not like a good % of users even get to enjoy the updated graphics from ps2 to ps3, and if you subscribed to the service, chances are you aren't opposed to the outdated graphics textures of an old ps2 game, I mean most of those hd ""remasters"" are literally just someone turning up the screen resolution output to a max of 1080p anyways, maybe a texture upscale as well if they wanna get fancy with it. So why would they do that? Or why not at least just make both versions of the game available, ps3 and ps2 remake. Im sorry I know you guys don't have answers for this I just wanted to share my anger at this, lots of my favorite games, ones I subscribed to psnow for are literally unplayable for me, they disconnect before i leave the main menu 99% of the time, and suffer 2-5 second controller lag. Not that a lot of the downloadable games aren't great, but I am running out of those to play except for games like farming simulator and arcade games. Its just that literally ALL of the law greats that have hd remakes are on there in their ps3 versions, making them undownloadanle and therefore unplayable for subscribers like me. I wish there was a way I could bring this up as a suggestion to Sony but I doubt they'd care.

183411349909,3/12/2019,http://aresworld-universe.tumblr.com/post/183411349909,"Imagine a world where you don’t need expensive gaming hardware to play the next big release - a world where all you have to do is open the Chrome browser, pick out a game you want to play and instantly have it start without any need for a lengthy download or surprisingly large patch. 

That’s the idea of Google’s Project Stream cloud gaming service. 

Rather than needing high-end hardware, Project Stream allows you to use whatever computer you have around to play video games. Google handles all the heavy lifting on its own servers, which can process the latest version of the game at high resolutions and frame rates, encode it into a stream, and deliver the stream to you over the internet.

We got our first taste of the service during an extended beta that ran back in 2018, and now we’re set to see its evolution at GDC 2019 on March 19. Whether it remains in the browser or makes its way to a dedicated remains to be seen - but, based on what we played last year, Project Stream serves as an impressive showcase of what the future of cloud gaming could look like.

[Update: After a patent for a Google gaming controller went viral over the weekend, Google has opened up a teaser site for its GDC 2019 announcement. Head over there now to sign up for alerts and more information about the service.]

How Project Stream works

It’s not clear how the final product will work, whether Google will maintain the Project Stream name, or even whether Google will continue the project after this beta. But, for the moment, as long as you’re connected to the internet with a fast and stable connection and you’re using a recent desktop version of the Chrome browser, you’ve got the setup needed to use Project Stream. 

Playing a video game on Project Stream is as simple as opening a new tab in Chrome and going to the Projectstream.google.com page.  

Google will prompt you to run a connection test that checks your internet bandwidth, the latency between your computer and the servers, and any data loss. Google requires a streaming rate of 15Mbps, latency below 40ms, and data loss below 5%. With these requirements met, you’ll be ready to dive into a game.

The beta of Project Stream is offering Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, which is nothing short of a demanding title. When you launch the game in your Chrome tab, it will go fullscreen, and run exactly as if it has been launched on a proper gaming computer (except without a deep graphics settings menu). You can play with a keyboard and mouse or connect a game controller and play that way.



All of your inputs on the computer get sent over to Google’s servers, processed in the game, and everything happening gets streamed right back to you. This is why that latency is so important, because you can’t have a good game experience if everything you do in the game shows up a second later.

The limits of Project Stream haven’t been detailed, but Google has shown off the service running at 1080p and 60fps, pretty much the bar for quality PC gaming. 

All of your inputs on the computer get sent over to Google’s servers, processed in the game, and everything happening gets streamed right back to you.

So, in effect, you’re opening a new tab that pipes all your inputs to a high-end gaming PC that streams back the visuals and audio to your computer screen. This system is simpler than some others, which set you up with a virtual desktop that then remotely runs Steam, Origin, Battle.net, or what have you.

In the case of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey on Project Stream, you are still required to log into a Ubisoft account to play, but beta testers aren’t required to own the game.

It’s unclear at this point whether Google will require players to buy games and pay for the streaming service in separate transactions, or whether access to select games will be bundled into the service.

What games will be available on Project Stream?

Through the Project Stream beta, the only available game was Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. While this didn’t give us much idea of what games Google will offer in the future, it did give us a good idea of what games Google could be capable of offering. 

For a 1080p 30fps game experience at High settings in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, Ubisoft recommends a system with the following specs:

 * OS: Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64-bit versions only)
 * Processor: AMD FX-8350 @ 4.0 GHz, Ryzen 5 - 1400, Intel Core i7-3770 @ 3.5 GHz
 * Video: AMD Radeon R9 290 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 (4GB VRAM or more with Shader Model 5.0) or better
 * Memory: 8GB RAM
 * Video Preset: High
 * Storage: 46GB available hard drive space
 * DirectX: DirectX June 2010 Redistributable
 * Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card with latest drivers
For 4K at 30fps and high settings, the recommended specs bump up to include 16GB of RAM, a more powerful AMD Ryzen 1700X or Intel Core i7 7700 processor, and a beefier AMD Vega 64 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. With Project Stream shooting for 1080p at 60fps, the type of system it’s offering would fall somewhere between Ubisoft’s recommended specs.

The truth is a computer that can handle Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 1080p 60fps is going to be capable of playing a whole lot of games at these settings. Other major titles could easily see support on the service.

Games with a major online focus may have dicier prospects on Project Stream. Since competitive online games are often fast-paced and require split-second reaction times, the extra latency introduced by streaming will likely be an issue for serious competitors. That said, we don’t see these games being unplayable on the service.



What’s Project Stream like to use?

At its best, Project Stream is good. At its worst, well, Google won’t let you play below a certain threshold of quality, and you wouldn’t want to anyway.

We tested Project Stream on varying setups. We played on an unstable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection, a fast and nearby 5GHz Wi-Fi connection, and on an ethernet connection held steady and offered high bandwidth. 

The highly dated Chromebook hardware didn’t hold it back from playing.

We also played on a 5-year-old Chromebook, a 2-year-old Razer Blade, and a modern desktop gaming rig that would be happy to run Assassin’s Creed Odyssey at 1080p/60FPS on its own hardware. We even started one computer up while another was running the stream, and Google simply transferred control over to the second computer, with no stop in the stream.

Across the board, we’d describe the experience as at least playable. The highly dated Chromebook hardware didn’t hold it back from playing. The biggest issues come from a bad connection: if the connection speed drops, so does the game quality, with lower resolutions, latency, and far more noticeable compression. 

That said, in our experience, the visual degradation came before the latency, so we were able to continue battling enemies smoothly even if they started to look like ghostly swarms of pixels.

Overall, the graphics are fairly good throughout, especially when playing on a high-bandwidth connection using ethernet cables. Colors, shadows, and anti-aliasing look fine, and the frame-rate seems to vary between 30 and 60fps.



The low frame-rate was one of the two issues we noticed. The other was compression. Most of the time, it’s not super jarring, but when there’s a lot of detail in a scene and a lot of movement, the compression turns it all into a bit of slop. Character faces become a blur and hard edges (noticeably the character’s hair) go soft. 

It would seem to be a sign of the lower bitrate enabling this type of streaming, but the truth is that most of the time it’s unnoticeable, and would be even harder to spot if you weren’t looking for it (we were looking for it). Panning the camera and running through dense wooded areas in the game (and combining the two) were the only times we were turned off by the dips in visual quality.

The experience isn’t mind-blowing, at least until you remember that it’s using so little of your computers processing power that you’ve literally got a full-system virus scan going in the background and nothing changed. The visuals are comparable to what you’d get on a console, except with compression artifacts here and there. And, with a stable connection, it compares rather favorably to in-home streaming on a Steam Link.

While the price and service model Google adopts will go a long way in determining whether Project Stream is worthwhile, we can say right now that it works, and it looks good doing it. But, will Microsoft’s xCloud do it better?

I don't know if you have an Xbox One, but if you do have one, you could get it for that (the Xbox 360 version, I got the GOTY physical version), I ended up buying it again and playing it on there as I had it on PS3 originally. Undead Nightmare is worth playing too, though it's a bit buggy. I'd say that RDR2's story is better than RDR1, though I've played through RDR1 so many times now it might be a bit of fatigue speaking. RDR1 is definitely worth playing though, and I'm sure I'll play through it again many times more.",,Jason_Hudson,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,,,,

There's probably no other title imo as hotly anticipated as a new GTA entry these days and sells as many units. Plus the amout of revenue DLC and micro transactions GTA V pulls in if replicated would sustain a healthy revenue flow to Sony. The cost though imo would probably be quite high but if memory serves, Microsoft was the one on a buying spree and picked up like 4+ well known studios to be exclusive. Sony making one massive purchase with Take Two would be huge for the brand. Personally, i think Sony could offer GTA games etc. on other platforms if PlayStation Now becomes their digital streaming service in the future to further diversify PlayStation beyond traditional hardware models whilst keeping physical releases on said models. Right now, i think it's safer to say this year we're gonna start seeing a lot more production spec talk for next gen. Especially if 2020 is the actual launch date.

183335253653,3/9/2019,http://motleyfool-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183335253653,"Subscription streaming services are starting to look like the future of video games. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Sony (NYSE: SNE) have subscription video game streaming services that work on their consoles. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a streaming service that works on PCs and on its Nvidia Shield TV streaming service. Tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all reportedly considering or developing subscription video game streaming services.

Whichever companies end up on top of the subscription video game streaming pile seem sure to be rewarded. But what happens to other stakeholders? Hollywood and record companies have not exactly welcomed the streaming era with open arms. What will streaming do to game developers and publishers like EA (NASDAQ: EA) and Activision (NASDAQ: ATVI)? What will video game subscription rights deals look like? And how will video gaming change for users?

Image source: Getty Images.

Signing the deal

One of the most important things to consider about video game streaming services is how the licensing deals will work.

Not all streaming services rely on the same sorts of licensing deals. Netflix and its premium video subscription peers, for instance, have largely relied on exclusive deals and predictable payments. On the music side of things, deals have rarely been exclusive, and royalties are generally tied to usage. 

So far, the early arrival of the console giants (Sony and Microsoft) on the video game streaming scene has meant that streaming deals have included exclusives. Generally, the exclusives are the products of the companies’ own studios and/or publishers, making them a bit like Netflix-style original content. For instance, Sony’s PlayStation Now includes access to The Last of Us, which was developed by Sony’s Naughty Dog and published by Sony’s Sony Computer Entertainment.

Original content is a vital differentiator for streaming services that also makes them more cost-efficient. And if a company can lock down some of the best content for itself because it is the creator, that’s a win. Sony, for instance, published two of the 10 top-selling games of 2018 – Marvel’s Spider-Man and God of War – and made both PlayStation 4 exclusives.

PlayStation 4 is the clear winner of this current generations of consoles, with more than 91 million units sold, and it has achieved that status in part because of its acclaimed exclusives. Quality exclusives and originals bode well for Sony’s PlayStation Now subscription service, and suggest that the streaming future of video games will look at least a little bit like the streaming present of video games and TV, in which exclusive deals and originals loom large.

Video game developers and publishers

The streaming future of video games may be very appealing to Microsoft, Sony, and the other companies that are gearing up to act as middlemen between gamers and developers. But it can’t look as good to companies like EA and Activision.

On the bright side, steady long-term revenue from streaming rights deals might allow EA and Activision to rely less on loot boxes and microtransactions, controversial income sources that have allowed them to keep games profitable long after release. 

Game developers could also consider a move like the one Disney (NYSE: DIS) is making: Left with lots of movies and TV shows in a space increasingly dominated by streaming services full of original content made in-house, Disney decided to create its own streaming service. In fact, EA is already doing just that: It has a “cloud gaming” service already in the works.

Of course, the console giants may or may not be open to allowing every video game publisher to release streaming apps for their platforms. But ultimately they don’t have complete control over video game streaming. Since video game streaming can rely on cloud computing, a user’s home hardware does not necessarily have to be as impressive as you might think.

Consoles, streaming devices, and a complicated future

EA has demonstrated its streaming platform (still in development) on smart TVs with cheap wireless controllers. An Amazon streaming service will also use cloud computing to put modern games on less powerful devices, and Google’s service, called Project Stream, will reportedly get top-tier games to run in the Chrome web browser. With subscription gaming, the idea of needing big, beefy consoles in the home may become antiquated.

To be sure, there are still advantages to consoles. Netflix users can download movies to their devices for offline viewing, but to do the same with a video game would require console-like hardware. But if internet-connected users can stream desired games in 4K on a cheap Fire TV device, that will change the nature of the video game business.

It is easy to imagine a future in which Microsoft, Sony, and their new competitors sell hardware at cost and become increasingly reliant on cloud solutions.

The cloud’s the limit

Microsoft and Sony have captive audiences for their early streaming efforts, but the biggest changes that streaming video games will trigger have yet to come. When cloud computing solutions make leaner hardware gaming-ready, there will be a lot of competition in the video game streaming market and, most likely, consumers will be spending a lot more on monthly subscriptions and a lot less on video game and hardware purchases.

183409161334,3/12/2019,http://aresworld-universe.tumblr.com/post/183409161334,"It appears as though Google is finally going to unveil its game-streaming service. 

The company has been ramping up for its Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2019 keynote on March 19, and has now released a teaser website that lets you sign up for more information.

 * Google isn’t alone - Amazon is also developing a game-streaming service
 * We’ve already seen the patent for a new Google game controller
 * Nvidia says streaming can’t beat a gaming PC
What this tells us is that Google is putting a lot of effort behind its GDC presence. The company has 16 presentations at the conference on the first day alone and has confirmed that it will unveil more in a presentation on March 19. 

If you missed it while it was in beta last year, Project Stream allowed you to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey through a Chrome browser before the game came out.

Project Stream is expected to reemerge at this year’s GDC to compete with services like PlayStation Now from Sony as well as Project XCloud, which is expected to be the marquee feature of the next Xbox.

 * But is cloud game streaming too good to be true?

I suggest just getting your hands on the ps2 versions of silent hill 4, origins and shattered memories as they are cheaper than the pc discs, and origins was never put on anythign but psp and ps2, pick up silent hill one for ps1. emulate them on pc. buy this game on a third part site for like $5 CAD. downpour can be played on most modern gaming pcs through rpcs3 as well, but is a bit trickier to get the disc to work with the emulator. Pay for PSNOW if you want the HD collection, if you aren't aware what that is, it is basically running playstation games over the internet on your PC. you will need a DS4 Controller, whcih you can pick up at a pawn shop for like $20. or buy silent hill 2 dc and 3 and emulate them.

183456319994,3/14/2019,http://aresworld-universe.tumblr.com/post/183456319994,"Valve just announced that its Steam Link Anywhere software is now in open beta testing on Android, Raspberry Pi and Steam Link devices. 

As a software successor to the original Steam Link hardware that Valve killed off at the end of last year, Steam Link Anywhere allows you to stream any game from your Steam library to whichever of those aforementioned devices you choose. Keep in mind you’ll need strong enough internet signal for both the home PC and whichever device you’re streaming to for the whole setup to work.

Before Valve killed it off at the end of last year, the Steam Link was the best way to stream your game library from your PC to your living room. The drawback, however, was that the Link only worked on your home network.

 * Need a controller? The Sony DualShock 4 should do nicely
 * We’ve also got a roundup of the best open-world games
 * Could the Epic Games Store rival Steam?
Steam Link Anywhere promises a more versatile experience, one that you can take with you… well, anywhere, and doesn’t require additional hardware.

The future of game-streaming

What Valve is doing with Steam Link Anywhere mirrors a lot of what’s happening elsewhere in the industry. Sony’s PlayStation Now software streams a library of games from Sony’s server to the PS4 and PC, while Microsoft has been hyping its upcoming xCloud software that will stream games to iOS, Android and, according to some rumors, even Nintendo Switch.  

The difference between these services is that PlayStation Now and, presumably, xCloud, will be streaming games you don’t own via a subscription service model whereas Valve is simply making your own games available to you for free - a model that will appeal to more cost-sensitive gamers and those of us with already-massive Steam libraries.

In the same press release introducing Steam Link Anywhere, Valve said it will make more announcements at next week’s Game Developers Conference in San Francisco,  specifically around new Steam Networking Sockets APIs that should make developing lag-free online play even easier for Steam developers.

And there is no ""need"" for gigabit throughput if there is nothing that can actually use it. Never did I say you will NEVER have use for gigabit in residential, what I did is you do not ""need"" it and that is absolutely true. There are no residential applications that ""need"" gigabit, nor anything on the near horizon that ""need"" it. Even the stuff you cite doesn't come close to generating gigabit throughput, your game examples specifically. While you project demand for services into the future, you completely ignore the supply side of that equation which is ever improving compression and there is huge profit motive for content suppliers to improve compression. Simply and increase in demand for services doesn't necessarily correlate to an increase in bandwidth needed deliver those services and currently bandwidth (your pipe capacity) and throughput (what is actually being used) are ever diverging. People are getting ""upgrades"" after than their throughput is ""upgrading"". Even video can only generate so much throughput. Unless you are the Brady Bunch, how many simultaneous 4K streams are you actually going to use? How many games are you going to download at the same time while streaming 15 different 4K shows? You are only going to have X number of simultaneous game downloads going on (which have their throughput constrained by the server that is feeding you) and X number of streams. In reality, doing all this at the same time may consume 200Mbps, 300Mbps, maybe, but nothing close to 1000Mb. The ""need"" for Gb is a myth. The ""want"" of gigabit is quite real. You guys confuse ""wants"" with ""needs"" and insert a notion of ""in perpetuity"" when nothing of the kind was mentioned. Well, in 20 years we will ""need"" gigabit just like 1GB 20 years ago was more than fine, but isn't now. Fine, but that simply means you do not need it now or anywhere near now. You may need it...far in the future. I have gigabit and do all of the things you mention. I download XBOne updates and games, PS4 crap, PC crap, OS updates, stream video all the time (in both directions depending on where I am), torrents, usenet, dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, etc, etc, etc, and never do I come close to saturating a gigabit connection. None of these services are capable of feeding my fiber's appetite. It is always constricted on the server side. The reality is that if unlimited were not included, I wouldn't bother with Gigabit. I would get 300Mb instead (but with AT&T, lower tiers + unlimited end up costing about the same as Gigabit which includes unlimited). I ask you this. Do you ""need"" 256GB of RAM in your desktop right now? Do you think you will ""need"" 256GB of RAM say within the next 4 or 5 years? No. If you are doing rendering for work, perhaps, but typical residential PC and laptop users certainly won't. But that doesn't mean and no one would say that you will NEVER need it, although with hardware and software as a service, it is possible that the need for USERS to need ever increasing amounts of RAM will bend downward as more hardware and services users use moves to the cloud with the user having an connected appliance to perform their activities on, just like Google Assistant and translate don't run on your devices, the heavy lifting is done somewhere else. More and more things we do will be done that way. As things we want to do become more and more complex, it is simply easier and ultimately cheaper to have a centralized service that is maintained, upgraded and has immense horsepower while end user devices get simpler in terms of what they actually do by themselves. The devices we actually use will be increasingly more like Echo and Chromebook...PSNow and Netflix. That will drive total data consumption, but not so much throughput to insane levels. I think in 10 years Windows and the like will be more like remote desktop. You will pay a monthly fee to Microsoft and they host the computer hardware and software as services and you will have a sweet monitor, KB, mouse, running off some ARM terminal while the real horsepower is at the server end. Your content, desktop and everything else will be available across all of your devices so that no matter where you are or what device you are using, you have awesome, desktop level performance along with all of your stuff. No more buying multi-thousand dollar PCs every few years, worrying about constantly backing up your crap, trying to sync stuff across your office PC, home PC, tablet, etc. No more buying $500 game consoles every few years along with $70 titles. You will pay a monthly fee to Sony or Microsoft and have stand alone console performance and be able to play the same games on any device...phone, tablet, PC, smart TV, whatever wherever. And yep, people will pay the monthly fees because there will be value in it for them just like they are willing to pay for multiple video streaming services and music services. Old timers like me, will always have the one trusty desktop and a stand of external drives, but kids? Fuck it, they will proclaim, who wants to spend $4K on a fat rig when you can pay $20/mo and subscribe to one and have hundreds of games included with options to subscribe to more services.",,Economist,United States of America,,,Negative,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,

183295504186,3/7/2019,http://variety-movies-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183295504186,"An app and console update allows PlayStation 4 users to stream games onto their iOS devices, according to a Thursday tweet from the official PlayStation Twitter.

The PlayStation 4 update 6.50 must be installed in order for remote play to work. The free app, PS4 Remote Play, must also be downloaded from the App Store on the device you want to use for remote play.

Remote play allows the console to do the heavy lifting as the game is streamed to a device. PS4 Remote Play was already available for the Sony Xperia Z3, but now with it coming to iPhones and iPads, far more users will get to experience streaming PS4 games to their mobile devices.

PlayStation already offers game streaming to its PlayStation 4 consoles via PlayStation Now, a cloud gaming subscription service which is soon expanding to parts of Europe.

Game streaming could be the future of video games, as Microsoft is working on its own Netflix-like game streaming service. A step further than remote play, this service will deliver “console quality gaming on any device,” according to head of gaming Phil Spencer. Spencer further noted in an interview that reaching the wide audience of gamers means looking beyond selling them a console.

Tencent is also unveiling its own cloud gaming service, Tencent Instant Play, later this month.

As Microsoft and Nintendo look beyond the console wars— the two companies paired up for a spot flaunting “Minecraft” cross-play between Xbox One and Nintendo Switch last summer— there are hints that PlayStation is starting to do the same. Sony came under criticism around that time for not allowing “Fortnite” cross-play between PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, leaving players having to make new “Fortnite” accounts to play on the Switch.

PlayStation’s Shawn Layden praised Nintendo, Microsoft and other game makers during his opening keynote at last month’s DICE Summit, and called for unity among game makers.

“Sure, we all compete for attention to further this industry but we do so to keep the video gaming landscape vibrant and essential,” Layden said. “We have the power to bring people joy, inspiration, respite, we have the ability to transport them to new worlds and provide them with superpowers. As developers, we do not compete against one another. We all craft art, and art is founded on the creative, not the competitive.”

Basically Google and MS know Sony cannot compete via streaming, so they're basically hijacking the market out from under them. The same way Apple hoodwinked music from Sony. The same way Netflix hoodwinked blu-ray. Expect Microsoft to have Call of Duty marketing by 2021. If that were the case PlayStation now would be going through the roof, because they were doing this way before Xbox. PSNow would be through the roof if it was the entire PS3 or PS4 library delivered to billions of devices day and date and it wasn't a rip off. It isn't so its not. The fact that Sony has owned a streaming games platform since 2012 and hasn't even hit smart devices yet is a testament to how grossly outgunned they are. If they're ""looking into it"" now, they're already 7 years behind. They don't even own a single data centre. Streaming a game is not going to be mainstream by 2020, or even 2025.

183358584473,3/10/2019,http://motleyfool-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/183358584473,"The video game industry has relied on more or less the same business model ever since games moved from arcades to homes. Video game enthusiasts buy consoles like Sony’s (NYSE: SNE) PlayStation 4 or Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) Xbox One (or a gaming-ready computer) and then buy individual games. There have been minor changes over time – like the arrival of digital downloads and marketplaces like the PlayStation Store and Steam – but until recently, games were typically purchased individually. It won’t be like that for much longer. In fact, the first subscription streaming services for video games have already arrived.

Like movies, television, and music before them, video games are being disrupted by the advent of subscription streaming services. Some such services already exist; others are still in the planning stages. It’s early, but it’s clear that some massive companies are betting big on the subscription streaming future of gaming. Who will come out on top?

Early entries and platform-service synergies

Some tech giants are plotting subscription streaming services right now, but they’re already a step behind the earliest arrivals to the video game streaming market.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a video game streaming service called GeForce Now. That service is designed to work on PCs, Macs, and the company’s own game and video streaming device, the NVIDIA Shield TV.

There’s also Microsoft and Sony, two of the three biggest companies in console gaming. Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass and Sony’s PlayStation Now are designed to work on their respective companies’ consoles; PlayStation Now also works on PCs.

How much does a head start like this matter? It could be significant, especially given the connections Sony and Microsoft have established between their streaming services and their consoles. Sony has sold 91.6 million PlayStation 4 consoles: the best showing of any current-generation system. Only PlayStation Now will work on those consoles.

Sony’s advantage in hardware has translated to an advantage in streaming subscriptions so far. According to research firm SuperData, PlayStation Now generated $143 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2018, by far the most of any video game streaming service. Though there are other relevant factors (like the larger size of PlayStation Now’s library relative to that of Xbox Game Pass), this helps illustrate the advantage Sony enjoys due to the popularity of its hardware.

With that in mind, it’s worth keeping an eye on Nintendo, too. The Switch has sold more than 32 million units since its debut less than two years ago. Along the way, it hit 20 million units sold faster than any other gaming console in history. Nintendo’s online gaming subscription service includes a small number of streaming games from past Nintendo consoles (NES games are available now, and Super Nintendo games are expected soon). It’s also not hard to imagine Nintendo building out a service that supports newer games.
Console Units Sold (as of Dec. 31, 2018) PlayStation 4 91.6 million Xbox One 40 million (estimated) Nintendo Switch 32.3 million 
Data sources: Sony, VGChartz, Nintendo.

Other tech giants are lurking

Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have an obvious advantage here. And it’s not hard to see why NVIDIA – which makes hardware for gaming PCs, among other things – is getting involved. But they aren’t alone.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is rumored to be working on a video game publishing and/or streaming service of some kind. Alphabet’s Google has a video game streaming service called Project Stream in the works. And Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is also said to be developing a video game streaming service.

Amazon, Apple, and Google may not have video game consoles of their own, but they have other options for attacking the video game streaming market. They could follow NVIDIA’s path and offer streaming devices with beefy hardware specs up to the task of video game streaming, for instance. Or they could use their wireless transfer protocols to stream video games from a computer to a streaming device – for instance, Apple could have you run the video game streaming service on a MacBook, and then send it to your Apple TV using AirPlay.

Furthermore, Google is reportedly mulling a hardware offering down the line. For now, though, Google’s video game streaming service is expected to work inside the Chrome browser – which is possible because Google, like the rest of the console-less set, can use cloud computing to make up for its lack of gaming hardware.

Using cloud computing to do the heavy lifting makes it possible to play modern games on stripped-down hardware. Video game company Electronic Arts has shown off early versions of a streaming service that would allow users to play games on underpowered devices like smart TVs, while Google is working with Ubisoft to get Assassin’s Creed Odyssey to run on Project Stream. Cloud computing is also reportedly the key to Amazon’s video game subscription service plans.

Of course, consoles can benefit from this, too. Nintendo has used cloud computing to let Nintendo Switch owners in Japan play games that the Switch could not run on its own hardware. Meanwhile, Microsoft is developing a service called Project xCloud that will bring Xbox games to mobile devices and other less powerful platforms – and perhaps open the door for cheaper Xbox hardware.

Who has the advantage?

Cloud computing goes a long way toward erasing the advantage that companies like Microsoft and Sony have in the form of their consoles. But this isn’t just about computing power: Microsoft and Sony have built-in audiences for their existing and potential streaming services, because they already have loyal fan bases of console users. Furthermore, both companies have in-house game development teams that could bring down the cost of content. (All of this is true of Nintendo as well, though that company has so far flirted with serious streaming efforts only in Japan.) Combined with a head start, these advantages give Microsoft and Sony the upper hand – at least for now.

Even if it did, should this venture for MS be successful they can then invest in studios to create tailor made games for different markets. Like I've said like three times at this point, success in one generation doesn't mean anything. Likely going to keep that market share? Dude, no. It took the PS3 years to recover despite owning the market with the PS2. What if the next Xbox is cheaper? what if the specs are better? what if it happens to have better launch titles? better marketing in general? And sure there are hints the next PlayStation will be BC but we don't know, what if it wasn't. Who knows maybe Sony's post PS2 hubris will have taken effect again. I found their last E3 to be pretty arrogant despite the selection of games shown to be phenomenal. And here's the thing, even should xCloud and GamePass succeed there's space for Sony as well if they're capable. They already have PSNow so they have some infrastructure as it is. It doesn't seem like a priority for Sony at this time however. And if MS did care don't you think they'd stop launching all their games on PC, stop with all this talk of cross platform play, tearing down barriers, game streaming on any devices. And if the rumours of GamePass coming to Switch turn out to be true isn't that a really fucking weird thing to do if you cared about the success of a competing platform. The box you play your games is irrelevant at the end of the day.

(I don't know if it runs on the Peace Walker engine or what.) You can move while crouched similar to PW and MGS4. In OG MGS3 you could either move while standing or crawling. Trying to move while crouching is how you transition to crawling. OG MGS3 also used pressure sensitivity which the dualshock 4 and Xbone controller (and almost all keyboards, I'm sure a pressure sensitive keyboard exists somewhere) lack. This is ESPECIALLY bad in the PSnow version of the HD collection, where you can't really aim without firing. 360 version (and thus the Xbone BC port) have a seperate key for aiming and firing and while it works, you auto-lower the gun after you stop firing which made burst firing while remaining aiming down sights impossible. I'd argue the Camo and Cure system (At least on OG MGS3. How does cure work in the 3DS version?) became tedious as hell pretty quick. Crawling across different surfaces? As soon as you reach the second surface, pause, go to the camo menu and change uniform and facepaint. It doesn't seem like a big deal but some areas have a lot of different surfaces so you'll be changing a lot. As cheesy and ""handholdy"" MGS4's Octocamo (think of it as a chameleon suit) was, I found it much less annoying as you just hold still and your camo changes to match. Cure system I sort of liked but it felt like it should have been expanded on. Besides certain diseases, Bullet Bees, Tranq Darts, leeches. or poisoning 99% of injuries you accumulate (cuts from soldiers with knives and maybe crocodiles, gunshot wounds from bullets, burns from grenades, rockets, flamethrowers, and fractures from falls or certain attacks from bosses) simply reduce your max health a little. Get a ""serious"" wound? Gotta open that pause menu go to cure, and apply the treatments. I just found it got in the way as I'd often be using it during boss fights. The Fear was especially annoying as EVERY arrow = a wound and if you don't extract it, it'll heal and you'll play the rest of the game with crossbow bolts sticking out of your arms, face, and ass. I'd like to see the cure system just streamlined and expanded upon. Keep all the treatments but you find some quiet place, and hold a button down and Snake/Big Boss automatically applies the needed treatments in order. I.E. I get a gunshot wound, I hold a button (perhaps a menu opens to select what I want to treat) and Snake sits, and in order, extracts the bullet, (If available) applies disinfectant, (if available) applies styptic, and (if available) applies a bandage to finish. Items not available are skipped. I.E. no disinfectant = Snake applying styptic and a bandage after extracting the round, leaving the untreated section to heal on it's own or until I find disinfectant. Likewise broken arms and legs should have more of an ingame impact. Broken legs result in slower running (No I'm not sadistic to the point broken legs mean you can only crawl, that would suck) until treated or healed, perhaps broken/wounded arms result in less effective CQC or increased trembling when aiming, slower swimming, etc. Broken ribs (I think Volgin and the boss inflict them, maybe if a goat kicks you or other ways to get hurt?) could cause stamina drain and make you rapidly run out of breath when running. These are just ideas of how the system could be overhauled. I never found stamina/eating a concern. Maybe you should have to eat more in a hypothetical remake, + get rid of Snake's magic backpack that can store every item you carry and makes them weigh nothing until you take them out. (I always found that dumb. I understand the idea is items in your backpack are not in your inventory so you can't carry around everything, and what you carry in your inventory has weight, but a min-maxer will just carry nothing, and when he needs it, go to the pause menu to take it out of his backpack, put it in his inventory, use it, and put it back when done to minimize stamina drain.) Ideally it could be something like Jagged Alliance 2 1.13 where every gear (webbing, pockets, pouches on vests, including MOLLE so you can even customize your vests and such) are modeled so you can carry quite a bit, but you have both a weight (raw weight) and encumbrance limit (I.E. you can only carry as many magazines as you have mag-pouches, anything not ""on your person"" in your limited space backpack requires you a delay to open it and take it out) with ways to get better backpacks like stealing them from the enemy or macgyvering something up. MOLLE wasn't around in the 60's but basic, likely not modular LBE was. Or you could just say fuck it Volgin used the philosophers legacy to kickstart it for the KGB and GRU, and you can take vests and pockets from enemies or their stockpiles.",,Toybasher,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Basically Google and MS know Sony cannot compete via streaming, so they're basically hijacking the market out from under them. The same way Apple hoodwinked music from Sony. The same way Netflix hoodwinked blu-ray. Expect Microsoft to have Call of Duty marketing by 2021. If that were the case PlayStation now would be going through the roof, because they were doing this way before Xbox. PSNow would be through the roof if it was the entire PS3 or PS4 library delivered to billions of devices day and date and it wasn't a rip off. It isn't so its not. The fact that Sony has owned a streaming games platform since 2012 and hasn't even hit smart devices yet is a testament to how grossly outgunned they are. If they're ""looking into it"" now, they're already 7 years behind. They don't even own a single data centre. Streaming a game is not going to be mainstream by 2020, or even 2025. Streaming games are much different than movies or music. Streaming games will be mainstream within 6 months of launch. Like touch screen or facebook. All the data centers in the world won’t fix data caps, latency and home internet connections. Sony is not 7 years behind lmao. They bought Gaikai in 2012. And we know from the article they’ve been tinkering with streaming games ever since. But Sony also knows it’s not realistic for the console gamer to magically jump over to streaming games next gen as the primary way to play. It’s not at all comparable to Facebook or a touchscreen for reasons listed. Is MS better prepared? Sure. But again thats not a magic potion to get customers ready. Nextgen will still be traditional hardware with physical media and digital. You can bookmark this post and laugh at me in 5 years if you want. But just like with Crackdown 3, project Xcloud is a project. It will take a long time to get right and they have to wait for the consumer to catch up. Assuming consumers even want that as the new standard in the first place Edit: just as an example. The Xcloud demo shown yesterday looks like it was faked. And if not the latency was extreme. Not a promising first showing, and that’s under their controlled environment https://youtu.be/thTW3GpyWVI Lol",,HentaiMan,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

There's probably no other title imo as hotly anticipated as a new GTA entry these days and sells as many units. Plus the amout of revenue DLC and micro transactions GTA V pulls in if replicated would sustain a healthy revenue flow to Sony. The cost though imo would probably be quite high but if memory serves, Microsoft was the one on a buying spree and picked up like 4+ well known studios to be exclusive. Sony making one massive purchase with Take Two would be huge for the brand. Personally, i think Sony could offer GTA games etc. on other platforms if PlayStation Now becomes their digital streaming service in the future to further diversify PlayStation beyond traditional hardware models whilst keeping physical releases on said models. Right now, i think it's safer to say this year we're gonna start seeing a lot more production spec talk for next gen. Especially if 2020 is the actual launch date.

1. Don’t mock Google’s gaming hardware, it’s only a mockup

We know Google is hard at work on Project Stream. But the latest news might be more fake news than anything else.

First, let’s take a look:



The news:

 * The above renders of Google’s Project Stream game controller were published over the weekend, the perfect time to lead a frenzy of pretty underwhelmed reactions that spread like wildfire. 
 * Ugly/bad/painful/uninspiring were the general themes. And fair enough, it ain’t pretty. That controller does not spark joy. 
 * But but but… this isn’t the coming Google controller at all, just mocked-up renders based on Google patent filings. 
 * That patent was a recently published game controller patent from Google, which actually boils down to a patent on a gaming notification system, working between a gaming controller and a gaming system. 
 * The 2019 patent filing extends from a 2014 patent, and did come with some interesting images attached, such as the below design: 


 * So that diagram led to the “reveal” of the renders which then led to the vortex of news and views ahead of time. 
 * We know by now that just about all patents featured technical images rather than anything based on true industrial design or materials. 
 * And I mean, Google might still release an awful game controller. That is its prerogative. The internet and everyone can react when that happens. 
 * But we haven’t really seen what might be coming from Project Stream. Just diagrams. (And the diagram is somehow much nicer than the render anyway?) 
 * Moving on! 
Project Stream and the coming revolution in gaming:



 * While we’re here, a refresher and quick dive into the future: we’re on the cusp of the next major disruption in entertainment. 
 * And, therefore, a disruption in attention, money, hardware, software, platforms, game controllers… 
 * Project Stream is Google’s not-so-secret service that it hopes will lead it to successfully disrupt gaming by creating a device that can play games via streams, rather than via local hardware. 
 * It works by allowing you to play any game on any platform via cloud servers, near your location, via a single hardware device. 
 * Rather than playing on your own device, such as your classic LED-lit gaming PC, your gaming device is a connection to the cloud, which is running dedicated hardware. 
 * You pay a subscription each month for this access, rather than own depreciating hardware, and stream at high-quality 1080p/60fps. 
 * It relies on fast transfers of data with almost zero latency, which seems extremely unlikely if you recall dial-up modem days weren’t that long ago. 
 * But it’s already working, although it won’t work for the entire population just yet, given it relies on network infrastructure. 
 * We saw a Project Stream technical test that ran for several months, allowing tested to play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey in a Chrome browser tab. 
The competition is fierce already:

 * Now, this is already a thing and companies are arming up in the space, fighting to become the “Netflix for gaming” winner. 
 * The cost for entry is strong software and a link to speedy hardware. (And starting a data center is not cheap – as Hemant Mohapatra recently explained). 
 * So who’s on the playing field? 
 * Sony’s PlayStation Now is live for 650+ older games but is a more average experience, despite Sony’s early moves here with acquisitions of Gaikai (2012) and OnLive (2015). 
 * (It’s about where I thought gaming-on-demand would get to before we had a major 5G rollout for both wireless and fixed data.) 
 * Other offerings have been much smoother. 
 * GeForce Now from NVIDIA supports more than 400 games and is surprisingly good. 
 * Microsoft, the home of Xbox, has Project xCloud announced, aiming for a 2020 release. 
 * Nintendo has an offering on the Switch already, but only in Japan for now. 
 * Amazon, which owns gaming powerhouse Twitch, is working on a service due in 2020, and has the benefit of its AWS infrastructure. 
 * Verizon has Verizon Gaming in the works. 
 * EA is working on helping developers create games for a streaming-first world. 
 * There’s also the Shadow device from Blade which offers a full PC device, streamed from the cloud, with gaming. 
What’s next?

 * Google’s Game Developer Conference is happening from March 18th, with a “Google reveal” scheduled for March 19th. 
 * We’ll know more – including, potentially, what the actual controller might look like – then! 
2. Android Q’s first developer preview could arrive later today (Android Authority).

3. Hold onto your hats: Tesla announces it won’t close retail stores and will go back and raise prices on its cars that it slashed (Tesla). (No change to $35,000 Model 3, no price hike until March 18th. Chaos! All ahead of the big March 14th Model Y reveal.)

4. Foursquare wants to know how creepy you think its new ‘Hypertrending’ feature is (9to5Mac)

5. The other smartphone business: Out of the shadow of Android (TechCrunch).

6. How the internet travels across oceans: ‘People think that data is in the cloud, but it’s not. It’s in the ocean.’ (NYTimes) – A very nice interactive feature.

7. Over a quarter of US adults now own a smart speaker, with 60% owning an Amazon Echo (Voicebot.ai).

8. ICYMI: Elizabeth Warren proposes breaking up tech giants (NYTimes)

9. Quantum radio! A new quantum circuit picks up infinitesimal radio signals, may open up new opportunities in radio astronomy and medical imaging (TUDelft).

10. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed again in a tragedy that poses serious questions for Boeing (Reuters). China’s aviation regulator has grounded nearly 100 Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by its airlines.

11. Twitter account asks the all-important video game question: Can you pet the dog? (Kotaku).

Those people are invested in their current consoles and probably cant afford to spend what will probably be £400 on a new console then hundreds to create a new gaming library and whole online profile to play with other gamers when the community isnt even established with Google in that market yet. They won't just be dropping a surprise console it would be heavily advertised and promoted to make sure they get interest before launching To me it just looks like they are launching some new kind of VR experience system? Yeah I can't see it being a new console when consoles in their traditional form general probably only have a few generations left, and Playstation and Xbox obviously dominate the industry (with Nintendo having carved out its own little niche in portable / party gaming). VR is a possibility but I do also think it might be game streaming in the vein of PSNow, but with the power of Google's massive server farms behind it, which would theoretically allow for processing speeds and graphics at the absolute peak of current PC technology - but able to be played on a small cheap device (or even a subscription service on existing devices?). Like I said though I don't think net infrastructure is QUITE there yet. PSNow works ""OK"" but the latency is very noticeable on action-intense games even when it's just a couple of milliseconds, and no amount of tech can compensate for that, it's purely down to the connection. Even PS4 Remote Play across a LAN has (for me) noticeable lag... e.g. it was 100% fine for playing Persona 5, but it made Spider-man unplayable as it was impossible to time the dodges and counters.",,Toy Soldier,United Kingdom,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,Google announces the Google Stadia,,,

I remember back in 2009 and 2010 When most platinum trophies took some serious time to earn. Now we have lots of games where you can get a platinum in less than an hour. Some of them are pure trash. You can tell they were made just for a quick buck from the developer. But on the other hand some are actually decent games. I really enjoyed a recent game called JackQuest. It's a easy platinum to obtain but I thought it was a decent game. My question is this. What quick platinum trophies do you think are actually good and worth it and which ones are garbage. I myself have some really respectable hard to earn platinum trophies (In my opinion anyway) and I definitely have some garbage ones too. (Mayo, Orc Slayer, etc) Just saying lol.

Great I get Sea of Thieves? Crackdown 4? Just Cause 4? So a bunch of flops. Also you keep harping back to the point that there's newer titles, like somehow new means better and that you seem to think there's a large chance someone has played the majority of titles on PSNow without considering their library of over 750 games. There's plenty I haven't played on PSNow that I'm looking forward to playing, and plenty new games added every month which just makes the service even better. At least PSNow has masterpieces such as Bloodborne, The Last of Us, Uncharted, etc (I can go on?). Xbox has... Gears of War...

From today, the console will now properly sync with iOS devices, giving iPhone and iPad users the ability to game with the PS4 Remote Play app. Given that Sony first launched remote play (for its Xperia Z3) in October 2014, it's certainly been a long time coming. Much like its forbears, setup is as simple as updating your PS4, downloading the app and pairing the two. The on-screen controls are overlaid onto the image, and like many mobile games, will probably play better with a third-party controller. Sadly, you can't connect a DualShock 4 to an iPhone unless you've jailbroken it, so third-party options are probably the way to go. Of course, if you've really wanted to play PS4 on your iPhone, you've been able to, just not without Sony's express blessing. Third party apps, like R-Play, have enabled this since 2017, although unlike Sony's offering, you had to pay $12 for the privilege. If that seems too steep, you can now grab the PS4 Remote Play app for iOS in the App Store. https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/07/sony-ps4-remote-play-ios/ Link to App: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ps4-remote-play/id1436192460 Now I've already personally speculated that Sony's answer to xCloud isn't to push remote play on PSNow servers. Rather its to utilize PS5 back-compatibility PS1-PS4 to allow PSNow to download all games which are all remote play enabled. Essentially your own console becomes the remote server and allows you to play all your existing games on various devices for no cost.",,michaelmikado,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

183251378638,3/5/2019,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/183251378638,"With about three months to go before E3 2019, Xbox rumours are already heating up. Microsoft has previously confirmed it is working on multiple new Xbox consoles, and now its plans appear to be coming into focus.

There is a lot of information out there about the new Xbox consoles, so we’re rounding up all the rumours and speculation into this post to help make sense of the matter. Bear in mind that while the sources for each rumour have proven reliable in the past, everything mentioned here is unconfirmed, and as with all rumours, plans are subject to change. Microsoft’s official stance is that it does not comment on rumour and speculation. With that caveat out of the way…

A Disc-Free Xbox One

Rumoured for many months already, and discussed at a conceptual level for years, the disc-free Xbox One is said to be codenamed Xbox Maverick. Windows Central reported that this system will actually be called “Xbox One S All-Digital Edition.” Pre-orders for the console are said to open in April, with the console then scheduled to go on sale in May around the world.

This would be a first for Microsoft, as all previous Xbox hardware featured a disc drive. Pricing hasn’t been mentioned in any reports yet, but dropping the disc drive would presumably lower the cost. In fact, it’s believed that the disc-free Xbox One would be the cheapest Xbox One offering to date.

Also unclear at this stage is if the disc-free Xbox One would contain any further changes to the Xbox One hardware or design. WindowsCentral posted a Photoshopped mock-up of what an Xbox One without a disc drive might look like–check it out here.

The video game industry, like film, TV, and music before it, is increasingly trending toward the digital space and away from physical media. Microsoft itself is pushing further into the digital space with its new streaming service Project xCloud, which according to Brad Sams, will enter a trial phase later this year. Another Microsoft digital subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, is proving popular already with millions of people signing up. It’s clear digital is important to Microsoft going forward.

All-digital hardware has been attempted before, as Sony launched the PSP Go back in 2009–but it failed. It’s been a decade since that trial, and general internet availability and speed has improved since then. Still, there are parts of the world where access to internet is limited, and other places where speeds are less-than-great (hello, Australia!). For those who prefer physical media, Microsoft will continue to make Xbox One consoles with disc-drives, so there is no need to worry about an all-digital future taking over, at least not yet.

The Disc-To-Digital Program

A key component of Microsoft’s disc-free Xbox One plans is what’s being referred to as the “disc-to-digital” program. As part of this, users can trade in their console discs for a digital license for games they already own. The disc-to-digital program is expected to launch around the same time as the disc-free Xbox One console’s release in May, or a little earlier, Brad Sams reported. People will be able to visit the Microsoft Store and Best Buy (and potentially others) to swap their discs for digital licenses. The specifics about how this will work remain unclear.

Retailers might not be very happy about this news, especially GameStop, whose “buy-sell-trade” business model hinges on physical media remaining popular. But no one is asking players to care about the health of retailers; if this is the way the business is going, retailers will need to adapt. For its part, GameStop has diversified its offerings substantially of late to focus more on digital options and physical content like Funko Pop! toys and other physical merchandise.

A New Fortnite Xbox One

Microsoft already offers an Xbox One hardware bundle that comes with Fortnite and various extras, but the company is reportedly planning to push even further on the battle royale game. A new Xbox One featuring a design inspired by Fortnite is coming, according to Windows Central, though the site didn’t have any further information about the system and if it will be an Xbox One S, X, or the new disc-free edition.

Next-Gen Consoles

Microsoft is reportedly working on multiple new Xbox One consoles in development under the “Scarlett” umbrella. The first is codenamed Anaconda, according to Brad Sams, and is the new high-power Xbox One to follow the Xbox One X that was released in November 2017. The other, codenamed Lockhart, is said to be the budget-oriented offering.

At E3 2019 in June, Microsoft is expected to discuss both of these consoles, though it’s unclear at this stage how deep into specifics the company plans to get. Sams reported that Microsoft’s idea with the new consoles is to “make next-gen gaming available to wider audiences with a lower price of entry.” The consoles aren’t expected to be released until Fall 2020.

According to Sams, the Anaconda console will be priced in line with Sony’s PlayStation 5 (which is rumoured but hasn’t been announced yet), while Lockhart will cost less.

Specs are unknown for Anaconda and Lockhart, but Sams reported that both consoles will have solid-state storage, which would be a big improvement over the Xbox One X’s hard disk drive.

Sams speculates that specs for the new wave of consoles is expected to not be as important as it was with the Xbox One X, a console that can already deliver 4K/60FPS gaming. He suggests that the most significant change will be on the software side. A new technology called GameCore OS will enable Microsoft to bring Xbox One and PC development more closely together, apparently.

According to Sams, Microsoft may attempt to launch GameCore OS for all of the Xbox One family of devices. However, it’s unknown at this stage if this will unlock what Sams called “true forward and backwards compatibility.”

With Microsoft said to be pushing more into the PC development space (Halo Infinite is coming to Xbox One and PC), some may question if this will hurt Microsoft’s ability to sell consoles. As Sams reminds us, games–not hardware–is where the money is made. The margin profile of game sales are known to be better than hardware, where margins are low or even non-existent in some cases in history.

“That is not where you make money,” Phil Spencer told GeekWire about consoles. “The business inside of games is really selling games, and selling access to games and content in means like that is the fundamental business. So if you open it up, the more often people can play, the more they’re enjoying the art form. It increases the size of the business.”

xCloud And Game Pass

One of Microsoft’s most exciting and ambitious new technologies is the game-streaming service Project xCloud. Microsoft’s long-term vision is to bring Xbox to every internet-connected screen, whether that be a TV, console, or the mobile phone in your pocket. According to Sams, xCloud–or whatever name Microsoft decides to give it–will enter the trial phase later this year. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said that, during his holiday travels at the end of 2018, he was already playing streaming games on his phone as he jetted around, so it’s definitely coming together.

Nothing is certain yet, but it’s not hard to envision a future where Xbox Game Pass becomes an xCloud offering where people can stream games wherever they are, on whatever device they have. That’s exciting to think about. But there are numerous unanswered questions like whether the service will be available worldwide (PlayStation Now is notably unavailable in Australia), and if it will require Xbox Live Gold or not. Whatever the case, it may finally be time that streaming takes off, as Microsoft is joined by the likes of Google, Amazon, Verizon, and other tech juggernauts in having announced or rumoured to have game-streaming services in the pipeline.

Next Steps

Brad Sams reports that Microsoft will begin to discuss its next-generation plans with partners at the Game Developers Conference later this month in San Francisco. The show is aimed at developers and business executives, so whether or not these discussions take place behind-closed-doors or publicly remains to be seen. At the consumer-facing E3 show in June, the company will reportedly formally unveil the new consoles and discuss its plans at a high level.

Let's assume the sales figures only count per console, which i find hard to believe, why does it matter if they aren't critical successes? Recommend the console with the better games. Regardless of how 'few' buy them. The change the tag is coming, and I wouldn't exactly call it a feature. BC is a thing, but hardly anyone uses it. PS3 dropped it because no one used it. Custom gamerpics are a thing. What apps do you want? The equivalent is in their own brand headsets, the Gold and Plat are great. My ps4 wifi is the same as my xbox. PSNow is what you're thinking of, and it is by far the most popular version of that kind of service. Those screenshots will appear on your activity list. You can't pin apps, but you most recently used will appear on the list at the start and you can make folders, which is pretty much the same thing.

183377309904,3/11/2019,http://asadiwebnet.tumblr.com/post/183377309904,"I hope that the published patent application is not related to the final version of the product. Otherwise, Google has just discouraged me and many others to test my Project Stream. 

 We know with certainty that Google intends to significantly increase its investment in stays in the video game market. For today, the company has its fast-running Google Play Games service, but it is necessarily intended for so-called Sunday players - after all, it is almost exclusively about mobile games. 

 Project Stream, because this is the name of the Google service being tested, is supposed to be something similar to PlayStation Now , Project xCloud or GeForce Now . This means that games shared by it will not be counted locally, and in the cloud. The player will receive an audio-video stream, as in the case of VoD services. Of course, the difference is that it will be fully interactive. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrIodKaGpEM 

 For now, we only saw one game in Project Stream and it was a very impressive demonstration. Assassin’s Creed Odyssey worked on it in graphical settings similar to the level of Xbox One X with very few compression artifacts and definitely tolerable input lag (delayed response to commands from the gamepad to what we see on the screen). And it is a very complex technical and demanding game. 

 Google Project Stream will probably see a dedicated console. Gamepad is supposed to look like that. 

 The idea of ​​Project Stream is the ability to run games on any device equipped with a high-speed network card and the ability to quickly decode a high definition video stream. We expect, however, that - similarly to the Chromecast - Project Stream, there will be showcase equipment from Google. So the receiving device and the relevant controllers. Well, well … Houston, we have a problem. 

https://twitter.com/RepsUp100/status/1104259272517382145 

 The above render was created on the basis of the schemes from the Google patent application. We see on it a built-in microphone - probably with the ability to quickly call the Google Assistant - and a fairly standard set of buttons: two joysticks, four action buttons, so-called. cross, two drains and two front buttons. 

 However, this device does not look at all attractive or visually appealing. It looks like a cheap toy from a decade ago, which has no chance to lie comfortably in your hands. I have the impression that people who design the controller rather with video games have not had much in common so far. I find comfort only in the fact that the patenting of a project does not determine what the patenting entity actually wants to bring to market. 

 Project Stream is officially in less than two weeks. And I’m going back to Pixel phones with my thoughts. 

 Google is to disclose further details about Project Stream during the Games Developers Conference. I’m constantly thinking about going back to another important project of Google hardware department, which are Pixel phones. Probably the worst of the best Android phones. They have great cameras, although they’re probably not the best - it’s a fact. I will also put aside my reluctance to clean Android from Google, which I consider to be the least advanced, polished and comfortable version of this system. Let’s focus on the equipment. 



 Pixels are not the best designed. They are visually unattractive and the degree of advancement of the technological process used in them is best illustrated by the monstrous indentation in the Pixel 3 XL display. Unfortunately, they are also highly impermanent, as evidenced by numerous complaints about their USB port. 

 If the same team of engineers is working on Google’s console and gamepad, I personally feel that Project Stream is supposed to work on almost any electronic device. Which means we will be able to use the normal gamepad, not this - excuse me - a monster from Google.

This is a great article comparing the baseline versions (PS4 vs. Xbox One S): https://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-vs-ps4,review-2543.html It doesn't sound like you are currently a PC gamer who would benefit from the increased synergy between PC and Xbox One with things like its Play Anywhere initiative; meaning any of the games in that link you already purchased digitally for Windows on your PC you could already play for free on your TV in your living room with the Xbox One without having to purchase them again. XB1 also integrates better with PC peripherals like mice and keyboards. If you used to be an Xbox gamer and have a large library of old Xbox 360 (and even some original Xbox) games the Xbox One would also probably be preferred due to superior backwards compatibility. It's free. You can play all your old games. Sony wants to charge you $20/mo or $99/yr for their streaming PSNow service to play old games, and streaming from the cloud still isn't as stable, reliable, or convenient as playing from an old disc. But I don't recall seeing you in this subforum discussing old Xbox 360 or Xbox games. The lone advantage I might see for you for the Xbox One is as a media center. If you don't have a 4K Blu-Ray player this is a strong plus for the Xbox. It's flat out better all-around. Tom's Guide said: For sheer options, Xbox One is the superior entertainment machine. The system has the unique ability to transmit your cable box's TV signal, allowing you to quickly switch between playing a game and watching a show. The Xbox One S , Xbox One X and PS4 Pro can all stream 4K content, but only Microsoft's consoles can play 4K Blu-rays. Unlike PS4, Xbox One supports Dolby Atmos , allowing folks with compatible home theater products to enjoy immersive spatial sound, and will soon support Dolby Vision for improved HDR quality. The Xbox One is also the only console that features Kodi , a highly popular media server app that lets you access any movies, TV shows, images or songs you have stored on any of your devices around the house. Other than that, both PS4 and Xbox One cover most entertainment essentials, from major apps like Netflix and Hulu to more niche stuff like WWE Network and Crunchyroll. PS4 and Xbox One both offer Spotify , which lets you rock out to tunes in the background of whatever you're playing. Xbox One features a few other notable music services such as SoundCloud, Pandora and Deezer. Both consoles make it easy to cut cable. PS4 offers Sony's own PlayStation Vue online TV service (starting at $40 a month), which features lots of major cable channels, such as MTV and Nickelodeon; a slick interface; and a nearly limitless DVR. Xbox One owners have access to Sling TV , a similar online TV service that offers top networks such as ESPN and AMC for $20 a month, with add-on packages that bring in the likes of Epix and HBO. Even if you don't have cable or Sling, Xbox One has the ability to receive basic over-the-air live TV, as long as you have a separate antenna and adapter handy. Click to expand... The PS4 exclusive library crushes the Xbox One exclusive library, especially with action/adventure games, or any type of single player games (i.e. not online competitive multiplayer). For example, two of the three best AAA games of the past year were PS4 exclusives. Red Dead Redemption was multi-platform, but God of War and Marvel's Spider-Man were PS4 exclusives, and God of War won almost all the Game of the Year awards this past year. This has been true every year since launch. If you were big into competitive online shooters that is where the Xbox One shines because those are almost all multiplat, but you specifically said that isn't your thing.

When you play online, your own character responds instantly to player input because it is rendered by the local hardware. It's only other people's actions that has a delay. Obviously that makes a big difference to overall percieved lag. That said, none of the games on PSNow are (yet) optimized for streaming. There are various ways that developers can reduce streaming lag, such as rendering internally at very high framerates in order to minimize rendering lag (and thus cut down on overall lag). Ubisoft has made a version of Assassin's Creed Odyssey optimized for streaming. It's currently available to beta testers on Nintendo's and Google's upcoming streaming services. From what I've heard it performs very close to the regular version running on local hardware, as long as you have a high quality connection and aren't located too far from the server. Also, bandwidth and latency are two different things.

183261975174,3/6/2019,http://asadiwebnet.tumblr.com/post/183261975174,"Although three years have passed since the premiere of Dziki Gonu, no other producer of cRPG approached the level of the work created by CDP RED. The Witcher 3 remains a world phenomenon, which for some reason is now intensively promoted by Sony. On the PlayStation channel, you can find two great materials about Polish hit, both released in the last 24 hours. 

 All I need to do is remind Mr. Mirror who is spooning the spoon in the eye of a pub grub. An amazing, surprising, stupefying scene is one of the dozens of evidence that the narrative masterpiece is The Witcher 3. Until now, I have shivers when I remember the scenario of the addition of the Stone Heart. Olgiert, Geralt, Gaunter o'Dim … no geniuses. Just geniuses. 

 The phenomenon of The Witcher 3 is trying to capture PlayStation by promoting CDP RED on the YouTube channel. 

 In the last 24 hours, two materials have appeared on the official PlayStation channel on YouTube: The Origins of CD Projekt Red and How The Witcher Took Over The World . Both over 4-minute clips are well-deserved CDP RED awards at a very high level. Taste adds the fact that the narrator of both films is Doug Cockle - an actor who put his voice under Geralt in all three parts of the interactive The Witcher. Do you want to hear the White Wolf pronounce Cyberpunk 2077? No problem: 





 Of course, both materials are just a starter for the Witcher anecdotes series. Interesting stories related to Witcher are much more. Like, for example, that the player was initially to create his own witcher, Geralt would be one of the independent characters. Or the one about the never-realized The Witcher of 1997, for which Metropolis was responsible. Arek Kaminski from arhn.ue made a great material for this topic. Interesting is also the fact that initially CDP RED was played on the engine of the Polish FPS Mortyr. 

 Why is PlayStation now promoting Poles from CDP RED? 

 The question arises about the purposefulness of creating materials in three years from the original premiere of Dziki Gonko. Why is Sony dedicating to the Polish studio two materials in such a short space of time? After thinking for a moment, two answers come to me - one more likely, the other less. 

A more likely scenario assumes classic warming of the image and the involvement of the viewer. Recently, Sony has had some PR problems. For example, the one concerning the cross-play standard. CDP RED is one of the most talented and consumer-friendly developers. Heating in the radiance of the RED has never been bad for anyone, as Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz, for example, knows perfectly well. Perhaps the people responsible for PlayStation media wanted to do something positive, and the whole situation has no other bottom. 

 Accepting this variant, it’s only surprising that Sony has chosen CDP RED. We will arrange - Polish studio is not overly associated with PlayStation. Only Dziki Gon appeared on the console from the Sony family. Witcher 2 debuted on Xbox 360, while new Reds projects are presented on the Microsoft scene. It was no different in 2018 with Cyberpunk 2077. I am convinced that during this year’s E3 we will see Cyberpunk again during the Xbox conference. From this perspective, pumping the Reds seems puzzling. Here we come to the second variant. 

Less likely scenario is deliberate heating of the theme before the carefully planned announcement of the second The Witcher, and maybe even the whole trilogy on PS4. We have several companies specializing in creating ports in Poland that offer services at a truly global level. CDP RED could commission a remaster to an external entity, as mass publishers do today. It would not be the first time that Poles would take such a step. Witcher was about to appear on Xbox 360, but Redzi were not satisfied with the work of the contractor.

The Lost Legacy is a new game, and Shadow was remade from scratch using entirely new assets, not upresed ones. Click to expand... Lost Legacy was released as an expansion pack for Uncharted 4...and part of the season pass if you bought that. Why would it cost the same as a stand alone game? As far as Shadow, the ps3 “remaster” version was basically the HD version of the 2005 original with new assets for the ps3 in 2011. They charged $40 for that. That’s $10 less for a game that came out only 6 years before. Heck...they were still making and selling ps2’s in 2011! And the game looked/played basically the same with the better resolution/textures/frame rate. 6 years later they take the same game and redo its assists and textures and resolution for the ps4. And charge $40 again. But it’s still the same game/art direction/gameplay/style as the 2011/2005 version but yes...with development time by techies to make it look better on the ps4. New control scheme yes, but that is a minor change. What I’m saying is that LA Switch took develolment time to bring a 25 year old gameboy game and completely revamp it for a “modern” home console. It’s a completely different style and aesthetics and I’m assuming differences in gameplay to take advantage of Switch hardware that wasn’t available in 1993. They actually had to go through development time and effort to figure out what they wanted a 2018 Switch LA to look/feel like. There is simply just more time and effort involved for a complete remake like that compared to what Bluepoint Games did to bring their ps3 remaster to a ps4 remaster. Bluepoint and Sony new they couldn’t charge more than what they charged for the 2011 version (despite the new assists). They didn’t even dare charge what the original ps2 game costed! Mainly because ps4 gamers probably still had their ps2/ps3 version...or recently played that remaster through PSNow. Nintendo charging more for LA is simply the usual Nintendo premium (whether someone agrees with it or not: there are good arguments on both sides), it has nothing to do with the work involved. It certainly doesn't look like more work than other remakes like RE2, Ratchet, Shadow, Crash, Spyro, etc. Click to expand... I’m willing to be more people where involved in the LA remaster than the Shadow/Crash remasters, yea. You could argue whether it was needed or not, but I’m pretty sure Nintendo treated this development as they would any new console game. Also, what exactly makes you think Zelda will play so differently from the original? What gameplay changes do you expect? Click to expand... I’ve never know a Nintendo remaster on a home console to not change aspects of the game to fit the new hardware. I could be wrong, we’ll have to wait and see I guess! Click to expand... You honestly sound like someone who has never played any of those games and is just arguing for the sake of arguing that Nintendo is somehow putting more effort into this remake than all other remakes. LA doesn't require more work to remake than Shadow, Ratchet, RE2, Spyro and others, no. You are putting way too much emphasis on the fact that Nintendo went with a slightly plastic look in remaking the assets. That doesn't change the fact that the other games completely revamped their assets from scratch too (it's not an upres as you falsely claim), and for some, the scope is considerably bigger than LA given the big 3D worlds (take any one planet in Ratchet & Clank for example). It's even more obvious you don't know what you are talking about because these remakes did indeed make gameplay changes in line with modern standards, contrary to what you say. Movement and controls in Shadow were redone and Ratchet added completely new sections and gameplay options, just to name a few examples. If LA is full price it is because it is the usual Nintendo premium, it has nothing to do with more work being put in than other remakes.

Did you play RDR2? The game has ""latency"" issue with when you move Arthur and when he actually moves. People complained, and yet still finished the game. The biggest issue isnt internet speed anymore, it's how close you are to one of the servers. The minimum speed for a service like this, which, again, Sony is already doing, is 5 Mbps. DSL speeds. We have actual results already of people using a game streaming service with these speeds and no latency at all. Google has also done it. You keep posting about latency over and over in this topic, but don't actually say that real issue. Where you are relative to a server. It's the same issue CURRENT multiplayer games have, and one that Australians complain about every time a new game is released. They get put on servers with Asian countries that destroys the ping of the game. If you have a PC or a PS4, go try the 7 day trial of PSNOW, and try playing from your phone's hotspot connection.

This is a helpful characteristic, solely when you have a newer Mac that lets you stream anything that appears on your computer display, together with flash and/or free Hulu video wirelessly on to the Tv.


Don’t forget iTunes.

No option ====================::==================== I have experienced multiple hard crashes from using Anthem on different occasions when playing online with other people. When I first got the game, the game would completely quit on me, but as of recently and more importantly the last week, my console has crashed completely, saying that there needs to be an update and that there is a problem with the memory. I have a Playstation Slim and my PSN ID is zwilkoff. I haven't been able to use my Playstation for over a week now and when it tells me to get an external USB to download the update file on the system, it doesn't work. Every time I try to turn on my Playstation now, the controller doesn't really work and the PS4 never gets past 26% on the update. Along with this, the blue light on the PS4 flashes at random points and half the time, the PlayStation isn't turning on when I try to use the power switch. I feel as though this issue needs to be resolved soon because the fact that my whole system is destroyed because of this is absurd.

This is a great article comparing the baseline versions (PS4 vs. Xbox One S): https://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-vs-ps4,review-2543.html It doesn't sound like you are currently a PC gamer who would benefit from the increased synergy between PC and Xbox One with things like its Play Anywhere initiative; meaning any of the games in that link you already purchased digitally for Windows on your PC you could already play for free on your TV in your living room with the Xbox One without having to purchase them again. XB1 also integrates better with PC peripherals like mice and keyboards. If you used to be an Xbox gamer and have a large library of old Xbox 360 (and even some original Xbox) games the Xbox One would also probably be preferred due to superior backwards compatibility. It's free. You can play all your old games. Sony wants to charge you $20/mo or $99/yr for their streaming PSNow service to play old games, and streaming from the cloud still isn't as stable, reliable, or convenient as playing from an old disc. But I don't recall seeing you in this subforum discussing old Xbox 360 or Xbox games. The lone advantage I might see for you for the Xbox One is as a media center. If you don't have a 4K Blu-Ray player this is a strong plus for the Xbox. It's flat out better all-around. Tom's Guide said: For sheer options, Xbox One is the superior entertainment machine. The system has the unique ability to transmit your cable box's TV signal, allowing you to quickly switch between playing a game and watching a show. The Xbox One S , Xbox One X and PS4 Pro can all stream 4K content, but only Microsoft's consoles can play 4K Blu-rays. Unlike PS4, Xbox One supports Dolby Atmos , allowing folks with compatible home theater products to enjoy immersive spatial sound, and will soon support Dolby Vision for improved HDR quality. The Xbox One is also the only console that features Kodi , a highly popular media server app that lets you access any movies, TV shows, images or songs you have stored on any of your devices around the house. Other than that, both PS4 and Xbox One cover most entertainment essentials, from major apps like Netflix and Hulu to more niche stuff like WWE Network and Crunchyroll. PS4 and Xbox One both offer Spotify , which lets you rock out to tunes in the background of whatever you're playing. Xbox One features a few other notable music services such as SoundCloud, Pandora and Deezer. Both consoles make it easy to cut cable. PS4 offers Sony's own PlayStation Vue online TV service (starting at $40 a month), which features lots of major cable channels, such as MTV and Nickelodeon; a slick interface; and a nearly limitless DVR. Xbox One owners have access to Sling TV , a similar online TV service that offers top networks such as ESPN and AMC for $20 a month, with add-on packages that bring in the likes of Epix and HBO. Even if you don't have cable or Sling, Xbox One has the ability to receive basic over-the-air live TV, as long as you have a separate antenna and adapter handy. Click to expand... The PS4 exclusive library crushes the Xbox One exclusive library, especially with action/adventure games, or any type of single player games (i.e. not online competitive multiplayer). For example, two of the three best AAA games of the past year were PS4 exclusives. Read Dead Redemption was multi-platform, but God of War and Marvel's Spider-Man were PS4 exclusives, and God of War won almost all the Game of the Year awards this past year. This has been true every year since launch. If you were big into competitive online shooters that is where the Xbox One shines because those are almost all multiplat, but you specifically said that isn't your thing. This is the best resource to compare exclusives: https://gematsu.com/exclusives/ps4 https://gematsu.com/exclusives/xbox-one God of War Marvel's Spider-Man Horizon: Zero Dawn Bloodborne The Last of Us II (upcoming) The Last of Us: Remastered Uncharted 4: A Thief's End Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection The Last Guardian Ratchet & Clank The Order: 1886 Until Dawn Persona 5 Detroit: Become Human inFAMOUS: Second Son Undertale",,Madmick,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Gaming System....,,,

From Pitfall through to Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, we got our fix through platformers or point-and-click adventure games, but then 1996’s Tomb Raider melded the two together and perfected the action-adventure game - and it’s only grown in popularity since. The PC boasts some true classics of the genre, from classic tomb raiding to games with enough exploration to fill an entire sandbox - not the one in your backyard - so we’ve put together a list of the best action games around. This includes some of the finest games ever made on PC, action-adventure or otherwise, including several titles that changed the entire gaming industry. There’s no Uncharted here, as emulation or PlayStation Now doesn’t count, but we’d take any one of these games over Sony’s series. Here’s the definitive list of the best action-adventures on PC.

Of course, the other companies are free to do whatever they want, and the introduction of one of these companies into Nintendos operations may have changed their minds. Again, streaming games already exists in the US. Don't forget that pretty much all the corporations lie to push whatever they feel like pushing. Remember when MS said that the online activation thing is so ingrained into the Xbox that they would not be able to remove it.... until they did with a software update at launch? Or when Nintendo said there was no new DS planned about two weeks before they announced a new DS? Atarigamer posted... is it possible? yes of course. it's also possible to simply plug a usb HD into the dock but hey.. getting Nintendo to do it? good luck with that. Again, it's just not feasible, if you was using a USB hdd then undocking the Switch would be like taking out the game card/sdcard in the middle of gameplay. stop3 posted... My concern with streaming is they might make all the games low res like they do with PSnow. My internet can handle multiple 4K streams but psnow sets everything much much lower. The issue is that unlike streaming a movie, a big big BIG contributing factor to streaming games is latency.... which is completely separate from your speed by the way. You can have bad speeds but low latency or vice-versa, though a lot of times they are connected, and latency heavily effects gameplay. The higher the resolution the worse the latency can get too.",,Cyber Akuma Zero,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Google’s GDC 2019 game streaming service announcement: How to watch




 Screenshot by Lori Grunin/CNET


When you think of ways to play big-name video games, you probably think of Microsoft’s Xbox, Sony’s PlayStation or Nintendo’s Switch.

If Google has its way, you’ll soon be considering its Project Stream service too.

The tech giant is expected to announce a new streaming game service at a press event during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on March 19. Google already showed off the service running Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Odyssey during a public test late last year.

The service allows gamers to play standard PC games within Google’s Chrome browser. The games are powered by Google’s high-performance computers, which then stream the images to the web browser in a similar way Netflix streams videos. 

Google isn’t the only company doing this. Sony’s offered its PlayStation Now game streaming service since 2014, and chipmaker Nvidia offers one called GeForce Now. Microsoft is also readying an Xbox-related game streaming service, called Project xCloud, expected in the next couple of years.

In the meantime, Google drummed up interest in its streaming event when it posted a YouTube countdown page Tuesday, inviting visitors  to “Discover a new way to play.” The company also asks people to sign up to receive more information after its announcement.

Here are the details:

When?

Tuesday, March 19: 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET

Where?

We’ll have the livestream right here, so you can follow along in real time.

The event itself is happening in San Francisco, and the CNET team will be there.

What can we expect?

Rumors are Google will introduce both its streaming service and potentially a controller to go with it. Also, expect the company to talk about game partnerships with companies like Ubisoft, which it partnered with during its public trial.

I'm having the same issue as you after a few days of flawless gameplay as well. It's only been 4 days so I know the trial hasn't run out. The controller was working fine everywhere else, even in the Playstation now menu, so out of curiosity I decided to try a free trial on a different account and to my surprise the controller magically started working again. After that happened I decided to try the first account I made and boom, the controller wasn't working anymore. After jumping between both accounts numerous times I can confirm that the controller works on the second account, but not the first one. Whats up with that? I'm pretty disappointed by that. I got fairly far in Bloodborne within a short amount of time and now controllers simply do not work with that account anymore, not even a ps4 controller that I borrowed would. The paranoid side of me thinks that I somehow played too many hours within the trial period so the game is preventing me from going farther, but I know that's a bit extreme. I was seriously considering paying for this service too so I could play more Bloodborne however I am now reluctant to do so because in my mind either the controllers are not working as intended or the service is being dodgy.",,corrupt120,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The general consensus is that, as of now, it is worse than the xbox game pass for a number of reasons, queueing and no recent games in catalogue, but it's great to have it finally available in Italy with a bare minimum requirement of 5mbits, you know in Italy internet really sucks and is expensive af. That said: The service doesn't really appeal to me because I have ps1/2/3/4 still up and running and, among all four, I have a little more than two thousand titles. Moreover, until now, I had no problems in buying the games I was anticipating. But, if you are low on budget for whatever reason and you are not a long time collector (you don't ""own"" many games and don't mind not ""owning"" them) I think the yearly subscription is worth the 100€, and you don't need PSPlus to play online for the titles you are renting with Psnow.

183251344456,3/5/2019,http://bloodandshowtunes.tumblr.com/post/183251344456,"With about three months to go before E3 2019, Xbox rumours are already heating up. Microsoft has previously confirmed it is working on multiple new Xbox consoles, and now its plans appear to be coming into focus.

There is a lot of information out there about the new Xbox consoles, so we’re rounding up all the rumours and speculation into this post to help make sense of the matter. Bear in mind that while the sources for each rumour have proven reliable in the past, everything mentioned here is unconfirmed, and as with all rumours, plans are subject to change. Microsoft’s official stance is that it does not comment on rumour and speculation. With that caveat out of the way…

A Disc-Free Xbox One

Rumoured for many months already, and discussed at a conceptual level for years, the disc-free Xbox One is said to be codenamed Xbox Maverick. Windows Central reported that this system will actually be called “Xbox One S All-Digital Edition.” Pre-orders for the console are said to open in April, with the console then scheduled to go on sale in May around the world.

This would be a first for Microsoft, as all previous Xbox hardware featured a disc drive. Pricing hasn’t been mentioned in any reports yet, but dropping the disc drive would presumably lower the cost. In fact, it’s believed that the disc-free Xbox One would be the cheapest Xbox One offering to date.

Also unclear at this stage is if the disc-free Xbox One would contain any further changes to the Xbox One hardware or design. WindowsCentral posted a Photoshopped mock-up of what an Xbox One without a disc drive might look like–check it out here.

The video game industry, like film, TV, and music before it, is increasingly trending toward the digital space and away from physical media. Microsoft itself is pushing further into the digital space with its new streaming service Project xCloud, which according to Brad Sams, will enter a trial phase later this year. Another Microsoft digital subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, is proving popular already with millions of people signing up. It’s clear digital is important to Microsoft going forward.

All-digital hardware has been attempted before, as Sony launched the PSP Go back in 2009–but it failed. It’s been a decade since that trial, and general internet availability and speed has improved since then. Still, there are parts of the world where access to internet is limited, and other places where speeds are less-than-great (hello, Australia!). For those who prefer physical media, Microsoft will continue to make Xbox One consoles with disc-drives, so there is no need to worry about an all-digital future taking over, at least not yet.

The Disc-To-Digital Program

A key component of Microsoft’s disc-free Xbox One plans is what’s being referred to as the “disc-to-digital” program. As part of this, users can trade in their console discs for a digital license for games they already own. The disc-to-digital program is expected to launch around the same time as the disc-free Xbox One console’s release in May, or a little earlier, Brad Sams reported. People will be able to visit the Microsoft Store and Best Buy (and potentially others) to swap their discs for digital licenses. The specifics about how this will work remain unclear.

Retailers might not be very happy about this news, especially GameStop, whose “buy-sell-trade” business model hinges on physical media remaining popular. But no one is asking players to care about the health of retailers; if this is the way the business is going, retailers will need to adapt. For its part, GameStop has diversified its offerings substantially of late to focus more on digital options and physical content like Funko Pop! toys and other physical merchandise.

A New Fortnite Xbox One

Microsoft already offers an Xbox One hardware bundle that comes with Fortnite and various extras, but the company is reportedly planning to push even further on the battle royale game. A new Xbox One featuring a design inspired by Fortnite is coming, according to Windows Central, though the site didn’t have any further information about the system and if it will be an Xbox One S, X, or the new disc-free edition.

Next-Gen Consoles

Microsoft is reportedly working on multiple new Xbox One consoles in development under the “Scarlett” umbrella. The first is codenamed Anaconda, according to Brad Sams, and is the new high-power Xbox One to follow the Xbox One X that was released in November 2017. The other, codenamed Lockhart, is said to be the budget-oriented offering.

At E3 2019 in June, Microsoft is expected to discuss both of these consoles, though it’s unclear at this stage how deep into specifics the company plans to get. Sams reported that Microsoft’s idea with the new consoles is to “make next-gen gaming available to wider audiences with a lower price of entry.” The consoles aren’t expected to be released until Fall 2020.

According to Sams, the Anaconda console will be priced in line with Sony’s PlayStation 5 (which is rumoured but hasn’t been announced yet), while Lockhart will cost less.

Specs are unknown for Anaconda and Lockhart, but Sams reported that both consoles will have solid-state storage, which would be a big improvement over the Xbox One X’s hard disk drive.

Sams speculates that specs for the new wave of consoles is expected to not be as important as it was with the Xbox One X, a console that can already deliver 4K/60FPS gaming. He suggests that the most significant change will be on the software side. A new technology called GameCore OS will enable Microsoft to bring Xbox One and PC development more closely together, apparently.

According to Sams, Microsoft may attempt to launch GameCore OS for all of the Xbox One family of devices. However, it’s unknown at this stage if this will unlock what Sams called “true forward and backwards compatibility.”

With Microsoft said to be pushing more into the PC development space (Halo Infinite is coming to Xbox One and PC), some may question if this will hurt Microsoft’s ability to sell consoles. As Sams reminds us, games–not hardware–is where the money is made. The margin profile of game sales are known to be better than hardware, where margins are low or even non-existent in some cases in history.

“That is not where you make money,” Phil Spencer told GeekWire about consoles. “The business inside of games is really selling games, and selling access to games and content in means like that is the fundamental business. So if you open it up, the more often people can play, the more they’re enjoying the art form. It increases the size of the business.”

xCloud And Game Pass

One of Microsoft’s most exciting and ambitious new technologies is the game-streaming service Project xCloud. Microsoft’s long-term vision is to bring Xbox to every internet-connected screen, whether that be a TV, console, or the mobile phone in your pocket. According to Sams, xCloud–or whatever name Microsoft decides to give it–will enter the trial phase later this year. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said that, during his holiday travels at the end of 2018, he was already playing streaming games on his phone as he jetted around, so it’s definitely coming together.

Nothing is certain yet, but it’s not hard to envision a future where Xbox Game Pass becomes an xCloud offering where people can stream games wherever they are, on whatever device they have. That’s exciting to think about. But there are numerous unanswered questions like whether the service will be available worldwide (PlayStation Now is notably unavailable in Australia), and if it will require Xbox Live Gold or not. Whatever the case, it may finally be time that streaming takes off, as Microsoft is joined by the likes of Google, Amazon, Verizon, and other tech juggernauts in having announced or rumoured to have game-streaming services in the pipeline.

Next Steps

Brad Sams reports that Microsoft will begin to discuss its next-generation plans with partners at the Game Developers Conference later this month in San Francisco. The show is aimed at developers and business executives, so whether or not these discussions take place behind-closed-doors or publicly remains to be seen. At the consumer-facing E3 show in June, the company will reportedly formally unveil the new consoles and discuss its plans at a high level.

Basically Google and MS know Sony cannot compete via streaming, so they're basically hijacking the market out from under them. The same way Apple hoodwinked music from Sony.

Sony said in a recent press release that they are absolutely looking at streaming games in the future but that tech just isn’t there yet. And they’re 100% correct.

In that case, I'd like a mini-PS4 with its own screen or a mini Xbox one with its own screen. And it would need to be able to run games off an SD card instead of disc. It would be cool too if they incorporated an NFC reader too since they've always been missing one on those systems. Also wifi would need to be in to allow all games to be played in local multiplayer mode.Now, that would be incredible. honestly, I hope both of them just invest more in ""remote play"". Xbox is talking about streaming a lot and between remote play and PSnow, we really should be getting closer to having TV's, web browsers, tablets, etc being able to stream the stuff. Providing the controller can connect to it, that sort of thing seems the ideal direction for them. Just because no (extra) hardware is involved and neither could support their own portable hardware. But that? they could do that. >_> or yeah, theoretically, they could be apps on the switch too. Rorrrr posted... Those past products were ad ons, the switchs whole selling point is that it can switch between handheld and on the TV. The switch mini would need its own dock if it were even to have one. But again that’s the point of the switch. It’s marketed to have a dock, so forcing people to buy a new one or remove the function are terrible options. the whole selling point of the Gameboy line was handheld gaming. nobody cares about the ""selling point"" besides the people desperate to argue this will never happen because ""I don't want it to happen"". And lol, this is Nintendo, they'd LOVE you to buy more controllers. Why do you think they made the classic controller for the wii and WiiU? they know people want it and its more money for them Rorrrr posted... Connecting controllers wirelessly with controllers already attached? Do I need to explain why this is a bad idea? its called tabletop mode, as you would already be able to play in handheld mode. Its not a bad idea, unless you are mistakenly assuming both controllers would be active as the same ""player 1"" (they would not) Rorrrr posted... And still: what’s the point of a switch mini? To make it smaller? Why? more kid friendly. more portable. more ""not like the current switch"" so they can help sell it to more people. A bulkier Switch ""pro"" would have the same logic behind it. To help sell it to more people Rorrrr posted... That doesn’t answer:WHY? why what? the fact is we know redesigns exist. we know some have been smaller (and some bigger and some with some gimmicky extra). We know Nintendo loves redesigns for their handhelds. we know they will do something to ensure they retain momentum and sell even more switch systems (ie: a redesign). People assume a switch mini is coming before a switch pro just because. both are just as likely, but a switch mini would be better first (so a pro can benefit more from graphical boosts later on)",,MrMegaPhoenix,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

34c37252-5405-4499-8adc-d3f143e5096c,3/13/2019,https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/4751978#entry92089279,"Normally, Google showing up to the Game Developers Conference isn't a huge deal. The company does this pretty much every year—Android smartphones and Google Play are a pretty big gaming platform, after all—and it shows up with livestreams and blog posts and all the usual festivities. This year, though, is different. Google has been sending out vague teasers since last month for a GDC event, but as the date approaches, the company has been dropping more and more hints of exactly what it is announcing: Google is launching video game hardware for the Project Stream platform. A new YouTube video for the event posted today asks people to ""Gather around as we unveil Google’s vision for the future of gaming at GDC19."" Google recently wrapped up the ""Project Stream"" beta test, which streamed a full version of Assassin's Creed: Odyssey from the Internet to any desktop version of Chrome. A game-streaming platform certainly fits a vision for the future of gaming, but this is still just a piece of software. Google hardware There are two big pieces of evidence that this is a hardware announcement. First, Google is a heavily compartmentalized company, and the person promoting this event on Twitter is none other than Risk Osterloh, Google's senior vice president of Hardware. Osterloh is behind the division that brought us the Pixel phone, Google Home, and every other Google hardware product. His involvement is a solid sign that, yes, new hardware is coming. The second big piece of evidence is that Google is also hosting a teaser page on store.google.com. The Google Store. The Google Hardware Store. Google could host a teaser page at any of its thousands of sub-domains, but for some mysterious reason, it picked the Google Store. The ""Google Store"" doesn't sell software—that would be ""Google Play."" The Google Store only sells hardware—things like smartphones and tablets and laptops and Google Home speakers. Soon, apparently, it will sell video game hardware. According to a report from The Information (subscription required), Google's gaming hardware was reportedly codenamed ""Yeti"" and has been in the works at Google for over three years now. We can only guess at what Google gaming hardware might look like. In 2014, the company co-designed the Google Nexus Player with Asus, which was a dead-simple combination of some smartphone parts in a disk-shaped box, a TV remote, and a generic, Xbox-style game controller. That device was primarily an Android TV box, but a game streaming console could look similar to this. There was also this Google patent of a generic-looking game controller that made the news rounds the other day. The patent involved pushing notifications to the controller, which could be interesting, and the drawings show Android-y hardware buttons—home, menu, and microphone—presumably for Google voice commands. The controller also acted as your authentication token, storing user information like your Google account and settings and using a button combination as a password. This patent was from 2014, though, so it's hard to know if it is at all relevant. Companies patent every single idea they have, and random patents aren't necessarily indicative of future plans. Another option is just to use the Google Chromecast. The Information's Yeti report noted that ""an early version"" of Project Stream originally ran on Google's existing streaming stick, just with a controller paired to it. At the time we didn't know of a way to pair a controller to a Chromecast, since the devices didn't support Bluetooth or any other way to hook up a controller. Months later, a third-generation Chromecast started showing up in stores, packing—wouldn't you know it—Bluetooth. As far as we know, there is no official explanation for the new Chromecast's Bluetooth support. So maybe Rick Osterloh will walk up on stage at GDC, hold up a game controller, and say ""Anyone that bought a Chromecast in the last six months now owns the Google game console."" Mic drop, exit stage right. Google infrastructure Enlarge / The Internet is a series of tubes—like these cooling pipes in Google's Oregon data center. Google Numerous companies have tried game streaming in the past, most notably Sony with the PlayStation Now and Nvidia with Geforce Now. Microsoft is jumping into the game with ""Project Xcloud,"" which is powered by literal Xboxes acting as blade servers. Sony and Microsoft both have existing traditional console businesses to safeguard, though, and Nvidia wants to sell graphics cards. Google is the only gaming newcomer that doesn't have an existing business to protect. While Google isn't a gaming powerhouse, it is an internet infrastructure powerhouse. This could come in handy for a game streaming service that is heavily dependent on network performance and shipping video around the world. Google, of course, runs some of the most popular sites on the Web, including Google.com and YouTube, the latter of which is one of the biggest bandwidth users on the Internet. Google's pioneering data center work is one of the key reasons sites like YouTube can afford to exist. Google has constantly worked to make the Web cheaper, faster, and lower latency, and today the company has a hand in pretty much every aspect of the Internet, from browsers to ISPs to protocols to fiber backbone. If Google really wants to invest in making low-latency game streaming a reality, there is plenty it can bring to the table. Google... Games? Having hardware and a streaming platform is nice, but it doesn't matter one bit if you don't have any games to play. A Kotaku report from the middle of last year said Google was pursuing ""aggressive recruiting or even major acquisitions"" in the games industry to try to build a library for its gaming platform. There's a good chance former Xbox and PlayStation executive Phil Harrison was involved in those negotiations, as Google hired him at the beginning of 2018. Another big hire was just announced recently: Google snapped up former Ubisoft and EA executive Jade Raymond. Raymond will be VP of an undisclosed division at Google. It sounds like she's not allowed to talk about it right now. Google's press conference is March 19 at 10am Pacific. There will be a live stream here. https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/all...ncement-at-gdc/ Anybody can post tldr?

Sony and Microsoft are both aware that the future of gaming lies in making it ubiquitous by enabling mobile devices to host core gaming content (via streaming). Sony was somewhat ahead of the curve with Remote Play between Vita and PS4. They had plans for PlayStation Now to be available on mobile devices, but for some reason they dropped that. I'm sure due to Switch's dominance, they're looking into making PS5 have some sort of portable feature. And of course Microsoft has made it pretty clear that they're onboard with this direction via their Project xCloud.

183261368754,3/6/2019,http://asadiwebnet.tumblr.com/post/183261368754,"Although three years have passed since the premiere of Dziki Gonu, no other producer of cRPG approached the level of the work created by CDP RED. The Witcher 3 remains a world phenomenon, which for some reason is now intensively promoted by Sony. On the PlayStation channel, you can find two great materials about Polish hit, both released in the last 24 hours. 

 All I need to do is remind Mr. Mirror who is spooning the spoon in the eye of a pub grub. An amazing, surprising, stupefying scene is one of the dozens of evidence that the narrative masterpiece is The Witcher 3. Until now, I have shivers when I remember the scenario of the addition of the Stone Heart. Olgiert, Geralt, Gaunter o'Dim … no geniuses. Just geniuses. 

 The phenomenon of The Witcher 3 is trying to capture PlayStation by promoting CDP RED on the YouTube channel. 

 In the last 24 hours, two materials have appeared on the official PlayStation channel on YouTube: The Origins of CD Projekt Red and How The Witcher Took Over The World . Both over 4-minute clips are well-deserved CDP RED awards at a very high level. Taste adds the fact that the narrator of both films is Doug Cockle - an actor who put his voice under Geralt in all three parts of the interactive The Witcher. Do you want to hear the White Wolf pronounce Cyberpunk 2077? No problem: 





 Of course, both materials are just a starter for the Witcher anecdotes series. Interesting stories related to Witcher are much more. Like, for example, that the player was initially to create his own witcher, Geralt would be one of the independent characters. Or the one about the never-realized The Witcher of 1997, for which Metropolis was responsible. Arek Kaminski from arhn.ue made a great material for this topic. Interesting is also the fact that initially CDP RED was played on the engine of the Polish FPS Mortyr. 

 Why is PlayStation now promoting Poles from CDP RED? 

 The question arises about the purposefulness of creating materials in three years from the original premiere of Dziki Gonko. Why is Sony dedicating to the Polish studio two materials in such a short space of time? After thinking for a moment, two answers come to me - one more likely, the other less. 

A more likely scenario assumes classic warming of the image and the involvement of the viewer. Recently, Sony has had some PR problems. For example, the one concerning the cross-play standard. CDP RED is one of the most talented and consumer-friendly developers. Heating in the radiance of the RED has never been bad for anyone, as Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz, for example, knows perfectly well. Perhaps the people responsible for PlayStation media wanted to do something positive, and the whole situation has no other bottom. 

 Accepting this variant, it’s only surprising that Sony has chosen CDP RED. We will arrange - Polish studio is not overly associated with PlayStation. Only Dziki Gon appeared on the console from the Sony family. Witcher 2 debuted on Xbox 360, while new Reds projects are presented on the Microsoft scene. It was no different in 2018 with Cyberpunk 2077. I am convinced that during this year’s E3 we will see Cyberpunk again during the Xbox conference. From this perspective, pumping the Reds seems puzzling. Here we come to the second variant. 

Less likely scenario is deliberate heating of the theme before the carefully planned announcement of the second The Witcher, and maybe even the whole trilogy on PS4. We have several companies specializing in creating ports in Poland that offer services at a truly global level. CDP RED could commission a remaster to an external entity, as mass publishers do today. It would not be the first time that Poles would take such a step. Witcher was about to appear on Xbox 360, but Redzi were not satisfied with the work of the contractor.

While the tech still isn't perfect, Google's Project Stream has already proved that high-fidelity, low-latency gaming is possible with nothing more than a halfway-decent internet connection. Even Sony already has PlayStation Now -- its own game streaming service -- but today, the company has decided to branch out a bit more. Whereas PlayStation Now requires a computer to function, the company's new PS4 Remote Play app enables users to play their PS4 games on their iPhone or iPad. Obviously, Remote Play is not the ideal way to play PS4 titles. Unless you have a third-party mobile controller, you're going to have to rely on the app's on-screen PS4 button equivalents, which take up quite a bit of space and don't seem all that intuitive to use. Regardless, for slower-paced games where rapid responses aren't the difference between life and death, Remote Play could be a fun way to take your games with you from place to place; provided you have a solid internet connection (playing over cellular data is reportedly not supported). If your connection is a bit spotty, you're not totally out of luck. According to Ars Technica , Remote Play features 360p, 540p, and 720p quality options for precisely that reason. If you want to try out Remote Play for yourself, just update your PS4 and snag the app itself from the iOS App Store. It's unclear whether or not Android support will arrive anytime soon.

183303155598,3/7/2019,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/183303155598,"The idea of playing games through a cloud streaming service is trending upward due to the likes of Sony’s PSNow, Google Project Stream’s early test run with Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, and Nvidia’s GeForce Now. And many signs point to cloud-based gaming being the next big shift in the industry with names like Microsoft and Amazon making moves in this space. Right now, French company Blade has a stake in cloud gaming with its Shadow streaming service and Shadow Ghost set-top box (an improved version of the Shadow Box we reviewed last year).

Blade has been expanding the reach of its service–it was previously only available in California for US customers, but is now currently available in most states in the US, the UK, Germany, and France. And I spent several hours using Shadow on a MacBook Air and the Shadow Ghost to see if this setup is a viable solution for those looking for a mid/high-end gaming PC.
The Shadow Ghost set-top box runs the application and gets you access to your virtual PC.
How It Works

Any device that runs Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10, macOS 10.10 or later, Android 7.0 Nougat or later, or iOS 11.0 or later can run the Shadow application and essentially turn into a gaming PC (Ubuntu support is currently in beta). You’ll also have to pay $35 USD per month–or $30 per month on a year-long commitment–and use an internet connection that’s fast and stable enough. This isn’t a Netflix-style service, or a parallel to Xbox Game Pass since you’re not subscribing for access to games, you’re subscribing to a powerful Windows 10 PC.

In a sense, Shadow functions similarly to any other video streaming service since you’re simply getting video feed of a PC you’re controlling remotely (located at the closest data center to you). As of now, you can set a Shadow stream bit rate to run between 5 Mbps to 70 Mbps which dictates the visual quality of the stream; just be sure you have the proper bandwidth and are aware of any data limitations you may have. Blade recommends having at least a modest 25 Mbps connection and suggests using wired connections for reliability.

As for the set-top box, the Shadow Ghost is a slimmed-down version of Blade’s previous hardware offering, the Shadow Box. Aside from the redesign that includes significantly condensed dimensions, Ghost has its ports in a more sensible configuration–they’re all neatly positioned on one side of the device and offers one HDMI out instead of two DisplayPort outs. Otherwise, the box serves the same purpose and goes for $140 USD (subscription not included).

Shadow Ghost–the local hardware that can run the service–has the necessary ports for a fully functional PC. This makes Ghost ideal for living room or home theater setups, and if you’re not looking to use another compatible device to control your Shadow PC. Regardless of whether you use the application or the Ghost, Shadow presents you with a home menu to configure settings and access your account. From there, you boot your virtual PC and start getting feed of the Windows 10 desktop.
The Shadow app for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android gives you access to your virtual PC remotely.
Technical Specifications

The Ghost itself features two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI out, one 3.5mm audio jack, and an Ethernet port. It’s powered by a 5V DC plug and runs completely silent since there are no fans. As far as wireless capabilities, it features dual-band WiFi for up to 400 Mbps and Bluetooth 4.1 support. A keyboard and mouse are required to at least navigate the Ghost’s menus and Windows desktop.

When it comes to actual hardware that runs the games you’re streaming, Shadow packs some fairly beefy specs. Blade says that it’ll upgrade Shadow’s specs free of charge in the future, so you’ll be getting a better PC for the same price down the road. But for now, this is the PC you’ll be working with:

 * OS: Windows 10 Home Edition
 * CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2678 v3 @ 2.5GHz
 * GPU: Nvidia Quadro P5000
 * Memory: 12 GB
 * Storage: 256 GB QEMU Drive
 * Connection Speed: 805 Mbps down, 106 Mbps up, 1 ms latency
One thing jumps out when taking a quick look at the spec sheet; you only get 256 GB of storage space. In the modern era where the latest games can take up well above 50 GB, your Shadow drive will fill up fast. For example, I was only able to have Anthem, Apex Legends, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, and Metro Exodus installed at once with very little room left. Unfortunately, Blade currently doesn’t offer any subscription options that grant you more storage space.

This isn’t a Netflix-style service, or a parallel to Xbox Game Pass since you’re not subscribing for access to games, you’re subscribing to a powerful Windows 10 PC.

If it’s any consolation, your virtual PC accesses an internet connection that’s rated at 805 Mbps down according to Google’s own speed test. This makes games incredibly fast to download; Origin and Uplay were all downloading games at around 130 Mbps. In a way, you’re getting access to gigabit internet via Shadow. Remember, you’re not using your own connection to download games since you’re controlling a PC remotely, but keep in mind that you are using your own bandwidth to stream.

It may sound odd that Shadow’s cloud-based PCs use Nvidia Quadro P5000 workstation video cards as opposed to the more common GeForce gaming lineup–the rough equivalent would be a GTX 1080 in this case. And the same can be said about having an Intel Xeon E5 instead of the popular Intel Core i7 CPUs. Regardless, these specs make for a very capable gaming rig, if you’re not expecting to run 4K with high settings in the latest games at 60 FPS.

Performance And Experience

In terms of performance metrics, I used the Final Fantasy XV benchmark to get a gauge of how the system’s Quadro P5000 video card stacks up against more common cards. At 4K using the High settings preset, the FFXV benchmark gave a score of 3132, which roughly translates to an average of 31 FPS. This puts the Quadro P5000 right next to the GTX 1070 Ti and slightly below a GTX 1080, which are both formidable mid/high-end cards. For an idea of how it can handle 1080p using max settings in a graphically demanding game, we turned to the Assassin’s Creed Odyssey benchmark, in which it got an average of 49 FPS.

One big concern when it comes to cloud-based gaming is latency, but you can largely put that to rest. The moment-to-moment gameplay experience using Shadow Ghost is undoubtedly impressive with little to no perceivable input lag. Games like Anthem, which move fast and pack a ton of action at any given moment, played so well that I soon forgot it was being streamed. This means that other games with forgiving windows for timing and less emphasis on speed, such as Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, flow smooth and play nearly indistinguishable from a local PC. The level of performance Shadow delivers considering the asking price is quite impressive, but you probably don’t want to rely on it for competitive games that move super-fast and emphasize twitch reactions.

I was able to stay competitive throughout my few hours with Apex Legends using Shadow, but hitches in the streaming feed were a lot more noticeable by nature of the game’s speed and style. It rarely tripped me up, but having a stutter during an intense high-stakes firefight is less than ideal, which happens more frequently when using a wireless connection. I connected to a a WiFi network that had a 200 Mbps download speed and 5 ms latency reading, but hitches tended to happen at regular intervals and bogged down my experience in Apex Legends. It’s readily apparent in audio; if you listen to a steady, sustained sound effect such as a waterfall in Anthem or simply listen to a song, you’ll easily pick up on this issue.

I think what I imagined as ""console"" versions of 3DS games was out of whack, especially after seeing what id Tech could do. I can't say I'm disappointed cause they do make Switch feel more like a handheld, which is what I want, these are exactly what I would have wanted for 3DS game sequels. If 3DS wasn't getting so old, I'd say I wished I could just get them on 3DS. In a way, I sort of preferred the lesser quality for the $40 price tag. In that regard, I don't feel the games are as good as I would want or just not use to seeing them in same price bracket as definitive console games like Metroid Prime 4 and Mario Odyssey, who in general just feel like way more game and way more budget. Just wondering if Fire Emblem and Pokemon as good as you imagined? ====================::==================== phantomx said: ↑ the_wire30 said: ↑ [Quote: =""phantomx, post Um, no? The Lost Legacy is a new game, and Shadow was remade from scratch using entirely new assets, not upresed ones. Click to expand... Lost Legacy was released as an expansion pack for Uncharted 4...and part of the season pass if you bought that. Why would it cost the same as a stand alone game? As far as Shadow, the ps3 “remaster” version was basically the HD version of the 2005 original with new assets for the ps3 in 2011. They charged $40 for that. That’s $10 less for a game that came out only 6 years before. Heck...they were still making and selling ps2’s in 2011! And the game looked/played basically the same with the better resolution/textures/frame rate. 6 years later they take the same game and redo its assists and textures and resolution for the ps4. And charge $40 again. But it’s still the same game/art direction/gameplay/style as the 2011/2005 version but yes...with development time by techies to make it look better on the ps4. New control scheme yes, but that is a minor change. What I’m saying is that LA Switch took develolment time to bring a 25 year old gameboy game and completely revamp it for a “modern” home console. It’s a completely different style and aesthetics and I’m assuming differences in gameplay to take advantage of Switch hardware that wasn’t available in 1993. They actually had to go through development time and effort to figure out what they wanted a 2018 Switch LA to look/feel like. There is simply just more time and effort involved for a complete remake like that compared to what Bluepoint Games did to bring their ps3 remaster to a ps4 remaster. Bluepoint and Sony new they couldn’t charge more than what they charged for the 2011 version (despite the new assists). They didn’t even dare charge what the original ps2 game costed! Mainly because ps4 gamers probably still had their ps2/ps3 version...or recently played that remaster through PSNow. Nintendo charging more for LA is simply the usual Nintendo premium (whether someone agrees with it or not: there are good arguments on both sides), it has nothing to do with the work involved. It certainly doesn't look like more work than other remakes like RE2, Ratchet, Shadow, Crash, Spyro, etc. Click to expand... I’m willing to be more people where involved in the LA remaster than the Shadow/Crash remasters, yea. You could argue whether it was needed or not, but I’m pretty sure Nintendo treated this development as they would any new console game. Also, what exactly makes you think Zelda will play so differently from the original? What gameplay changes do you expect? Click to expand... I’ve never know a Nintendo remaster on a home console to not change aspects of the game to fit the new hardware. I could be wrong, we’ll have to wait and see I guess! Click to expand... You honestly sound like someone who has never played any of those games and is just arguing for the sake of arguing that Nintendo is somehow putting more effort into this remake than all other remakes. LA doesn't require more work to remake than Shadow, Ratchet, RE2, Spyro and others, no. You are putting way too much emphasis on the fact that Nintendo went with a slightly plastic look in remaking the assets. That doesn't change the fact that the other games completely revamped their assets from scratch too (it's not an upres as you falsely claim), and for some, the scope is considerably bigger than LA given the big 3D worlds (take any one planet in Ratchet & Clank for example). It's even more obvious you don't know what you are talking about because these remakes did indeed make gameplay changes in line with modern standards, contrary to what you say. Movement and controls in Shadow were redone and Ratchet added completely new sections and gameplay options, just to name a few examples. If LA is full price it is because it is the usual Nintendo premium, it has nothing to do with more work being put in than other remakes.

Rather its to utilize PS5 back-compatibility PS1-PS4 to allow PSNow to download all games which are all remote play enabled. Essentially your own console becomes the remote server and allows you to play all your existing games on various devices for no cost. I really hoping this happens, I have no OG PSX or PS2 games or consoles, so I'd really like that. It works now. If you have the couple of digital PS1/PS2 games on PS4 you can remote play them. I have PSNow and download the PS2 classics and use it through remote play. Dark Cloud and Rogue Galaxy are amazing via remote play.",,michaelmikado,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

My concern with streaming is they might make all the games low res like they do with PSnow. My internet can handle multiple 4K streams but psnow sets everything much much lower. The issue is that unlike streaming a movie, a big big BIG contributing factor to streaming games is latency.... which is completely separate from your speed by the way. You can have bad speeds but low latency or vice-versa, though a lot of times they are connected, and latency heavily effects gameplay. The higher the resolution the worse the latency can get too. My point being that the PS4 has a game streaming service and it looks like blurry low res crap with artifacting all over the place. That makes it very hard to get excited about streaming low res versions of Xbox games to my Switch.",,stop3,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I remember back in 2009 and 2010 When most platinum trophies took some serious time to earn. Now we have lots of games where you can get a platinum in less than an hour. Some of them are pure trash. You can tell they were made just for a quick buck from the developer. But on the other hand some are actually decent games. I really enjoyed a recent game called JackQuest. It's a easy platinum to obtain but I thought it was a decent game. My question is this. What quick platinum trophies do you think are actually good and worth it and which ones are garbage. I myself have some really respectable hard to earn platinum trophies (In my opinion anyway) and I definitely have some garbage ones too. (Mayo, Orc Slayer, etc) Just saying lol. So I was just wondering what the community thought. ====================::==================== 16 minutes ago, Matrim_Drasgen said: Gem Smashers - I saw this game on a friend's profile and thought it looked really neat and fun to play.

But for Sony, who currently has the lead, but who's also being seen slightly as anti-consumer in the recent couple years, could take advantage of a disc-less PS4 not only to push the brand and maybe add enough sales to meet the PS2, but to have an excuse to drop the PS4's price via this method to $99. with virtually all PS4 games receiving a digital edition, and the pricing getting better – particularly in key regions like the United States. Regular discounts and promotions mean that it is now viable to download the vast majority of your games, and extendable storage solutions means that you’ll always have an abundance of space. Plus, with Digital becoming a significant percentage of game sales, and Sony's shifting focus to NOW and VUE, this could be a great idea. With Sony's current strategy on the PS4, the only thing that would change is no physical Blu-ray for movies, which would be the only real net loss if Sony brings out a disc-less streaming PS4. But most people are fine with Digital 4k HDR. What do you think? We already had the Pstv with Psnow app and ability to play ps4 ps3 games. Once again Sony was ahead of the curve.

Most of the big things this generation are going to be more software based policies, and software can be changed MUCH more quickly than hardware and those initial ""screw-ups"" won't haunt you for the entire gen. For instance Sony could decide to lock previous generation games behind the PSNow paywall, but could fix that if needed relatively easily. Compare that with MS's screwup with the Kinect, which caused the internal component to be lessened and lowered the ""base"" that programmers had to take in to account even after the hardware was improved. So, in short yes Sony can get just as arrogant, but the landscape we stand in today kind of makes it hard to make a mistake that has as large and long lasting effect on the platform.",,Steppy_76,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

It’s unclear as to what Jade is Vice President of at Google, but fans of her work can only speculate she is going to be dabbling in something to do with producing a new gaming franchise. Jade announced on her Twitter page her new position. In Jade’s recent position she worked as senior vice president group general manager of Motive Studios. She was responsible for orchestrating many developments such as a new business unit, studio team members centered on creating new IP software and action games. Raymond also lead the strategy around Star Wars games and in October of 2018 she left to pursue other interests. Google runs a gaming business with its Project Stream technology that is set to be disclosed during the next Gaming Developers Conference. Google also released the vague video game teaser that displayed a variety of environments which seems to show many genres such as sports, racing, action and fantasy. Google mentioned that the short trailer showcases their vision for future gaming. Last year in 2018 Google joined forces with Ubisoft to test its Project Stream technology that made Assassin’s Creed Odyssey playable on a Google Chrome browser. Rumors have surfaced saying Google may be ready to launch its own game-streaming service that adds onto the process Google has done with its Project Stream tests. Word also has been spread that there could be some hardware that comes along with it, as a patent for a controller surfaced last week. Jade will be joining two other high-profile gaming executives at Google this year such as Phil Harrison. The former PlayStation and Xbox boss as will be one of Google’s VP and Jack Buser who was the previous director of PlayStation Now and PlayStation Home.

183377308334,3/11/2019,http://asadiwebnet.tumblr.com/post/183377308334,"I hope that the published patent application is not related to the final version of the product. Otherwise, Google has just discouraged me and many others to test my Project Stream. 

 We know with certainty that Google intends to significantly increase its investment in stays in the video game market. For today, the company has its fast-running Google Play Games service, but it is necessarily intended for so-called Sunday players - after all, it is almost exclusively about mobile games. 

 Project Stream, because this is the name of the Google service being tested, is supposed to be something similar to PlayStation Now , Project xCloud or GeForce Now . This means that games shared by it will not be counted locally, and in the cloud. The player will receive an audio-video stream, as in the case of VoD services. Of course, the difference is that it will be fully interactive. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrIodKaGpEM 

 For now, we only saw one game in Project Stream and it was a very impressive demonstration. Assassin’s Creed Odyssey worked on it in graphical settings similar to the level of Xbox One X with very few compression artifacts and definitely tolerable input lag (delayed response to commands from the gamepad to what we see on the screen). And it is a very complex technical and demanding game. 

 Google Project Stream will probably see a dedicated console. Gamepad is supposed to look like that. 

 The idea of ​​Project Stream is the ability to run games on any device equipped with a high-speed network card and the ability to quickly decode a high definition video stream. We expect, however, that - similarly to the Chromecast - Project Stream, there will be showcase equipment from Google. So the receiving device and the relevant controllers. Well, well … Houston, we have a problem. 

https://twitter.com/RepsUp100/status/1104259272517382145 

 The above render was created on the basis of the schemes from the Google patent application. We see on it a built-in microphone - probably with the ability to quickly call the Google Assistant - and a fairly standard set of buttons: two joysticks, four action buttons, so-called. cross, two drains and two front buttons. 

 However, this device does not look at all attractive or visually appealing. It looks like a cheap toy from a decade ago, which has no chance to lie comfortably in your hands. I have the impression that people who design the controller rather with video games have not had much in common so far. I find comfort only in the fact that the patenting of a project does not determine what the patenting entity actually wants to bring to market. 

 Project Stream is officially in less than two weeks. And I’m going back to Pixel phones with my thoughts. 

 Google is to disclose further details about Project Stream during the Games Developers Conference. I’m constantly thinking about going back to another important project of Google hardware department, which are Pixel phones. Probably the worst of the best Android phones. They have great cameras, although they’re probably not the best - it’s a fact. I will also put aside my reluctance to clean Android from Google, which I consider to be the least advanced, polished and comfortable version of this system. Let’s focus on the equipment. 



 Pixels are not the best designed. They are visually unattractive and the degree of advancement of the technological process used in them is best illustrated by the monstrous indentation in the Pixel 3 XL display. Unfortunately, they are also highly impermanent, as evidenced by numerous complaints about their USB port. 

 If the same team of engineers is working on Google’s console and gamepad, I personally feel that Project Stream is supposed to work on almost any electronic device. Which means we will be able to use the normal gamepad, not this - excuse me - a monster from Google.

Since the original *Katamari Damacy*'s release on the PS2 in 2004, a new entry to the series was created for each new Sony console: * **PSP** — *Me & My Katamari* — Despite the system's lack of dual thumbsticks and limited horsepower, the team made it work. * **PS3** — *Katamari Forever* — The console missed out on the 7th Generation's first *Katamari* title, which was only released for Xbox 360, the series eventually returned to its home. * **Vita** — *Touch My Katamari* — A launch title for the system, this version was thin on content and not received very well by fans. Alas, the PS4 remains bereft of *Katamari* games. Personally, I'd hoped with the ""PS2 Classics"" program, we'd see the original packaged up in Sony's emulator. The program seems to have fizzled out, though, after the initial push. Probably because remastering games and charging sixty bucks is the new hotness. The series creator has expressed interest in doing a remaster, but is presumably still working on the vapoware *Wattam*. The PS3 title, *Katamari Forever*, is available on PlayStation Now, but that is highly dependant on your region and Internet connection — plus you have to pay by the month for the privilege. It remains the only way to spend time rolling things up with the Prince.",,talkingwires,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

It's a pretty simple answer. I finally bought a PS4 Pro last month to round out this gen (I buy them all). While I enjoy the story, in some of their games, the gameplay, with Spider-Man being the sole exception for me just isn't as enjoyable. They're mostly cinematic experiences and that's not why I play games. And I'm not the only person who feels that way. Mostly cinematic experiences lol did you even play any of the games, God of War has 20+ hours of gameplay, Uncharted, Bloodborne, Ratchet & Clank, Infamous, Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn no one considers any of those games ""cinematic experiences"" most of them have some of the best gameplay this gen. Clearly it is you in the minority there friend. >Xbox's games, the controller, Xbox/Xbox 360 backwards compatibility, Game Pass, all make me feel a lot more at home on Xbox, so that's what gets the most play in my home. Great but again you keep missing the point if Game Pass/Xbox games are on all systems what is the point of having the Xbox? The controller and backward compatibility for 360 games? Guarantee that won't matter at all to the majority of gamers, these kind of moves will NOT help the Xbox console brand at all they will just make it easier to justify never buying an Xbox when they can buy the other systems and still play Xbox games. >That's not how XCloud is going to work? If someone has already purchased a game on the platform, why should a publisher have an issue with what screen they're playing it on. Technically, the game on XCloud is still running on Xbox hardware, the video is being streamed to the screen. An Xbox is literally sitting on a rack somewhere running the game, you're not copying it, you're not breaking an agreement, it's no different than having two Xbox Ones and picking up and streaming from that second box to your PC. No that is not how XCloud works at all, do you honestly believe that they will have farms of Xboxes being streamed to people's devices??? It's being streamed via servers much like online games are. And again you have to get the developer to agree to use the service, it's the reason Game Pass isn't every single Xbox game and instead only the ones developers agree to put on there for a limited time. Buying a game on Xbox =/= owning a game you can stream to any device, devs aren't going to allow their games to be on a streaming game service unless they are compensated for it, plain and simple that is how business works. >What happens if Sony elects to go the same route with streaming their games to other devices. They too will have to compete with Google (and Amazon should they go the streaming route). Does that mean no one would buy their next console. Die-hard PlayStation fans would just hang it up and play their games on a PC? I don't see that being the Sony already does that by allowing select PS4 games be on PSNow as well as some other PS3 and older games which works on PC. [PSNow is currently the biggest streaming service out right now making 52% of the market with EA Access at 33% and GP at 15%](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/08/playstation-now-is-more-popular-thank-you-think) but with the way they are selling consoles they have zero intention of letting all their games go on every platform let alone allowing new releases show up on PSNow. Sony much like Nintendo understands that exclusive games drive console sales and while PC gaming has surged the console market is still gigantic in comparison it's where the majority of paid games are bought and systems are still selling crazy good making them lots of money off hardware, software, and services. Now the average consumer is not stupid nor do they show loyalty if one system plays all the same games as another plus more that is the system the majority will flock to it, power does not matter nearly as much as games and price hence why the X is not the best selling system right now.",,outla5t,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The thing is PSNow don't let you buy its service without your credit card or PayPal information even if it's for 1 month through a 15,00 € Gamestop/PSN Voucher. Got an error message three times, tried it on the account of my wife and its the same thing. I don't want to trade my PayPal or credit card information for PSNow when I'm already paying 15 € and can literally buy everything else in the shop with voucher money. Maybe I made a mistake.

And having played a streaming game for a few minutes, it's snappy and plays pretty well. And only PS4 games can be downloaded I think. Quite a few games there that I've been wanting to play for a long while so this is ace for me. E: Also yeah, north Europe especially has really fast internet speeds. The download option is a nice viable safety net, which is why I'm surprised they haven't expanded the service out sooner in general. Streaming games is an absolute diceroll for some parts of the world, but downloading them is generally a pretty safe proposition anywhere.",,Neddy Seagoon,United States of America,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,
