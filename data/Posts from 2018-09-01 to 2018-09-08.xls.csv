The Xbox One is similar architecture to the Xbox 360, just boosted specs. The games that came out on both ps3 and ps4 generally had planned for such all along, so they could account for architecture differences. Mix that with not great code, and the time it would take to get working on ps4 just wasn't viable. PSNOW, basically came about to create a way to emulate games without actually emulating games because it's nearly impossible to do.",,mikegfx,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

You brought up system wars bs with that previous post goddamn, you think any company gives a shit about you? OP haven't we heard this for the last 10 years? Game streaming isn't something that will beat the traditional gaming mediums. Movies are very different from games since it doesn't have to worry about lag, people usually like owning games unlike movies (based on sales) so eh. For real. Projection 101. And I agree. I have not touched PSNow since beta. It was not horrible for me, I just like the traditional full on/optimized experience. I would flirt with it more if they allowed a download option which appears to be in the works, but it would in no way replace traditional gaming for me.

Anyone know what could be causing this? I have tried signing out, re-stating etc and hiding/un-hiding a game to see if that jump started it but nothing. ====================::==================== Yes im having same problem,at first i thought it was just certain PSnow games id streamed not showing ( Which with me not owning those games wouldve been understandable,albeit confusing as some would show up whilst others would not) but ive purchased and played several new games since yesterday and although they register in my trophy list they dont in the actual games list....Its annoying to say the least. However this same issue seems to keep popping up in forums and happening to ps4 owners since at least last year and most of the time seems to ""go right"" for people within a few days,so best advice is to hold tight,make Sony aware maybe? But the faults,i believe, totally on their end and not ours or our ps4's breaking etc...Anyones sorted itself out yet?",,TheAlexandat,Netherlands,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,PSN Profile not showing some games,,,

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm.",,FinalDrive,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm. Click to expand... I kind of tried to explain some of that to him, but he doesn't listen. Maybe he just needs to develop the game and show us all how it's done.",,WoodenSaucer,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,***The PC Games Discussion Thread*** | Page 57,,,

Even wieven With you moving the goal posts PS4 still wins, and consoles still dominate I'm not moving any goal posts? PC can pay more higher rated games than PS4, those goal posts haven't moved in like 30 years?

So onto that list from game rankings. What PS4 lists are playable on PC: Well there you go, out of the top 50 PS4 titles, 40 of them can be played on PC. Vast majority of those playable on PC don't even need emulator or PSNow. Truly a lacklustre console and lineup. *Additional Lol, HZD would be ranked 104th on the PC list, between GTA 4 & The Operative: No One Lives Forever. You have literally and single handedly proven PC is nothing but a multiplat box and that PS4 is the place play if you like AAAE's. That's a better list to prove it then even I could find.",,scatteh316,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Saying ""MS didn't make a good console"" is silly....they made the best one. Currently, PS4 owners can only play their PS3 games on their console with PsNow. That takes in a considerable sum for Sony, and allowing BC would finally bring Sony level with MS, but subscriptions to PSnow would inevitably suffer. I'd say BC is not 100% certain on ps5, especially given the amount of PS4 owners saying they don't care about BC, and nobody uses it. MS will start next gen with full BC, in line with x1, but seeing as Gamepass offers launch titles it won't be affected .... It's already up and running and Sony need to match it with an equivalent. Not saying X2 will outsell ps5, just saying that Sony actually have more challenges ahead than Ms. Xbox has a clear plan; Increase 1st party output (which saw ms buy 6 studios), produce a console capable of playing 4k 60fps at a lower price than Sony, launch first, improve and expand Gamepass, and support BC and Crossplay. Sony have to start supporting BC and Crossplay, introduce a gamepass rival, produce more first party games than Ms, as well as match the other criteria. They also have to decide whether or not to continue to support VR which has hardly set the world on fire. Gamepass and Crossplay haven't moved the needle at all for MS this gen. What makes you think Sony needs to support these features going forward into the next gen? Not saying these features aren't nice to have, they are good but the market has shown they generally do not give a crap. MS are the ones that need to prove a lot going into next gen. I don't know if you noticed but Halo and Gears aren't what they used to be, and those are MS' two biggest IPs. MS bought 6 studios but some of them have already been working on MS games in the past, two of them released flops as a matter of fact. Playground Studios and Ninja Theory are the only guys there with proven hits this gen. The Initiative doesn't have a single game to their name and is just a log at this point. Other than dealing with having to revitalize stagnant IPs like Halo and Gears, MS also has to establish new IPs going forward and none of their new IPs this gen have been successful which is almost the complete opposite for Sony who seem to have the Midas touch this gen. MS has to not only fix their fist party games problem which is a tall order in itself they have to also regain customer confidence that they lost in markets like Europe. They're doing well in the US to regain their footing but they've totally lost Europe to Sony and in Asia they might as well not exist. MS have a shut ton to prove next gen and it's not something that releasing new hardware or services can fix. They need games and tons of high quality games if they want to compete with Sony on a worldwide stage. Forgive me, but which New IP's have been successfull for Sony this gen? i get Horizon Zero dawn was but what others. dont forget that Sony just dropped Ready at Dawn and closed evolution, NMS was a full on disaster too. Titanfall 1 was a success on x1. the second titanfall was a crappier MP game but with a good single player. Sea of thieves has been popular, PUBG and plenty of others have done well on xbox, you seem to have sony tinted glasses on dude.",,sts106mat,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,,,,,,,,

Agreed. Probably because they came too late...But we're talking about next gen, and while MS have those in place already, Sony has only psnow in place. Would Sony fans really be ok with a ps5 that didn't offer BC and Crossplay if X2 did? What would be the justification? What happens to PSnow if they do offer BC? Diehard fans will buy their preferred consoles regardless of content, hardware or even price. The majority of customers are looking for the best deal...at $100 cheaper, with more powerful hardware and a clearer message, that was PS4 for the majority this gen. However, if ms pull off an earlier launch, with all those features intact...next gen will be close. Those studios that released for ms in the past were independents. Now, with the finances offered by ms, they're hiring more Devs and aiming higher.

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm.",,FinalDrive,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,***The PC Games Discussion Thread*** | Page 57,,,

They simply don't/ won't invest the capital. You don't need to have the biggest server network to have adequate service, especially if server leasing isn't part of your business. Also, having the biggest server farms does not get you around the speed of light and electricity, so you'll still have latency, regardless of the size. Not the biggest, but you still need to have a global infrastructure in place to meet demand. What Sony have now simply doesn't cut it (which is a bit worrying as I imagine their current subscriber base is pitiful)*, and they'll never compete with the likes of AWS or Azure. And I never suggested the speed of light and electricity, so no idea where that notion came from. Theres a reason we aren't streaming games via Gamepass right now, because we would run into the same problems PSNow has (albeit not to such an extreme). When MS launch this ""XCloud"" service in future, I can guarantee it'll perform better than PSNow. *My own guesstimate LOL Sony is not competing with Azure so why should they? Their system works even with connections as low as 5MB,you don't have them because it was sony who went first and if MS goes there it has to watch out what tech it use to stream,as sony own patents which were held by both Onlive and Gaikai sony bought those busyness for a reason.",,tormentos,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

If it's streaming locally over your home network, which I think it does, then you don't even need internet to do it. It uses internet. If your connection is solid, it’ll be virtually lag free. You can even play with a DualShock 3 or 4 that way if you desire to. Likely even the Steam controller, though I don’t have one to test it. If your connection is less than stellar, though, you’ll be looking at an experience closer to that of PSNow on a poor connection... Through the Xbox app on Windows 10? Home network works.

MS said no last gen when they were leading in consoles sales. No that PS4 has completely dropped kicked them this gen they should just bend the knee and play nice?.. I buy my consoles to play games and this gen Sony has been delivery quality experiences and been on an insanely great run with exclusive the last 2-3 years. While Xbox has put their efforts elsewhere with the looks of gearing up in a big way for next gen. It's always in the best efforts for the companies with mi ority market share to be more consumer friendly. It has it's perks. Gamepass is an amazing model and has shown playstation what PSnow should have been. They bought 5 studios one of which just game off a Sony exclusive. Amazing effort with BC. One upped Sonys pro with their X model. Sony isn't perfect don't get me wrong. From the sound of things they have a pretty bad customer service chat or phone thankfully I have yet to deal with them. Some really loud consoles. Some anti consumer practices (refunds on PSN being harder to get than a playmates number. I personally don't care about that one but it's big enough an issue for many that I have to acknowledge it. .) Swinging their Ban Hammer like Thor after a few red bulls. No psn name change. Having a hardly used and yet to be used in a fun way (for) touch pad in their controller that probably drains a lot of battery just being there. Pretty average to bad store layout and navigation. No bluetooth headphone capabilities. But again while I did own a X1 for a bit (for Sunset Overdrive), own a switch and have a ps4 and just upgraded to a pro. I'll say without a doubt if a friend asked which console should I buy I'd say Sony. If they asked why I'd rattle off that in my opinion the difference between the X and pro isn't too then show them the dozens of great exclusives on the console. As well many more that are in the pipeline. Also VR.",,DenverVikingsFan91,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I’m fine with waiting a few months for exclusives to become multiplat. Irrelevant comparison anyway. You’re reaching to defend a practice that only burdens the consumer. Moving goal posts and changing the argument away from hardware because you can’t counter my claim. No matter how you look at it, I don’t need Netflix to watch the shows you listed. You seem very passionate about exclusives and having less choice so I’ll agree to disagree with your opinion. And you act like there is no benefits for exclusivity... You think Sony or Nintendo would put the same amount of money or effort if there was no exclusives? They won't be ause they won't have to because they won't have to sell the hardware to need to. I believe with the added revenue from thier IPs being purchased by three times as many people would be a benefit. You don't think Sony payed them for the exclusivity?

I ended up getting a used one on ebay for 107.50 and 7.15 shipping. The seller listed it as barely used less than 80 hours. and he listed a picture and I couldn't see any inperfections on the screen. And he had a good seller rating. I kept getting out bid at the last moment the last few days on the different vitas I tried to get and I made sure I got this one. I hope I didn't get a lemon... Ok so what else should I be picking up? I need a sd card. Should I look into getting a sd2vita card? Where can I look to get a decent deal on a sony micro sd vita card. Where do you guys find your physical games? Are they getting expensive? Should I look into getting playstation now or playstation plus thingy? What case should get? I travel a lot and I carry a backpack with me and I'd like to put it in there without worry that it will get damaged. This doesn't come with a charger but I'm assuming micousb will charge this just fine. Am I wrong to assume that? Also is this system fast charging? Should I look into getting a new battery? And ZOMG the games!!! Recommend me some games guys. I like platformers 2d and 3d, Japanese rpgs, castleroid/metroidvanias, rogue and rogue lite, shooters and strategy games. The one game I know I want to play is gravity Rush. I'm going to comment on physical games and basically to summarize, don't even bother with a lot of them if trying to get Brand New sealed copies. Outside of a very select few in plentiful supply which should be easy to find at very reasonable prices, a vast majority just don't fall into this same category especially with a huge chunk of LRG titles. Since you don't mind getting used electronics I'd say go for the same mentality regarding physical games if that's your thing. Prices are a lot more competitively in your favor if you look hard enough on eBay (avoid Amazon tbh). GameStop can be hit or miss. Really depends on your area.",,tw1g_007,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

They simply don't/ won't invest the capital. You don't need to have the biggest server network to have adequate service, especially if server leasing isn't part of your business. Also, having the biggest server farms does not get you around the speed of light and electricity, so you'll still have latency, regardless of the size. Not the biggest, but you still need to have a global infrastructure in place to meet demand. What Sony have now simply doesn't cut it (which is a bit worrying as I imagine their current subscriber base is pitiful)*, and they'll never compete with the likes of AWS or Azure. And I never suggested the speed of light and electricity, so no idea where that notion came from. Theres a reason we aren't streaming games via Gamepass right now, because we would run into the same problems PSNow has (albeit not to such an extreme). When MS launch this ""XCloud"" service in future, I can guarantee it'll perform better than PSNow. *My own guesstimate LOL The speeds of light and electricity come into play as the distance that your controller input and the resultant video have to travel causes lag that more servers will not diminish. Then there's also encoding time for the video, which Sony uses a specialized chip to speed up, but is not a typical part of server design. More servers will not completely diminish lag, but it will certainly help. Being one of the largest networks in the world with more locations than any other provider will only strengthen any streaming service that Xbox come out with. Like i said earlier, theres a reason we don't stream games via Gamepass at present. It would be shit like PSNow. What MS have planned for game streaming a few years down the line sounds a lot more feasible, with local compute handling certain tasks that will reduce input lag etc. I don't expect it to be perfect, but I do expect it to be a lot better than what we have now.",,RR360DD,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm.",,FinalDrive,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,***The PC Games Discussion Thread*** | Page 57,,,

Vast majority of those playable on PC don't even need emulator or PSNow.

Also, having the biggest server farms does not get you around the speed of light and electricity, so you'll still have latency, regardless of the size. Not the biggest, but you still need to have a global infrastructure in place to meet demand. What Sony have now simply doesn't cut it (which is a bit worrying as I imagine their current subscriber base is pitiful)*, and they'll never compete with the likes of AWS or Azure. And I never suggested the speed of light and electricity, so no idea where that notion came from.

Steam natively supports the DS4 and I have mine hooked up via a generic bluetooth dongle. It is not using x-input emulation because the touchpad and gyro features work perfectly fine using it this way for Steam or games running through Steam. Just run a PC game through Steam and it'll work. PSNow I use a wired connection because the input lag is so bad otherwise and always have. I've heard this is an issue even with the official dongle. It's worse in some games than others, but even when it's at its best there's still a delay using wireless that isn't there when wired. I did test it out with Bloodborne, and yes, you do need a wired connection for the touchpad to work on PC. Pretty much a non issue in my case as I always play that way anyway. However, none of these things is a problem when playing using a DS4 using Steam. The controller works great with no noticeable lag wireless with a standard Bluetooth dongle, and the touchpad and motion controls work fine. Running PSNow through Steam doesn't fix the issues. It makes the lag worse and doesn't enable the touchpad. It seems as though Sony deliberately disabled features so you'd have to buy their dongle [which they don't make anymore]. Not surprising, if a bit dickish. They could easily make a driver for PC where a standard Bluetooth dongle would allow all of the features of the controller to work properly. Steam does exactly that with no problems at all. Maybe they'll magically conjure up support for that in the future, though I'm not sure it will matter in my case anyway considering the input lag issue.",,contrabardus,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I didn't exclude anything, I even provided the name of every game that's AAAE and the year of release to make it easy for butt hurt fan boys. Yeah, you said not to use anything that wasn't from 2013 onward and only on the PC list of Metacritic.

So I have wait it out until it's available on another source... Well guess what you'll just have to wait it out until it will be on another source as well. Probably psnow years later or the PlayStation version of game pass. Both discs were not available during the release of either shows on their respective streaming sites. I’m fine with waiting a few months for exclusives to become multiplat. Irrelevant comparison anyway. You’re reaching to defend a practice that only burdens the consumer. Moving goal posts and changing the argument away from hardware because you can’t counter my claim. No matter how you look at it, I don’t need Netflix to watch the shows you listed. You seem very passionate about exclusives and having less choice so I’ll agree to disagree with your opinion. And you act like there is no benefits for exclusivity... You think Sony or Nintendo would put the same amount of money or effort if there was no exclusives? They won't be ause they won't have to because they won't have to sell the hardware to need to.",,ejay8320,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Not too mention the ridiculous pricing for PSnow. In my opinion gaming is in the same spot as movies where before Netflix, you could watch movies as much as you wanted as long as certain conditions where met. A) you own a dvd or vhs player B) you have physical access to the necessary equipment required to play said movie C) last but not least you have to purchase the movie first Same can be said about gaming today A) you own a Xbox or PS4 B) you have physical access to gaming console C) last but not least you have to purchase the game first I am going to say this just one more time and that is it In 2008, we would set time aside to watch The Wire when it came on, when HBO time slot for it to show. The appeal, the amazement, the excitement, we even talked about it with excitement, was the fact that we could watch something like The Wire anytime we want without even thinking much about it....cost NEVER was the point. Yes...before Netflix there was ways around it, sure you could buy the series and put in on your shelf, yes you could use a DVR all true, but the convenience of plopping on the couch anytime you want to watch a movie was very appealing, more so then cost. Games are different in that you do not play a game for 2 hours at a time and then move on to the next one. The games you buy are several hours of game play. There was NEVER ever in the history of gaming, ever the problem of 'I have to be home at 8pm because that is when The Wire starts' If 'Netflix of gaming' was going to be such a massive huge tidial wave change then it Sonys version would have gotten a lot more action then they have. I am not explaining my prediction again, I am not changing my mind on this. My prediction might end up false but its my prediction and the reasons for it have been illustrated mulitple times and I am not changing my mind...peroid.",,TryIt,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

To me that shows that the PC audience isn't cannibalizing console sales as much as people expected. Ofc Sony is in a position where they dont need to do anything. They are the most successful and can keep doing what they are doing this gen since they are on top. But next gen is approaching in about 2 years.

If you have a wired 360 controller or wireless dongle for your 360 controller you can stream your XB1 to your PC and use your 360 controller that way I've done it myself, but I have fairly decent internet, obviously streaming isn't an option for everyone Does it stream through the internet or just directly over your lan? If it's streaming locally over your home network, which I think it does, then you don't even need internet to do it. It uses internet. If your connection is solid, it’ll be virtually lag free. You can even play with a DualShock 3 or 4 that way if you desire to. Likely even the Steam controller, though I don’t have one to test it.

This is ongoing, active service that can be improved and evolve. How is MS's non-existent cloud gaming? Nvidia's out of Beta yet? No? To say Sony lost before most competitors have even started is rather absurd. It works OK...sure if you're fine with notable input lag and games lagging. They had their chance to show that they can make it work well and they failed, as of right now PSNow is complete garbage. It is an ongoing service that can be improved and evolved but given Sony's track record of improving and evolving anything you'll have to wait until 20 years before it becomes a feasible service. MS/Nvidia/Amazon/Google may not have a cloud streaming service yet but when they do (sooner rather than later) have theirs they're all going to work significantly better than Sony's streaming abortion. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2017-playstation-nows-ps4-game-performance-analysed Eurogamer said, last year, that the service works fine and that you adjust to the input lag in time. You think this haven't been updated and polished since then? You think they're sitting idle doing nothing?

That excluded 92 other games from the PC list and all other games the PC can play via PSNow etc. etc. S the only way you can beat PS4 is by adding variables to give PC an advantage.

I've already explained that my numbers are off Metacritic, go a head and check my numbers for yourself, you'll find my numbers are 100% accurate. 2. I never said games on STEAM have issues.... although 1 game also did when I gamed on PC....wonder if they ever fixed it?? 3. A small example of games not working is still games that don't work and some of these games could be in your list..... that is just a fact. 4. x86 emulation is hit and miss, which is why some people dual boot OS's - While you're checking my data at Metacritic may I suggest you do some research on old games that don't work on Windows 10. 5. ""Most old"" - key word there....""most""......most is not all. 6. I've not set up any artificial barriers against any platform, people just think I have because they don't like my findings and it upsets them. On metacritic, since PS4 released in 2013 it has more games with a score of 90+ then PC and more exclusive games with a score of 90+ then PC. PC has more games with a score of 8 to 8.9 then PS4. That is what I have always claimed and that is what the data on metacritic shows and if you don't like it then that is your problem. 1. Righto, I'll do a top 50 of the PS4 games playable on PC from Metacritic too. Will that make you feel better. 2 - 3. So how many PS4 games shall I exclude because I can find a few that don't work on all PS4's? I'm thinking about 8 out of that top 50 ought to do it :D 4. This is suuuuuch a non-issue. If you think there are big time problems with the PC library how about you list me a few games so I can refute it instead of us just bantering. 5. Yeah, most. Like how most old games are not available on PS4. 6. The date range was a barrier to entry created by yourself in this argument. Others try and exclude entire genre's on PC, only count exclusives, dismiss increased performance. You name it. You might not be guilty of all of them, but they are in pretty much every PC vs anything thread. I will have a have a look at Metacritic and get back with a list to verify your metacritic claim. Your claim: ""On metacritic, since PS4 released in 2013 it has more games with a score of 90+ then PC and more exclusive games with a score of 90+ then PC."" The results. PS4 List (with ranks): http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/ps4/filtered 1. GTA V (97) (PC) 2. The Last of Us Remastered (95) (PSNow, uncertain if remastered version, likely not) 3. God of War (94) 4. Persona 5 (93) (PC Via Emu) 5. Metal Gear Solid V (93) (PC) 6. Uncharted 4 (93) 7. Divinity Original Sin 2 - DE (92) (PC) 8. Journey (92) (PC via PSNow) 9. Bloodbourne (92) 10. Undertale (92) (PC) 11. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (92) (PC) 12. Shadow of the Colossus (91) (PC via PSNow) 13. The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine (91) (PC) 14. Celeste (91) (PC) 15. Inside (91) (PC) 16. Flower (91) (PC via PSNow) 17. Diablo 3: Ultimate Evil Edition (90) (PC) 18. Overwatch (90) (PC) 19. Shovel Knight (90) (PC) 20. Rayman Legends (90) (PC) 21. Fez (90) (PC) 22. Monster Hunter World (90) (PC) 23. Tales from the Borderlands: Episode 5 (90) (PC) 24. The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone (90) (PC) PS4 - Total 24 games rated 90 or higher. Of those games 20 playable on PC (uncertain of Last of Us Remastered). PC List (2013 onwards only): I'm just going to list there rank on metacritic so I can track easier. http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/pc/filtered 2. GTA V (96), 2015 13. Bioshock Infinite (94), 2013 18. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (93), 2015 20. Divinity: Original Sin 2 (93), 2017 38. Okami HD (92), 2017 39. Undertale (92), 2015 45. Out of the park Baseball 17 (92), 2016 (PC Exclusive) 46. The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine (92), 2016 52. Overwatch (91), 2016 57. Metal Gear Solid V (91), 2015 59. Kentucky Route Zero - Act 3 (91), 2014 73. Fez (91), 2013 79. Dark Souls 2 (91), 2014 85. Spelunky (90), 2013) 86. Stephen's Sausage Roll (90), 2016 (PC Exclusive) 97. Bayonetta (90), 2017 103. Dota 2 (90), 2013 (PC Exclusive) 110. Kentucky Route Zero - Act 4 (90), 2016 PC - Total 18 games rated 90 or higher. So I will say this. Strictly speaking to your claim, ""On metacritic, since PS4 released in 2013 it has more games with a score of 90+ then PC and more exclusive games with a score of 90+ then PC."" I have to say you are correct. However, only 4 (3 maybe) of the PS4 games in that list are not available on PC to play, yet. As to the exclusives claim. PS4 has 4(Last of Us is up in the air whether it is exclusive or not. ie. PS3) exclusive games 90 or higher. PC has 3 that I can identify rated 90 or higher. So strictly speaking, according to metacritic you are correct. PS4 has (probably) 1 more exclusive 90 or higher rated game than PC. I will say this though, all you had to do to get these figures was exclude, 92 PC games rated 90 or higher to get these results. Was just thinking on this. The PC list I entered did not contain games from other consoles released from 2013 onward that scored 90 or higher that are playable on the PC. I'm guessing everyone can do the math on that one.",,Jereb31,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Emulating the Cell architecture has been a tremendous pain in the ass, and Sony would much rather put effort into the PS1 and PS2 backwards compatible titles on their store than waste even more money on the PS3. Crazy Ken set Sony and the industry back a decade in terms of product ramp. Console lifecycles were much shorter prior to the PS3 launch. But ignoring PS3 backwards compatibility, that's not really up to them, because PlayStation Now hasn't really taken off either. All that they would need to do is hire the RPCS3 development team to figure out the emulation for them, because they have been making incredible progress. I wager they'll have this working on the PS5 because they'll have heaps more CPU power available to run the emulators.",,CataclysmZA,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

PlayStation Now has shown to have a pretty significant delay for games.

When TTK 2.0 came around, it became more difficult to play as an ""objective Scout"" but I think it was still certainly possible. I played the heck out of every class in that game but it was definitely my favorite way to play. With this s***ty damage model it feels like the game has regressed to Battlefield 4. I just hope there aren't any big old towers out in the middle of nowhere to parachute onto in this game because you know people with nothing better to do will do the exact same thing they used to do in BF4/BF3. Really did think DICE had learned their lesson on this. In BF1 it was a lot less of the old game of Scouts pretty much only being countered by other Scouts or sneaking up on them. I regularly killed Scouts with semi-automatic rifles or LMGs in BF1. Certainly seemed like they were more part of the fight and not always just this off to the side thing. Not a fan of BF4 and that's what this feels more similar to. I hope DICE reconsiders this damage model but I doubt that a major change will occur before release. http://i.imgur.com/CDLoa.jpg ""I want to send you hatemail just from looking at your stats."" -TrgaDaBest ====================::==================== User Info: VaughnMaul VaughnMaul 2 days ago #10 josifrees posted...

You are the definition of a corporate slave. Thirdly, Crossley has only upsides no downsides at all.

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm.",,FinalDrive,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,***The PC Games Discussion Thread*** | Page 57,,,

Stop stretching reality because your analogies failed and your can't accept the FACT that you DO NOT NEED a PS4 to play Bloodborne. Take your issues up with Sony and learn to form more concrete arguments in the future instead of beating around the bush with nonsensical counter arguments. What goes on at Sony's end isn't my business. All I need is a Windows PC, a controller, ISP and PSNow account to play the games. Its stuff like this that is really fanatical. Cow just need to believe their hiney's are special and different than everyone else's Not meaning to have a go at you, but on the other hand, you did express this point of view in the Bloodborne thread regarding PSNow. @cainetao11 said: @quadknight said: @Juub1990 said: Bloodborne’s frame pacing is hot garbage and they’re adding latency into the mix? Oh boy. Yup, good luck to the poor saps that will try streaming it. Seriously people, a used PS4 is cheap as hell! Get one now from your local pawn shop or Gamestop. No need to torture yourself streaming this game! Couldn't agree more. I was gifted 3 months of PSNow in summer 2016. was better than I anticipated but still not worth $15/month. The latency can be a problem, but I can handle the resolution considering. Just get a used vanilla PS4. Its like the second best console ever after PS2 imo. That kind of backs up just one of the things I was pointing out a couple of posts above yours. Not being fanatical or anything, it's my honest point of view on this at the moment. I don't know what the future holds many years from now though. With improved technology including improved internet in all areas of the world, you never know how good these kinds of services could become. Possibly just about anything playable on anything with no real problems, and with much better deals? Or maybe not. Don't know. Anyway, whatever you want to label these kinds of games, they're not 'multiplat' in the same way we would traditionally consider a game a multiplat release. Not exactly exclusive in the same way either. As in, the only gaming system where you can buy the game and play it locally on that system is the PS4, but you can also subscribe to PSNow to stream it to your PC until your subscription runs out.",,tubbyc,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

What I will happily admit though is that I have an Xbox game pass subscription but I do not have a psnow subscription. Because they just do not compare at all. If the download rumour is true then that's possibly a game changer for me and I'll look at psnow more. But as a streaming service it just suffers too much from input lag :-( You are pretty much like me except I tend to favour the Xbox for multi platform games and only use my pro for its exclusives, a game pass type service is the way forward.

They simply don't/ won't invest the capital. You don't need to have the biggest server network to have adequate service, especially if server leasing isn't part of your business. Also, having the biggest server farms does not get you around the speed of light and electricity, so you'll still have latency, regardless of the size. Not the biggest, but you still need to have a global infrastructure in place to meet demand. What Sony have now simply doesn't cut it (which is a bit worrying as I imagine their current subscriber base is pitiful)*, and they'll never compete with the likes of AWS or Azure. And I never suggested the speed of light and electricity, so no idea where that notion came from. Theres a reason we aren't streaming games via Gamepass right now, because we would run into the same problems PSNow has (albeit not to such an extreme). When MS launch this ""XCloud"" service in future, I can guarantee it'll perform better than PSNow. *My own guesstimate LOL The speeds of light and electricity come into play as the distance that your controller input and the resultant video have to travel causes lag that more servers will not diminish. Then there's also encoding time for the video, which Sony uses a specialized chip to speed up, but is not a typical part of server design. More servers will not completely diminish lag, but it will certainly help. Being one of the largest networks in the world with more locations than any other provider will only strengthen any streaming service that Xbox come out with. Like i said earlier, theres a reason we don't stream games via Gamepass at present. It would be shit like PSNow. What MS have planned for game streaming a few years down the line sounds a lot more feasible, with local compute handling certain tasks that will reduce input lag etc. I don't expect it to be perfect, but I do expect it to be a lot better than what we have now. Ah, yes, Microsoft's half-assed approach. They're combining the lag of remote rendering with local installation and higher hardware requirements. There's several issues with this. Just doing physics on remote objects is fine, until you want to interact with them, then the laugh could cause issues. Doing collision detection locally means that the local computer will have to maintain at least the wireframe of everything, but then the server will be drawing incorrect frames and reconciling them after interactions causing animation inconsistencies and other artifacts.",,asylumni,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

If you are unsure that you have the connection to stream the games, there is a free 7 day trial. The introductory pricing of the streaming service is $9.99 a month, $29.99 for 3 months of service, or $99.99 for a solid year of the subscription service. Although note that in order to take advantage of the $9.99 intro offer, you will need to purchase that directly, as the 7-day trial will transition into the standard monthly subscription. ====================::==================== I hated Bloodborne because I sucked at it.

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm.

Maybe he just needs to develop the game and show us all how it's done.",,WoodenSaucer,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I've already explained that my numbers are off Metacritic, go a head and check my numbers for yourself, you'll find my numbers are 100% accurate. 2. I never said games on STEAM have issues.... although 1 game also did when I gamed on PC....wonder if they ever fixed it?? 3. A small example of games not working is still games that don't work and some of these games could be in your list..... that is just a fact. 4. x86 emulation is hit and miss, which is why some people dual boot OS's - While you're checking my data at Metacritic may I suggest you do some research on old games that don't work on Windows 10. 5. ""Most old"" - key word there....""most""......most is not all. 6. I've not set up any artificial barriers against any platform, people just think I have because they don't like my findings and it upsets them. On metacritic, since PS4 released in 2013 it has more games with a score of 90+ then PC and more exclusive games with a score of 90+ then PC. PC has more games with a score of 8 to 8.9 then PS4. That is what I have always claimed and that is what the data on metacritic shows and if you don't like it then that is your problem. 1. Righto, I'll do a top 50 of the PS4 games playable on PC from Metacritic too. Will that make you feel better. 2 - 3. So how many PS4 games shall I exclude because I can find a few that don't work on all PS4's? I'm thinking about 8 out of that top 50 ought to do it :D 4. This is suuuuuch a non-issue. If you think there are big time problems with the PC library how about you list me a few games so I can refute it instead of us just bantering. 5. Yeah, most. Like how most old games are not available on PS4. 6. The date range was a barrier to entry created by yourself in this argument. Others try and exclude entire genre's on PC, only count exclusives, dismiss increased performance. You name it. You might not be guilty of all of them, but they are in pretty much every PC vs anything thread. I will have a have a look at Metacritic and get back with a list to verify your metacritic claim. Your claim: ""On metacritic, since PS4 released in 2013 it has more games with a score of 90+ then PC and more exclusive games with a score of 90+ then PC."" The results. PS4 List (with ranks): http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/ps4/filtered 1. GTA V (97) (PC) 2. The Last of Us Remastered (95) (PSNow, uncertain if remastered version, likely not) 3. God of War (94) 4. Persona 5 (93) (PC Via Emu) 5. Metal Gear Solid V (93) (PC) 6. Uncharted 4 (93) 7.

Tales from the Borderlands: Episode 5 (90) (PC) 24. The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone (90) (PC) PS4 - Total 24 games rated 90 or higher. Of those games 20 playable on PC (uncertain of Last of Us Remastered). PC List (2013 onwards only): I'm just going to list there rank on metacritic so I can track easier. http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/pc/filtered 2. GTA V (96), 2015 13. Bioshock Infinite (94), 2013 18. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (93), 2015 20. Divinity: Original Sin 2 (93), 2017 38. Okami HD (92), 2017 39. Undertale (92), 2015 45. Out of the park Baseball 17 (92), 2016 (PC Exclusive) 46. The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine (92), 2016 52. Overwatch (91), 2016 57. Metal Gear Solid V (91), 2015 59. Kentucky Route Zero - Act 3 (91), 2014 73. Fez (91), 2013 79. Dark Souls 2 (91), 2014 85. Spelunky (90), 2013) 86. Stephen's Sausage Roll (90), 2016 (PC Exclusive) 97. Bayonetta (90), 2017 103. Dota 2 (90), 2013 (PC Exclusive) 110. Kentucky Route Zero - Act 4 (90), 2016 PC - Total 18 games rated 90 or higher. So I will say this. Strictly speaking to your claim, ""On metacritic, since PS4 released in 2013 it has more games with a score of 90+ then PC and more exclusive games with a score of 90+ then PC."" I have to say you are correct. However, only 4 (3 maybe) of the PS4 games in that list are not available on PC to play, yet. As to the exclusives claim. PS4 has 4(Last of Us is up in the air whether it is exclusive or not. ie. PS3) exclusive games 90 or higher. PC has 3 that I can identify rated 90 or higher. So strictly speaking, according to metacritic you are correct. PS4 has (probably) 1 more exclusive 90 or higher rated game than PC. I will say this though, all you had to do to get these figures was exclude, 92 PC games rated 90 or higher to get these results.",,Jereb31,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Saying ""MS didn't make a good console"" is silly....they made the best one. Currently, PS4 owners can only play their PS3 games on their console with PsNow. That takes in a considerable sum for Sony, and allowing BC would finally bring Sony level with MS, but subscriptions to PSnow would inevitably suffer. I'd say BC is not 100% certain on ps5, especially given the amount of PS4 owners saying they don't care about BC, and nobody uses it. MS will start next gen with full BC, in line with x1, but seeing as Gamepass offers launch titles it won't be affected .... It's already up and running and Sony need to match it with an equivalent. Not saying X2 will outsell ps5, just saying that Sony actually have more challenges ahead than Ms. Xbox has a clear plan; Increase 1st party output (which saw ms buy 6 studios), produce a console capable of playing 4k 60fps at a lower price than Sony, launch first, improve and expand Gamepass, and support BC and Crossplay. Sony have to start supporting BC and Crossplay, introduce a gamepass rival, produce more first party games than Ms, as well as match the other criteria. They also have to decide whether or not to continue to support VR which has hardly set the world on fire. Gamepass and Crossplay haven't moved the needle at all for MS this gen. What makes you think Sony needs to support these features going forward into the next gen? Not saying these features aren't nice to have, they are good but the market has shown they generally do not give a crap. MS are the ones that need to prove a lot going into next gen. I don't know if you noticed but Halo and Gears aren't what they used to be, and those are MS' two biggest IPs. MS bought 6 studios but some of them have already been working on MS games in the past, two of them released flops as a matter of fact. Playground Studios and Ninja Theory are the only guys there with proven hits this gen. The Initiative doesn't have a single game to their name and is just a log at this point. Other than dealing with having to revitalize stagnant IPs like Halo and Gears, MS also has to establish new IPs going forward and none of their new IPs this gen have been successful which is almost the complete opposite for Sony who seem to have the Midas touch this gen. MS has to not only fix their fist party games problem which is a tall order in itself they have to also regain customer confidence that they lost in markets like Europe. They're doing well in the US to regain their footing but they've totally lost Europe to Sony and in Asia they might as well not exist. MS have a shut ton to prove next gen and it's not something that releasing new hardware or services can fix. They need games and tons of high quality games if they want to compete with Sony on a worldwide stage. Forgive me, but which New IP's have been successfull for Sony this gen? i get Horizon Zero dawn was but what others. dont forget that Sony just dropped Ready at Dawn and closed evolution, NMS was a full on disaster too. Titanfall 1 was a success, the second one was a crappier MP game but with a good single player. Sea of thieves has been popular, PUBG and plenty of others have done well on xbox, you seem to have sony tinted glasses on dude. Spiderman and Bloodborne. Sea of Thieves isn't popular. It was popular the month it dropped and fell off the charts. PUBG is dying and doesn't even have a majority of its population on Xbox. The Xbox launch of PUBG has generally been a disaster since the port has been shitty. I don't have rose tinted Sony glasses, I'm seeing things clearly my friend. So two games, one of which isn't even out yet? Bloodborne scored well but successful IP? i thought its sales were pretty good but not stellar, no sign of a sequel either. xbox also has seen success with indie games like cuphead, Ori etc etc. so we have determined that of the new IPs, both consoles are about the same then. Sea of thieves is popular from what i've heard. it dropping off of the chart is likely due to it being on game pass. Xbox exclusives wont sell as well now because gamepass is such good value. I just got two months of game pass for only £2.00, thats awesome. I am using gamepass for Forza horizon, since i get bored of driving games sometimes within a couple of days, why would i spend £50 on it when i can play if for a lot cheaper?",,sts106mat,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,,,,,,,,

I have a Surface Pro 3 and it is great. My family and I don't buy is***. We haven't owned a single apple product since a black and white apple mac many years ago. Windows and Android are much better when you factor everything in. I have a surface pro 3 and it's s***. The thermal design is inadequate, the Surface Pen 3 requires more pressure than you can safely apply to the screen without damaging it, and there's a myriad of software and driver issues with it. Apparently, Pro 3 was a real lemon, though, and the bottom of the Surface Pro barrel. Having used it professionally for over 2 years, I was happy for the first year and a half and then it started to fall apart because it wasn't made to actually be used for more than a year. The thermal design could be a little better I guess, you hear the fan crank up a good amount, but what do you expect, it in many respects pushes a full on PC in a tablet. I also am still able to leave it in Urban Armor without any real problems. I've had mine for about 3 years now without any major problems, I think I reinstalled Windows 10 once. I upgraded to Windows 10 on it almost right away though, so I'm not completely sure how 7 and 8 run on it. I did use the pen for awhile, but not on any super intensive tasks. I think it was like a year in though I switched over almost completely to a mouse along with the type cover. I like how I can pretty much use it just fine with a mouse and keyboard on just a folding table. I play some games on it with little problems and also run PSNow on it with almost no problems. I'm actually typing this message on it right now. I use it for personal use and not professional though, which I guess could matter, but I don't see it mattering to the point of where it is complete s***. I don't mind the fan cranking up, I mind the CPU going over 90c regularly and the poor ventilation causing dust buildup with no good way of cleaning it. In fact, the heatsink fins wind up actually hurting thermal performance in the long run. Bad bad bad. Also, the pen thing is kind of a big deal, seeing as that's a selling point of the tablet.",,DarkZV2Beta,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm. Click to expand... I kind of tried to explain some of that to him, but he doesn't listen. Maybe he just needs to develop the game and show us all how it's done.",,WoodenSaucer,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,***The PC Games Discussion Thread*** | Page 57,,,

They simply don't/ won't invest the capital. You don't need to have the biggest server network to have adequate service, especially if server leasing isn't part of your business. Also, having the biggest server farms does not get you around the speed of light and electricity, so you'll still have latency, regardless of the size. Not the biggest, but you still need to have a global infrastructure in place to meet demand. What Sony have now simply doesn't cut it (which is a bit worrying as I imagine their current subscriber base is pitiful)*, and they'll never compete with the likes of AWS or Azure. And I never suggested the speed of light and electricity, so no idea where that notion came from. Theres a reason we aren't streaming games via Gamepass right now, because we would run into the same problems PSNow has (albeit not to such an extreme). When MS launch this ""XCloud"" service in future, I can guarantee it'll perform better than PSNow. *My own guesstimate LOL The speeds of light and electricity come into play as the distance that your controller input and the resultant video have to travel causes lag that more servers will not diminish. Then there's also encoding time for the video, which Sony uses a specialized chip to speed up, but is not a typical part of server design.",,asylumni,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm.

PlayStation Now is a video game streaming service from Sony that allows PC and PS4 gamers to play over 650 PS4, PS3, and PS2 games. If you are unsure that you have the connection to stream the games, there is a free 7 day trial. The introductory pricing of the streaming service is $9.99 a month, $29.99 for 3 months of service, or $99.99 for a solid year of the subscription service. Although note that in order to take advantage of the $9.99 intro offer, you will need to purchase that directly, as the 7-day trial will transition into the standard monthly subscription. ====================::==================== djoye said: ↑ I just wish they would fix the frame pacing, for the love of Beavis.

Saying ""MS didn't make a good console"" is silly....they made the best one. Currently, PS4 owners can only play their PS3 games on their console with PsNow. That takes in a considerable sum for Sony, and allowing BC would finally bring Sony level with MS, but subscriptions to PSnow would inevitably suffer. I'd say BC is not 100% certain on ps5, especially given the amount of PS4 owners saying they don't care about BC, and nobody uses it. MS will start next gen with full BC, in line with x1, but seeing as Gamepass offers launch titles it won't be affected .... It's already up and running and Sony need to match it with an equivalent. Not saying X2 will outsell ps5, just saying that Sony actually have more challenges ahead than Ms. Xbox has a clear plan; Increase 1st party output (which saw ms buy 6 studios), produce a console capable of playing 4k 60fps at a lower price than Sony, launch first, improve and expand Gamepass, and support BC and Crossplay. Sony have to start supporting BC and Crossplay, introduce a gamepass rival, produce more first party games than Ms, as well as match the other criteria. They also have to decide whether or not to continue to support VR which has hardly set the world on fire. Gamepass and Crossplay haven't moved the needle at all for MS this gen. What makes you think Sony needs to support these features going forward into the next gen? Not saying these features aren't nice to have, they are good but the market has shown they generally do not give a crap. MS are the ones that need to prove a lot going into next gen. I don't know if you noticed but Halo and Gears aren't what they used to be, and those are MS' two biggest IPs. MS bought 6 studios but some of them have already been working on MS games in the past, two of them released flops as a matter of fact. Playground Studios and Ninja Theory are the only guys there with proven hits this gen. The Initiative doesn't have a single game to their name and is just a logo at this point. Other than dealing with having to revitalize stagnant IPs like Halo and Gears, MS also has to establish new IPs going forward, and none of their new IPs this gen have been successful which is almost the complete opposite for Sony who seem to have the Midas touch this gen. MS has to not only fix their first party games problem which is a tall order in itself, they have to also regain customer confidence that they lost in markets in Europe. They're doing well in the US to regain their footing but they've totally lost Europe to Sony and in Asia they might as well not exist. MS have a shit ton to prove next gen and it's not something that releasing new hardware or services can fix. They need games and tons of high quality games if they want to compete with Sony on a worldwide stage.",,QuadKnight,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,,,,,,,,

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm. Click to expand... I kind of tried to explain some of that to him, but he doesn't listen.

Yes, it is the right move IMO. For me (I don't have to deal with an uneven playing experience), for them (they don't have to let competitors get freebies on their back). As far as I'm concerned, Xbox has no place in the current landscape. Feel free to disagree, I'm not telling you what to think. If Xbox disappeared tomorrow, I wouldn't notice. I would certainly miss Nintendo and Sony though, so yes, MS has no place. - Yes, PS4 is the best system. It has the most players, period. Therefore, it is the most competitive platform, it stands a greater chance of having more of your friends on it, etc. Your ""scientific metrics"" really don't mean much, PC has the best performance and Xbox Live > PSN doesn't change anything, everyone would rather be where everyone else is. Hence, why would Sony agree to cross play with the stragglers. - Lol, not even remotely the same as your ridiculous DVD analogy. More like why doesn't Apple allow Google Play on their phones. It doesn't stop PlayStation users from using the content they bought. It stops people who bought the content somewhere else from squatting on Sony's system (more like someone who bought a ticket to their local theater expecting it to get them into the IMAX showing at a different location). - It doesn't stop you from playing the ""REST OF THE WORLD"". PS4 doesn't need to play against PC players, IMO that is not a good experience (PC has way more options for hardware / K&M > gamepad). That leaves the Switch, which I doubt has a sizable player count and the Xbox. The ONLY party that benefits from cross platform play would be MS and its comparatively meager player base. Not a big loss for PlayStation, maybe some of those people will switch to a better platform once they get tired of playing with themselves (ie. not with most of their friends). - I'll ignore your Stockholm Syndrome rant and most of that paragraph. If you explained this situation to any person who doesn't have a horse in the race, they would probably agree with me. Gaming consoles are not telephones, they don't need to work with each other. I'm not worried about Sony losing market share or not being the best place to game. It is the market leader and the best place to be. I just don't see how making stupid decisions are in their favor (allowing cross platform play). Not fear, just plain common sense and an aversion to seeing my preferred place to game being compromised by people suggesting dumb ideas. How have I contradicted myself? Why would anyone think less competition = better? Do you want Sony charging us $600 for a console again? Do you want them not to enact backwards compatibility next gen(PSNow is a far cry from true BC) Do you want them to have the same shitty infrastructure that they had during the PS3 era? I could continue on why less competition is bad. Believe it or it, but Microsoft’s Xbox has a place in the gaming industry. Thinking otherwise is delusional. You obviously have animosity and disdain toward Microsoft.",,Pallas,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Now it's three days later and I've already gotten $19.99 worth of entertainment, for free, and I'm looking through the library and holy crap, so many games. Played a few hours into God Of War, thinking it would be laggy, but it wasn't at all (I know GOW is going to be free for PSN members or whatever in a few days, so maybe that's a bad example).

I do not see an upside to proliferating these subscription based services. What was the upside in doing that? Now the only choices you have is to pay for online matchmaking and PlayStation Now which doesn't even offer new exclusives. EA Origin Premiere on the PC allows you to play new titles for less money (monthly plans) than PlayStation Now. So tell me again the downside when you can still buy new EA games for the PS4 and not subscribe to EA Access? Who cares if Ubisoft offered their own, they too would still have regular PS4 games to buy. FranXico said: Well, that's up to the market to decide, not a single company. And if that business model is indeed unsustainable, it will just die out. Exactly. If Sony thinks there is no value the consumer will quickly show those results. If everyone jumps onboard then clearly Sony is not offering a better alternative are they? Last edited: Today at 2:23 PM",,Louis Cyphre,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,,,,

PlayStation Now is a video game streaming service from Sony that allows PC and PS4 gamers to play over 650 PS4, PS3, and PS2 games. If you are unsure that you have the connection to stream the games, there is a free 7 day trial. The introductory pricing of the streaming service is $9.99 a month, $29.99 for 3 months of service, or $99.99 for a solid year of the subscription service. Although note that in order to take advantage of the $9.99 intro offer, you will need to purchase that directly, as the 7-day trial will transition into the standard monthly subscription. ====================::==================== I thought it already was months ago.",,DF-1,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Bloodborne Is Now Available for Streaming on the PC Through PlayStation Now,,,

I played the trial, but only beat half the game due to limited time. I may subscribe for a month on 9/26 so that I can play/finish RDR1 straight up until RDR2's release. Apparently Xbox 1 is a better version, but if you never saw it, or played it, what does it matter? As for the connection... on wifi, I was kicked from the server often. Then I connected a wire, and never had an issue. I played on the PSNOW client for PC, as well as right on my PS4. Both worked fine. I liked playing on my laptop, because I could lie in bed, and have a perfect view of it in my lap. I always hated how small the text was on R* games, so this method helped a ton.",,jay4523,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I was one of the hype-bois for Destiny one. Playstation fanboy since day one, and the creators of Halo were coming to Playstation now? SIGN ME UP! The first level was perfect. Voice narrated, timing of mob spawns was perfect, such an experience. The whole rest of the game after the tutorial was absolute dumpster-fire. All 4 of my friends I convinced to buy the game quit around the same time as me, no one ever turned it on again. Then they made Destiny 2. They PROMISED it would be different, new, exciting, fixing the old mistakes. But wait... the promise of Destiny 1 was a 10 year game life cycle. They literally advertised this as a selling point. So... how did it have a sequel already? Money. Greedy corporate money. The SAME graphics, the SAME playstyle, still a horrible story. I was watching gameplay of it and literally wasn't sure if it was D1 or D2. How on earth was it a sequel and not just an expansion? Anyways, none of us ever bought Destiny 2. Turns out this month it is now free to Playstation plus users. I don't think I'll be touching anything that studio puts its name on for a very long time, if ever.

Consolites are the ones trying to use individual sites, special conditions ( genre's don't count, asia doesn't count etc.) to win an argument that never stood up in the first place. So onto that list from game rankings. What PS4 lists are playable on PC: Well there you go, out of the top 50 PS4 titles, 40 of them can be played on PC. Vast majority of those playable on PC don't even need emulator or PSNow. Truly a lacklustre console and lineup. *Additional Lol, HZD would be ranked 104th on the PC list, between GTA 4 & The Operative: No One Lives Forever. You have literally and single handedly proven PC is nothing but a multiplat box and that PS4 is the place play if you like AAAE's. That's a better list to prove it then even I could find. help explain to me specifically why I as a PC gamer should care what anyone thinks about PC gaming if they are unwilling to factor in a game like The Forest or Space Engineers? how is your view given your parameters remotely relevant to anyone? Explain to me where I said those games don't count? Exactly....... And if my views aren't relevant why have you spent the last few days debating game count between platforms........ clown.

My family and I don't buy is***. We haven't owned a single apple product since a black and white apple mac many years ago. Windows and Android are much better when you factor everything in. I have a surface pro 3 and it's s***. The thermal design is inadequate, the Surface Pen 3 requires more pressure than you can safely apply to the screen without damaging it, and there's a myriad of software and driver issues with it. Apparently, Pro 3 was a real lemon, though, and the bottom of the Surface Pro barrel. Having used it professionally for over 2 years, I was happy for the first year and a half and then it started to fall apart because it wasn't made to actually be used for more than a year. The thermal design could be a little better I guess, you hear the fan crank up a good amount, but what do you expect, it in many respects pushes a full on PC in a tablet. I also am still able to leave it in Urban Armor without any real problems. I've had mine for about 3 years now without any major problems, I think I reinstalled Windows 10 once. I upgraded to Windows 10 on it almost right away though, so I'm not completely sure how 7 and 8 run on it. I did use the pen for awhile, but not on any super intensive tasks. I think it was like a year in though I switched over almost completely to a mouse along with the type cover. I like how I can pretty much use it just fine with a mouse and keyboard on just a folding table. I play some games on it with little problems and also run PSNow on it with almost no problems. I'm actually typing this message on it right now. I use it for personal use and not professional though, which I guess could matter, but I don't see it mattering to the point of where it is complete s***.",,Mozzezz,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

PlayStation Now is a video game streaming service from Sony that allows PC and PS4 gamers to play over 650 PS4, PS3, and PS2 games. If you are unsure that you have the connection to stream the games, there is a free 7 day trial. The introductory pricing of the streaming service is $9.99 a month, $29.99 for 3 months of service, or $99.99 for a solid year of the subscription service. Although note that in order to take advantage of the $9.99 intro offer, you will need to purchase that directly, as the 7-day trial will transition into the standard monthly subscription. ====================::==================== Excellent game.",,John721,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Bloodborne Is Now Available for Streaming on the PC Through PlayStation Now,,,

I just buckled down and bought a DS4. It's the best backup controller for PC anyway, especially with Steam installed. I mostly only use it for twin stick shooters and PSNow, but it is nice to have a dual stick controller for the rare situations when it's the best control option. If you don't have integrated bluetooth in your PC, be sure to buy a cheap bluetooth dongle to go with it. You can get one for less than $10 on Amazon in the US. You don't need a special dongle for the DS4, any bluetooth will do. Also, if you need one be sure to plug it into a USB 2.0 port and make sure it isn't too close to a USB port. USB 3.0 and Bluetooth don't get along well and will sometimes interfere with each other.",,contrabardus,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I usually game on Windows, but have a Mac for work that I've used to play games using the exact same setup. You only need the Sony adapter for PSNow on PC for PS4 support of the touchpad and gyro because Sony deliberately disabled features to force you to buy their dongle.

Need to reallocate bandwidth to PS4 using Virgin hub 3.0. Apologies if this is the wrong sub, I searched for Virgin - which worked out as well as you'd expect and the PS4 sub seems only about the games. Basically I subscribe to PSnow and for months have had no problems. This past week or so games keep exiting due to connection issues. I've looked online but nothing offered works and the rest is out of date. Other devices have twice the amount of bandwidth allocated when I looked at what was connected and the PS4 only a MB. When I do a speed test on the PS4 it's high so I don't think it's the connection itself. I'm using Virgin hub 3.0 and have very limited tech knowledge. I have really bad social anxiety and would not be able to follow verbal directions from Virgin customer support. I also maybe looking for the wrong solution due to poor technical knowledge so all solutions welcome. Thanks for reading.",,galacticfir3fly,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

DirkMcGurkin posted... ejay8320 posted... DirkMcGurkin posted... flame030191 posted... DirkMcGurkin posted... Video games make most of their money from software sales so your point is moot. Also yes, there are exclusive streaming services. Those aren't hardware and those streaming services aren't exclusive to hardware. I can play netflix on any brand of phone, tv, console, PC, tablet and on and on, regardless of brand. MOOT! lol So it’s bad for a game company to make exclusive content for their platform because you don’t own all of the platforms but it’s just fine for video streaming companies to make exclusive shows and movies for their platforms because you do pay for it? You can’t just pay for Netflix and give them a pass on keeping shows exclusive to their platform but then not buy a PS4 and get mad at Sony for keeping games exclusive to their console. You’re contradicting yourself. Sigh... I don't have to buy multiple hardware devices to enjoy the shows that are available on a streaming service. It doesn't matter what brand of TV or console or whatever that I buy, I can watch netflix on any of them. There is no contradiction and I'm not trying to change the world. I'm simply saying that it would be much better for the consumer if they didn't have to worry about which consoles to buy or not to buy just to be able to access all video games. So far the reasons against it have all been countered with facts and examples that it does work. Most importantly the fact that the majority of revenue comes form software sales. Why are you guys so against the idea of not having to buy several different brands of the same device? Nope you're ignoring our point No, you're bringing in a new argument and saying that I think it's ok for exclusive streaming content. What content is exclusive on netflix and hulu? Let's see in Canada I can't watch Star trek discovery on Netflix because another streaming service has the rights. I can't watch seven deadly sins on crnchyroll or the Funimation streaming service. I can keep going if you'd like... https://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Discovery-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B07G2D87C1/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1536171228&sr=8-2&keywords=star+trek+discovery https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Deadly-Sins-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B07D55HV8L/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1536171372&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=seven+deadly+sins&psc=1 There you go. Those aren't exclusive to netflix. You can buy Star Trek Discovery on disc and you don't even need a subscription to any streaming service. That's the problem with your argument. The content you speak of isn't exclusive. It can be purchased elsewhere to run on whatever hardware you own. So I have wait it out until it's available on another source... Well guess what you'll just have to wait it out until it will be on another source as well. Probably psnow years later or the PlayStation version of game pass. Both discs were not available during the release of either shows on their respective streaming sites.",,ejay8320,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

You can subscribe by the month, by 3 months, or by the year. The year option seems to only become available around Christmas each year. However, you can also purchase a PS3 game through PsNow. With this option, it's sort of like paying a one-time subscription fee for a life-time subscription for that one particular game. The real downside to PsNow is that the games are streamed to you through the internet. Bad internet connection = bad experience. This is what made me abandon my brand new PS4. I bought an old PS3 and installed CFW. Now I can download and play all the PS3 games I want - FOR FREE. Suck on that Sony!",,3wooki3,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Saying ""MS didn't make a good console"" is silly....they made the best one. Currently, PS4 owners can only play their PS3 games on their console with PsNow. That takes in a considerable sum for Sony, and allowing BC would finally bring Sony level with MS, but subscriptions to PSnow would inevitably suffer. I'd say BC is not 100% certain on ps5, especially given the amount of PS4 owners saying they don't care about BC, and nobody uses it. MS will start next gen with full BC, in line with x1, but seeing as Gamepass offers launch titles it won't be affected .... It's already up and running and Sony need to match it with an equivalent. Not saying X2 will outsell ps5, just saying that Sony actually have more challenges ahead than Ms. Xbox has a clear plan; Increase 1st party output (which saw ms buy 6 studios), produce a console capable of playing 4k 60fps at a lower price than Sony, launch first, improve and expand Gamepass, and support BC and Crossplay. Sony have to start supporting BC and Crossplay, introduce a gamepass rival, produce more first party games than Ms, as well as match the other criteria. They also have to decide whether or not to continue to support VR which has hardly set the world on fire.",,sealionact,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Forums,,,,,,,,

Click to expand... Yeah, 720p is maximum and this is 2018. No thanks! I wouldn't want it even if it was free, otherwise if performance and lag were reasonable it could be useful for crappy laptop gaming or on TV without the need of connecting a proper gaming PC or buying a console. This could be a reason they don't want to offer higher res as to not cut into their console sales.",,zkostik,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Bloodborne Is Now Available for Streaming on the PC Through PlayStation Now,,,

The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm. Click to expand... I kind of tried to explain some of that to him, but he doesn't listen. Maybe he just needs to develop the game and show us all how it's done.",,WoodenSaucer,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,***The PC Games Discussion Thread*** | Page 57,,,

So I have wait it out until it's available on another source... Well guess what you'll just have to wait it out until it will be on another source as well. Probably psnow years later or the PlayStation version of game pass. Both discs were not available during the release of either shows on their respective streaming sites. I’m fine with waiting a few months for exclusives to become multiplat. Irrelevant comparison anyway. You’re reaching to defend a practice that only burdens the consumer. Moving goal posts and changing the argument away from hardware because you can’t counter my claim. No matter how you look at it, I don’t need Netflix to watch the shows you listed. You seem very passionate about exclusives and having less choice so I’ll agree to disagree with your opinion. And you act like there is no benefits for exclusivity... You think Sony or Nintendo would put the same amount of money or effort if there was no exclusives? They won't be ause they won't have to because they won't have to sell the hardware to need to. I believe with the added revenue from thier IPs being purchased by three times as many people would be a benefit.",,DirkMcGurkin,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

You are talking about cluster and distributed computing. There are several applications where this is used frequently, like seti@home and folding@home, so what you are proposing is not really new. The main reason that has not taken off in the gaming ecosystem is that it would be nearly impossible to design for. Running any game locally is going to put a load on your hardware, even when you are streaming games through services like PSNow or Gamefly streaming, with the main bulk of that load being placed on your network connection, and it is designed for low end machines that would not have significant extra power to contribute to the cluster. There are many people out there that still have either crappy internet speeds, or their ISP caps the data they can use before getting overage charges, so having their machine act as part of the cluster and eat up their data is not going to appeal to them. Look at the backlash MS got about the online requirements of the XB1 before it's launch. If you are running high end hardware running games locally puts a moderate stress on your machine (I typically see 30-50% loads on the CPU and 60-70% load on the GPU), and the thought of a game pushing that to max, adding extra stress to your hardware, is not attractive to gamers either. The most realistic implementation is what MS was talking about with Crackdown 3, using their servers to assist in the processing of in-game destruction for the individual consoles, but the consoles themselves don't add to their server farm's power. Infact the amount of extra processing power that would be gained by the nodes doing the processing as well, in addition to the cost of designing around that theory, would be insignificant when compared to the cost and added performance of adding another local node to the server farm.",,FinalDrive,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,***The PC Games Discussion Thread*** | Page 57,,,

PlayStation Now is a video game streaming service from Sony that allows PC and PS4 gamers to play over 650 PS4, PS3, and PS2 games. If you are unsure that you have the connection to stream the games, there is a free 7 day trial. The introductory pricing of the streaming service is $9.99 a month, $29.99 for 3 months of service, or $99.99 for a solid year of the subscription service. Although note that in order to take advantage of the $9.99 intro offer, you will need to purchase that directly, as the 7-day trial will transition into the standard monthly subscription. ====================::==================== DF-1 said: ↑ I thought it already was months ago.

However this same issue seems to keep popping up in forums and happening to ps4 owners since at least last year and most of the time seems to ""go right"" for people within a few days,so best advice is to hold tight,make Sony aware maybe?

Correct which is why i think I was turned off by BC to start with. I had plenty of fun with COD games though. As far as being an amazing feature? I just don't see it but thats your opinion like my opinion is that its nice but its not on the list of reasons why I would buy a console. As far as RDR as an example you can play it on PS4 as well if you really wanted to. Instead of buying the game outright you would simply signup for the PSNOW service. Again this is not a bash on Xbox at all (its my primary system). I just have a personal opinion that BC is not really a primary feature. I want new games instead of games I put 100s of hours in 10 years ago.,,JoyousGamer,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Saying ""MS didn't make a good console"" is silly....they made the best one. Currently, PS4 owners can only play their PS3 games on their console with PsNow. That takes in a considerable sum for Sony, and allowing BC would finally bring Sony level with MS, but subscriptions to PSnow would inevitably suffer. I'd say BC is not 100% certain on ps5, especially given the amount of PS4 owners saying they don't care about BC, and nobody uses it. MS will start next gen with full BC, in line with x1, but seeing as Gamepass offers launch titles it won't be affected .... It's already up and running and Sony need to match it with an equivalent. Not saying X2 will outsell ps5, just saying that Sony actually have more challenges ahead than Ms. Xbox has a clear plan; Increase 1st party output (which saw ms buy 6 studios), produce a console capable of playing 4k 60fps at a lower price than Sony, launch first, improve and expand Gamepass, and support BC and Crossplay. Sony have to start supporting BC and Crossplay, introduce a gamepass rival, produce more first party games than Ms, as well as match the other criteria. They also have to decide whether or not to continue to support VR which has hardly set the world on fire. Gamepass and Crossplay haven't moved the needle at all for MS this gen. What makes you think Sony needs to support these features going forward into the next gen? Not saying these features aren't nice to have, they are good but the market has shown they generally do not give a crap. MS are the ones that need to prove a lot going into next gen. I don't know if you noticed but Halo and Gears aren't what they used to be, and those are MS' two biggest IPs. MS bought 6 studios but some of them have already been working on MS games in the past, two of them released flops as a matter of fact. Playground Studios and Ninja Theory are the only guys there with proven hits this gen. The Initiative doesn't have a single game to their name and is just a log at this point. Other than dealing with having to revitalize stagnant IPs like Halo and Gears, MS also has to establish new IPs going forward and none of their new IPs this gen have been successful which is almost the complete opposite for Sony who seem to have the Midas touch this gen. MS has to not only fix their fist party games problem which is a tall order in itself they have to also regain customer confidence that they lost in markets like Europe. They're doing well in the US to regain their footing but they've totally lost Europe to Sony and in Asia they might as well not exist. MS have a shut ton to prove next gen and it's not something that releasing new hardware or services can fix. They need games and tons of high quality games if they want to compete with Sony on a worldwide stage. Forgive me, but which New IP's have been successfull for Sony this gen? i get Horizon Zero dawn was but what others. dont forget that Sony just dropped Ready at Dawn and closed evolution, NMS was a full on disaster too. Titanfall 1 was a success, the second one was a crappier MP game but with a good single player. Sea of thieves has been popular, PUBG and plenty of others have done well on xbox, you seem to have sony tinted glasses on dude. Spiderman and Bloodborne. Sea of Thieves isn't popular. It was popular the month it dropped and fell off the charts. PUBG is dying and doesn't even have a majority of its population on Xbox. The Xbox launch of PUBG has generally been a disaster since the port has been shitty.

The series as a whole, is some of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. I don't remember being genuinely this happy to be playing games in years. My only regret is not having played these games earlier; I'd never seen these games advertised and had to go out of my way to find out about them.

PlayStation Now is a video game streaming service from Sony that allows PC and PS4 gamers to play over 650 PS4, PS3, and PS2 games. If you are unsure that you have the connection to stream the games, there is a free 7 day trial. The introductory pricing of the streaming service is $9.99 a month, $29.99 for 3 months of service, or $99.99 for a solid year of the subscription service. Although note that in order to take advantage of the $9.99 intro offer, you will need to purchase that directly, as the 7-day trial will transition into the standard monthly subscription.",,cageymaru,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Bloodborne Is Now Available for Streaming on the PC Through PlayStation Now,,,

I hold no bias over Xbox vs. Playstation. ​ Now we all know competition is healthy in any environment. Especially between corporations. The idea behind it is basic Capitalism. You have two or more companies/corporations that are trying to win in sales of their product. Usually it turns into who creates the better product. This is true in most cases. However I believe that the competition between Xbox and Playstation is not healthy for the gaming community as a whole. Like I stated before, I am looking at this situation as an outsider with no bias. ​ The competition has had many GOOD impacts on the gaming community. Technological advancements, marketing, and overall growth of the gamer community has been the result of the console wars. But now things are different. It is no longer Playstation and Xbox that are the bulk of gamers. PC is beginning to dominate. The reasons are mainly technological advancements, and the gamers that started as teenagers are now holding jobs and able to pay for a decent gaming PC. The interesting thing about PC is that the limitations of a console are nonexistent. You can have FAR better performance, you can play almost any game you want. Hell, I can go from playing a game to watching Youtube, to going onto word start working on research material for school. All within a click of a button. ​ Back to the point. PC is now beginning to flourish and is drawing in gamers from all sorts of demographics. Whether it be you are a hardcore gamer that is looking for the higher competitiveness in esports. Mass amount of available games through platforms like steam and valve. You want to play games that are exclusive to PC like the popular League of Legends. You desire more control over your own system in the fact that every couple years you can change out the graphics card or any other hardware for better hardware without having to get a whole new system. All of these are reasons to switch due to consoles not being able to do any of these. The main draw to console is price and.... exclusives. Now, I don't have a problem with price, but exclusives... they can be a problem if they get out of hand. My opinion on exclusives is that generally they aren't and issue, unless you look at the case of Destiny. Exclusive content like in COD with certain maps being Xbox exclusive for the first month is no big deal. In Destiny this is taken from one month to a WHOLE YEAR. Sometimes it gets delayed even longer, which was seen in Destiny 1. This issue goes back to when Sony struck a deal with Activision/Bungie for 500 million dollars to basically (I am dumbing this down for myself and you as the reader) have control over the schedule on releases, mandatory DLC content, micro transactions, and exclusive content for a year (Exclusive for PS4 of course). ​ Now why is this an issue? I really struggle answering this question because I see both sides. Sony basically saved Activision/Bungie from going bankrupt through this deal. The moral gamer in me knows (or thinks) that Sony is overstepping their boundaries to monopolize gaming. I ask myself questions like ""Shouldn't competition be on who makes the better product... not who has more money can monopolize and suck out more money from people from this practice?"". I also ask ""What would I do if I were Sony or Activision/Bungie?"". I think the practice Sony is doing is wrong, but I am not sure I would have done anything different in their shoes. So I am asking y'all. Is it hurtful to the gaming community for practice like this which happens all the time in todays day and age? If so, or if not, why? ​ Maybe you will read this and see me as a salty PC gamer which is valid, but I am doing best to be open minded about this subject since it affects all of us and our wallets.",,PeanutInTheKnow,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,
