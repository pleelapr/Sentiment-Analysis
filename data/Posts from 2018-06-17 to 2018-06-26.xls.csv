Well if PsNow dont incorperate day one exclusives then if wont last. They also need to bring the service to pc, making every game they make multiplat. Can you see them doing this? Difference is if say Zenimax made a service (which is unlikely) and given the strong relationship MS have with Bethesda, MS wouldn't fund some sort of deal with them? Streaming services rely on content, and funding for it, and if this is the future then MS have the funds to make such deals happen. I think you're having a completely different conversation... I'm talking about how it'll be in a decade or so when streaming is the default way to play games and not consoles. There won't be such a thing as Multiplatform games as far as the major publishers go. EA at E3 announced their plans for a streaming service, Capcom will be streaming RE7 to switch so they're also testing the waters, other publishers like Bethesda, Ubisoft, Take-Two, WB, etc. will no doubt follow suit. There's no question of Sony having exclusives in that space as their streaming service like everyone else's will be available on all devices, there also won't be a question of their games being on it day 1 as it will be the default method of delivering their games. Games will basically be exclusive to each publisher's own streaming service not a hardware device. The deals will only come into play regarding independent developers or small publishers who don't have a big enough game output or capital to warrant their own service, which basically consists of Indies and mostly Japanese publishers who aren't Square Enix, Capcom, or Namco. In light of that I think it's good that MS is investing in it's first party because exclusives will be the be all end all of any company that wants to stay in the gaming business.",,Mariobhai007,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Why would they fall back on base? I see them utilizing ""two gens"" in terms of development, and the 3rd falling back and offering the bare minimum, if it's offered at all (a la Wii last gen).

Click to expand... At the end of the day whether you play on xbox or pc it is all MS so why would they care? You are still part of their ecosystem. Click to expand... Exactly that's why they do it. I don't buy $59.99 games or $399.99 consoles from Microsoft but rather get a cheap pass to play whatever I want. Sony should do the same thing so I can get rid of my Playstation and just play games on my PC. The alternative as I mentioned is they could be cutting into renting/used games revenue which is a return in itself even if they're not getting the console adoption rates anymore. A single unified platform by subscribing to a few services is far more attractive. Nintendo is on the cross-play hype train. Archaic ass Nintendo online. Sony needs to stop being complacent and start realizing their competition is starting to surpass them slowly in other ways. Portability playing anywhere on any device is the future. With Sony's PSNow they could take it a bigger step forward than what Microsoft has now. Allow me to install the app on any android/iOS device. My windows PC. Play anywhere anytime without needing a PS4. That's far more attractive and would be your service in the hands of unlimited consumer/commercial potential. They need to first get their head of their asses and stop sitting into a single small closed ecosystem before it can exist. This is the world we live in with technology where you can access anything anywhere at anytime. That's where the next step of innovation needs to go in console gaming. They already have remote play so why not continue building on it?,,deuce985,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

And while one - dubbed Project Scarlett - is expected to be a traditional console to go up against Sony’s expected PlayStation 5, the other is believed by insiders to be a rival to Google’s upcoming offering.

The Yeti will boast cloud-based gaming machine which will look like a normal console but offer a streaming service where you can play any game instantly via the internet on Google’s servers.

With an expected monthly subscription, it’ll mean you’ll never have to download a game again, but simply pick one on the server and play instantly.

Matt Booty, head of Microsoft Studios, admitted at the E3 video game conference this week huge amounts of effort at the firm is being put into a rival service to take on giant Google.

He teased that although streamable gaming might seem a rather distant prospect, cloud technology is already in place in pretty much every game with an online component.

“These days, multiplayer games depend so much on servers and matchmaking that’s hosted in the cloud,“ Booty said.

""It really is pervasive. It’s what allows things to be saved across platforms; it’s what allows virtual currency to transfer around. 

“The cloud has enabled a whole new world in terms of what games can do with multiplayer.”

And Xbox boss Phil Spencer added: “The biggest challenge I feel now is gamers’ desire to continue to divide our industry. 

“The mentality is that somebody must fail in order for someone else to succeed … we all want to think about how we grow the gaming business, to not create arbitrary decisions on what console you buy or what network you join.

""The more we work together as an industry, better things happen. 

""You have an Android and I have an iPhone; I can still call you. That would be my hope: that we still compete, but we compete on creative and quality.”

Microsoft is tapping into its Azure cloud infrastructure team to develop its new game streaming service that will deliver ‘Xbox-quality games’ to a range of other devices, including mobile phones.

“Our cloud engineers are building a game streaming network to unlock console-quality gaming on any device,” the Xbox E3 audience were told.

“We are dedicated to perfecting your experience everywhere you want to play — your Xbox, your PC and your phone.”

Azure already has a dedicated gaming division that works with outside developers, and Xbox itself launched a service in March to assist gaming developers to use Azure cloud services.

It comes after a report in February said that Google was building a game streaming service with the working name of “Yeti.” 

A bit like its namesake, it has never been officially confirmed but is claimed to be a games-as-a-service platform similar to Sony’s PlayStation Now or Nvidia’s GeForce Now that would host games on the cloud and allow users to instantly stream all available titles.

The concept is not a new one, but it has struggled in the past.

OnLive, the first company to have attempted the concept back in 2007, went bust in 2014.

Microsoft has the advantage of being able to trade on its name and that of the Xbox heritage along with having a wealth of titles to tap into once the device launches, giving it a solid footing even before the first device is sold.

Ten years ago, the mass adoption of streaming music and video services may have seemed unrealistic, yet today both dominate their respective markets. 

Gaming could head in the same direction.

But the videogame industry hasn’t fully embraced the idea of “cloud” services—delivering programs over an internet connection—because the remote server has to respond immediately to unpredictable game play rather than just transmit a prerecorded song or movie. > >Capcom, based in Osaka, released a cloud version of its “Resident Evil 7” for the Switch game machine in Japan last month, charging about $18 for 180 days of access compared with as much as $50 for those who download the game for other devices. > >Now the maker of Mega Man, Street Fighter and Monster Hunter franchises is looking at other titles to include in its cloud service, people with direct knowledge of the matter at Capcom said. It isn’t clear which titles will be released or when. > >A Capcom spokeswoman said the company would decide whether to expand its cloud offerings after assessing the performance of the “Resident Evil 7” Switch version. > >Capcom is in a small group of early birds including Sony Corp. and [Square Enix Holdings](http://quotes.wsj.com/JP/XTKS/9684) Co. that have begun to invest in cloud game services. Sony offers PlayStation Now, a cloud-based game-streaming program available in the U.S., Japan and parts of Europe, while Square Enix has released several titles available through the cloud in Japan, including “Dragon Quest X” for Nintendo’s 3DS hand-held device. > >Game makers like the idea of cloud games because they can extend the life of a previously released title or, in the case of services such as PlayStation Now, provide regular revenue through monthly fees. > >Companies are still trying to sort out the business model for a game service, including how profit would be shared among software makers, hardware makers and the telecommunications companies that connect the remote server to the consumer. > >Another challenge is getting the technology right. Some players of the cloud version of Capcom’s “Resident Evil 7” have said the gameplay quality is jerky. > >Engineers say the issue generally lies in inadequate internet connections on the consumers’ side, especially if they are sharing a connection with neighbors in an apartment complex. The industry is betting that next-generation wireless technology, often referred to as fifth-generation or 5G, will address the problem with faster and more-reliable internet access. > >Making a cloud version of already-completed games doesn’t require much investment, say people in the industry. Capcom has already released “Resident Evil 7” as downloaded or packaged software for the PlayStation 4, [Microsoft](http://quotes.wsj.com/MSFT) Corp.’s Xbox One and personal computers. > >The Switch is less powerful than the other game machines. By keeping the bulk of the software in the cloud, Capcom relies less on the Switch’s computing power and saves money in adapting the game. Users need to download only a small “client” program to play. > >Analysts said game makers are likely to release their major titles first as packaged or downloaded software for purchase at a higher price, and then make them available over the cloud later. Software publishers hunting for larger audiences can use this “post-launch monetization” to reduce reliance on initial sales, said Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at research firm [IHS Markit](http://quotes.wsj.com/INFO) . > >If Capcom’s effort is successful, more companies known for high-end games would likely look at cloud versions for the Nintendo Switch, which has small built-in storage. > >Still, it isn’t clear how much support the idea would gain from Nintendo because the Kyoto-based company tends to take a conservative approach to any technology that isn’t ready for the mass market, including virtual reality. Also, cloud gaming goes against the Switch’s key concept of “play anytime, anywhere, with anyone” because it requires the device to be connected continuously to the internet.

I wonder how this will work out. Electronic Arts shares will rise due to the success of its subscription gaming services, according to one Wall Street firm. Needham reiterated its buy rating for EA shares, saying its subscription business is already worth $3 billion to the company. ""We believe that EA is building a Netflix for video games,"" analyst Laura Martin said in a note to clients Friday. ""It is our view that millennials want to rent content (eg, Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu) rather than own it, and that content companies with data about what their consumers view/play/use create valuation upside from programming, eCommerce, and advertising revenue streams."" Martin raised her price target to $170 from $135 for EA shares, representing 19 percent upside from Thursday's close. The analyst noted the company announced a new, more expensive tier for its PC subscription gaming service called ""Origin Access Premier"" priced at $14.99 per month or $100 per year. The new tier enables consumers to play EA's biggest games as they are launched. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/buy...ilding-a-netflix-for-video-games-needham.html I only wish hat Ubisoft is doing it. ====================::==================== Turtlejuice said: ↑ PlayStation now does more than games now?

It's excellent technology but here the cell providers are absolutely bonkers with their data caps and hidden fees they charge every month on our bills. Unfortunately, all the bureaucracy itself will prevent something like streaming games to be big in USA. Way too much greed with a shitty infrastructure. Click to expand... Wait, are you saying that greed is ruining gaming? Click to expand... I'm saying ISPs in the US are going to prevent game streaming from getting big until they move past data cap restrictions. I personally don't have them but a lot of areas have some pretty tight caps. Cell infrastructure sucks in the US too or at least that's what they claim which is why they put very restrictive caps on us. You're lucky to have a wireless plan that gets 10-15GBs data on it a month. That's not a lot just doing even a little streaming in high resolutions. 4K would eat most of that data plan up in an hour. Landline is mostly restricted based on area. That's probably why Sony hasn't put much effort at all into promoting PSNow. It's a lost cause until US infrastructure can get their head out of their ass which we all know the US is a big market for it probably biggest. My state has a lot of red tape to go through when it tries to make more consumer-friendly practices when it comes to things like data caps. I'm lucky enough to have Charter as my ISP and they were forced to put certain obligations when they bought out TWC. One of them was they couldn't put data caps on us, they had to have at least 200mbps down in all markets and they couldn't throttle connections for any reason. We need tighter regulations on the ISPs/Cell providers because they're out of control. So in sense yes, they're restricting technology's capability here due to greed.",,deuce985,United States of America,,,Negative,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,

Xbox Game Pass is $10 a month & lets you install games rather than stream, and includes first-party titles on Day One. - Sony did not allow EA Access to come to PS4, ostensibly because it didn't offer a good enough ""value"" to its customers - despite costing less for *one year* than PSNow costs for *two months*. But you can get it on Xbox. - Their premium 4K console, the PS4 Pro, struggles to run most games at native 4K, pushing developers to use checkerboarding to achieve a ""close enough"" 4K image. It's also lacking a 4K bluray player. The Xbox One X has both. - Microsoft's outreach and support for developers means that there are considerably more ""Enhanced"" games for their X1X console than there are for the Pro. - The aforementioned crossplay thing: it's a big deal, not just because they're not allowing crossplay (the ""Microsoft didn't a few years ago either!"" argument is valid, I think), but because they're actually blocking accounts that have ever logged in to *Fortnite* on a PS4 from logging in on other platforms. That's a pretty malicious move and sets a bad precedent. It's the kind of thing they wouldn't be doing if they were in 2nd or 3rd place this gen.",,darkpassenger9,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I already have a gaming PC that can access PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) via PSNow, so for me the Xbox One X was the supplemental console choice that I needed. The Xbox One X again is the best model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor The One X is also better than my PC right now on multi-platforms at least until I can upgrade my gpu Finally aside from those mentioned above many of which were added post launch, Microsoft is dedicated to adding even more features based on feedback from their customers, including Dolby Vision and support for the upcoming 2.1 HDMI standard and has been open to lending some of their iconic characters to Nintendo for use in their games. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. Forgot to mention Gamepass(and EA Access as well) as additional nice features for the Xbox One X not found on the PS4 Pro, the best console gaming subscription in the market allowing you to play the latest(and multiple) AAA games on launch with a reasonable and affordable subscription fee without having to pay $60 or more to buy each game.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

The game's difficulty lies pretty much solely in it's control scheme. Take that away and you have a stupidly simple action game. It is not like REMake where you can make the game a little simpler while still maintaining a lot of what made the original games challenging. It would make the games a complete cake walk. And like I said before, a game with tank controls is not going to have enough mainstream appeal to even warrant a remake/remaster. Best you could hope for is if the games show up on Playstation Now.

31aa7dfe-2a1d-4320-b8d4-06b450b48612,6/26/2018,http://www.walb.com/story/38524087/xbox-two-xbox-2020-everything-we-know-about-microsofts-next-console,"By Gabe Gurwin Content Provided by Les Shu/Digital Trends It’s been nearly five years since the launch of the Xbox One, and the console has changed significantly over that time with the discontinuation of Kinect, full redesign of the Xbox One S, and major enhancements of the Xbox One X . But revisions like these can only get a console so far, and it has us thinking about what comes next — including the very name of the product. Will it be called the Xbox 2020? Or perhaps the Xbox Two? Here is everything we know about the next Xbox console. It’s currently being designed During Microsoft’s E3 2018 presentation, head of Xbox Phil Spencer revealed that Microsoft is currently designing the architecture for the next generation of Xbox consoles. The team working on the project is the same one behind the Xbox One X. Curiously, Spencer said “consoles” rather than “console” when announcing this news during the conference. We’ve heard reports that Microsoft could be planning more than one console, possibly in an attempt to capitalize on both casual and hardcore players. It will likely feature game streaming Les Shu/Digital Trends Sony’s PlayStation Now subscription service allows PlayStation 4 users to stream games from the cloud instead of buying and downloading them outright, and in Japan, the Nintendo Switch has even flirted with this for Resident Evil 7 . No such service exists on the Xbox One, but during Microsoft’s E3 2018 presentation, Phil Spencer revealed that his team is currently developing cloud gaming technology that will allow you to play console-quality titles from several devices. It goes without saying that the next Xbox will be one of the supported systems, and this service could save players money if they want to try a game for a few hours before purchasing it. However, it’s very unlikely that the next Xbox will drop support for discs. The Xbox One S and X are the only two consoles on the market that support 4K Blu-ray discs, and with internet speeds still slow in much of the United States, physical games still serve a purpose. It will likely be backward compatible The Xbox One introduced backward compatibility with Xbox 360 games a few years ago, and it eventually added backward compatibility with original Xbox games, as well. It appears this will continue with the next generation of Xbox, though what form this will take remains unclear. Speaking to Eurogamer , Phil Spencer said he is “very proud of [Xbox’s] track record of compatibility” and that he wants to respect players’ previous purchases. Nothing concrete was revealed, but this certainly makes it sound like Xbox One games will be supported on the next Xbox. Virtual reality won’t become reality Mike Nichols, Microsoft’s Chief Marketing Officer for Xbox, squashed the rumors about virtual reality support by telling Gameindustry.biz that “We don’t have any plans specific to Xbox” for VR, or even mixed reality. The “specific to Xbox” phrase could give Microsoft an out, since it’s possible the company could bring over technology from Windows. Still, that seems like a long shot, because Microsoft has struggled there, too. The hardware will be similar, but quicker There’s no firm rumors about what will be in next Xbox, but there’s also not many options. Both Microsoft and Sony turned to using x86-based processors, like those found in PCs, with the latest console generation. They also turned to using AMD to build graphics. Both those solutions remains the most sensible, so it’s unlikely we’ll see anything different in the next Xbox. That said, the follow-up will of course be more powerful than the Xbox One X. The architecture of the current Xbox One and Xbox One X suggest the company has many opportunities for improvement. It could increase the CPU core count, change the CPU architecture, or upgrade to a new GPU architecture, like AMD’s Vega or perhaps even Navi, which isn’t yet in production but is on AMD’s roadmap. It’s codenamed ‘Scarlett’ and it’s two years away According to Thurrott’s Brad Sams , the next Xbox consoles are being codenamed “Scarlett,” similar to how the Xbox One X was referred to as “Project Scorpio” before its final name was revealed. The same report claimed the systems are planned for release in 2020, which would fall in line with Microsoft’s general timeline for hardware launches. The Xbox 360 was followed by the Xbox One eight years later, but that was an unusually long time for a console generation. Given the relatively low sales numbers for the Xbox One since its launch, expediting this process seems likely.

No reason to voluntarily go into gaming purgatory. Have you seen the suffering on the xb1 board this gen? They all hate this gen, believe it or not. Not at all. The Xbox One X has restored the confidence of many Xbox fans and with the direction that Microsoft has taken in terms of acquiring 5 new studios to develop first party games, exclusives is not going to be an issue in the future as well. The fact is that even post launch Microsoft continues to add features to their console and has been very receptive to feedback from their customers as to which they want to add even more. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti-consumer practices in their arrogance. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. Not really confidence but has turned into a fantroll paradise that board is toxic. Actually I noticed that a lot of Sony fanboys have migrated to the Xbox One boards because it seems that the PS4 board has become obsessed with this SJW nonsense and because complaints about Sony not allowing their gamers to play with Switch owners, instead of talking about games. The only toxicity I noticed on the Xbox One boards is when the Sony fanboys invade those boards, and attack Xbox One owners in a disrespectful manner. I also notice them doing the same thing on the PC and Nintendo boards.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I already have a gaming PC that can access PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) via PSNow, so for me the Xbox One X was the supplemental console choice that I needed. The Xbox One X again is the best model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor The One X is also better than my PC right now on multi-platforms at least until I can upgrade my gpu Finally aside from those mentioned above many of which were added post launch, Microsoft is dedicated to adding even more features based on feedback from their customers, including Dolby Vision and support for the upcoming 2.1 HDMI standard and has been open to lending some of their iconic characters to Nintendo for use in their games. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. Forgot to mention Gamepass(and EA Access as well) as additional nice features for the Xbox One X not found on the PS4 Pro, the best console gaming subscription in the market allowing you to play the latest(and multiple) AAA games on launch with a reasonable and affordable subscription fee without having to pay $60 or more to buy each game. You do realise that psnow exists right? I personally prefer gamepass cos I'd rather download than stream but there are a lot of points in psnows favour e.g. A much bigger library of games. And btw, there haven't been any AAA games on gamepass at launch so far",,OneTruePlayer81,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

TTT2 already gives the option for solo play (and you seem to run into many that utilize it, and can always develop friends who agree to play that way), so, I mean yeah there's not really a point. TTT2 definitely has higher input lag than T7 though, and I did track down some numbers and it's at least 1 or 2 frames higher than PS4 T7's after the patch, which sucks for going back to TTT2. =/ Would be cool if Bamco officially rereleases it on PS4 or PS5 (not just PSNow, and obviously it would be more likely on the PS5 at this point), with better netcode and the excuse for more people to make it active again. I suppose they could boost or upscale the resolution to full 1080p while they're at it (pls don't make it stutter like TTT1 HD...). As far as Revolution went, aside from stats, invincibles, and the whole paywall framework (including being encouraged to pay for character unlocks or for simplified outfit options), for a solo game it probably was more like what I've always loved about the series, since without juggle extenders and oki relaunches its pacing was once again like T3 and T5. And for a mainstream casual audience, simplification and fully appealing play is necessary. Tekken currently gets less and less appealing for many non-hardcore fans the longer they're bounced around in extended juggles; they don't care about the damage, just how often they don't have active player agency. I feel llike T8 has to simplify itself down even further if it really wants to reclaim mainstream appeal. It is possible to do that while retaining technicality and higher-level complexity, but focusing on ways to keep evolving the juggling system into more and more complex territory isn't the answer. Funny enough, nobody asked for or wanted juggle extenders and when T6 came about I remember the type of reception it received. I for one was absolutely livid with the bound system/rage system. I though it was a step back from the getgo. In fact I and many others who shared this opinion were basically told to ""shut up and deal with it""...hmm...kind of like how things are now You could say they wanted to add something new and distinguish T6 from the previous games, but it always felt forced. A lot of other games were heavy jugglers and Namco basically wanted to catch up with this gaming ""fad"" if you will. Hmm....again kind of like how things are now. Interesting... But in the end all it did was make us appreciate the original format of Tekkens gaming. And as you say, that's where future titles need to return to in order to keep Tekken going strong. I mean we all eventually adapted to the bound stuff, but what choice did we have? All we wanted was to play our fav characters in the new installment with improved graphics, movelists and animations. Juggle extenders were crammed down our throats and it drove many(casuals in particular) away. Tag 2 took that to the Nth degree and the result was even worse. But last night I experienced what Tag 2 could've been with some minor tweaking, and it was pretty damn great.",,MeteorStone,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

It's a good but extremely niche series which never was as good as people wanted you to believe. Yeah, it's not as good as people would have you believe. It's better! I've played through the 5 Trails games that got released in the West and they're phenomenal, especially the Cold Steel games. Unfortunately, like all Nihon Falcom games, they're incredibly niche. I don't think the dev has ever had one breakout hit in the West, and as a result most US gamers aren't even aware of their existence. Anyway, if anyone is a fan of old school turn-based RPG mechanics, and doesn't mind anime style visuals and tropes, you're almost guaranteed to love this series. Agreed I played them both on psnow they were games that I had heard people talking about for a while and how great they are and they do not disappoint, maybe when cold steel 3 comes to the West they will breakout of that much a bit more. They are definitely some of the better turn based rpgs out there.",,Sammycakes88,United States of America,,,Positive,Sadness,Forums,,,,,,,,

First is Backwards compatibility on PS5. I believe Sony has taken notice that MS has been doing BC right this gen and wont fuck it up with ps5 but who knows? They may try and get you to need psnow or some shit. If it is 100% BC with ps4 games that would greatly increase my desire for the system and making upgrading during launch or the launch window much more appealing. 2nd would be how soon I end up jumping on the 4kHDR train. The TCL 6 series seems perfect at $1,000 for a 65"" model if I bite the bullet and go for it this year or next that would make a next gen console more desirable sooner. Also depends how much of an upgrade the hardware is vs the pro (and more so x1X) since regardless once I buy a 4kHDR tv I plan on grabbing a pro on the cheap via CL. It's not ALL about graphics but I want to see if psvr2 is a large leap forward, if the game worlds and AI have advanced enough to warrant an early adoption. Also a 4k bluray player is a must even though I'm debating a X1S for that reason now. It seems 2-3 years away which is fine. I'd welcome it next year and I'm ok with waiting it out as like many others seem to I have a crazy backlog this gen with well over a dozen or two must have games on the horizon.",,DenverVikingsFan91,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I am posting it again for you; I have been PC gaming for about 5 years now but decided to get an Xbox One X instead of a PS4 Pro recently (after the price of gpus became probitively expensive) for the following reasons: I already have a gaming PC that can access PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) via PSNow, so for me the Xbox One X was the supplemental console choice that I needed. The Xbox One X again is the best model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Gamepass subscription - allowing you to play the latest(and multiple) AAA games on launch with a reasonable and affordable subscription fee without having to pay $60 or more to buy each game. In contrast PSNow only has older PS3 and PS4 games. Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor The One X is also better than my PC right now on multi-platforms at least until I can upgrade my gpu Finally aside from those mentioned above many of which were added post launch, Microsoft is dedicated to adding even more features based on feedback from their customers, including Dolby Vision and support for the upcoming 2.1 HDMI standard and has been open to lending some of their iconic characters to Nintendo for use in their games. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting anti-consumer practices in their arrogance. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Allowing downloading of PS4 titles to run locally, with online, sign in and primary console requirements for license verification is an obvious answer too. But realistically what is needed to ""fix"" PSNow is to remove those ludicrous regional differences. In the US there are data centers in almost every state keeping latency down, a library of over 700 titles with regular additions and costs just $99 per year. In Europe there aren't even data centers in every country so latency is a huge issue, and some countries can't access the service at all, the library is smaller and updated less frequently and with fewer titles and costs £156 per year or to put in USD over $250.

They will keep their games exclusive to their respective service and the idea of Multiplatform will be next to non-existent barring smaller independent games who will license their games to either one or multiple services owned by all the major publishers. Cross-play is a flash in the pan concept at this point as it's days are numbered. So as Sony has the worse service out the lot... they're doomed? Isn't Sony the only one that has a streaming service at all at this point? You really think giving that MS have Azure cloud servers, and the tech and knowledge to provide such a service, that'll itll be worse than what Sony offer? PsNow is overpriced, and has latency issues. Streaming won't be in effect for a decade yet. MS has all the pieces in place with Game Pass, and also looking yo bring streaming to mobile devices Exactly, Sony has a decade to fine tune their already existing infrastructure. Your whole point is pretty moot, in a decade or so it'll be common place and every publisher will be able to employ a streaming service. Your argument is basically that all other companies will in a decade be able to put together a better service from thin air while Sony's already existing one will stay the same as it is right now?",,Mariobhai007,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

This kind of ludicrous nonsense is right up there with releasing the PS4 Pro without a UHD player. Even the base ($299) XBone S has one. All that considered, the PS4 is a fantastic console which I have been quite happy with but Sony made some seriously poor decisions during the creation of the original and the PS4 Pro refresh. I see your point Autumn & I understand why you & others like yourself who share that perspective would feel they way you do. For me though, I really didn't care aboot BC as I had played everything I wanted to play on PS3 & was ready to move on. In regards to Sony not including a UHD player on the Pro, I was a bit setback when they made the decision as well.

It is definitely not a preferred way to play but you can get an idea of the feel of the game and its good enough once you acclimate to the delay, one of my buds was having trouble with the final optional boss in God of War and I told him to pass me the controller as I wanted to see if I could do it (after putting in like 3 hours on it earlier that day for the trophy) and got it down to the last bar on the second time.

I wonder how this will work out. Electronic Arts shares will rise due to the success of its subscription gaming services, according to one Wall Street firm. Needham reiterated its buy rating for EA shares, saying its subscription business is already worth $3 billion to the company. ""We believe that EA is building a Netflix for video games,"" analyst Laura Martin said in a note to clients Friday. ""It is our view that millennials want to rent content (eg, Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu) rather than own it, and that content companies with data about what their consumers view/play/use create valuation upside from programming, eCommerce, and advertising revenue streams."" Martin raised her price target to $170 from $135 for EA shares, representing 19 percent upside from Thursday's close. The analyst noted the company announced a new, more expensive tier for its PC subscription gaming service called ""Origin Access Premier"" priced at $14.99 per month or $100 per year. The new tier enables consumers to play EA's biggest games as they are launched. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/buy...ilding-a-netflix-for-video-games-needham.html I only wish hat Ubisoft is doing it. ====================::==================== milliniar said: ↑ PlayStation now is closer to being Netflix as it has more than just so you games.

The impact to relationships between platform holders and 3rd parties: If a 3rd party has plans to make a remaster (Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, RE2, Metal Gear, Okami) then those plans are neutered by the BC offered by the platform holder. Where is the revenue coming in to offset these? It's not coming from the consumer that expects BC. It's not coming from 'good faith'. Those costs surely arnt high relative to how much money they would make by retaining a large player base and large volume of future sales. Arnt most games peer to peer? I don't think anyone is expecting them to support multiplayer forever if not. Publishers are going to be happy to have a larger player base to market new games to than anything else. If they want to re-release anything it's going to have to be a good effort and that's good for everyone tbh. How many people are going to be downloading patches for older games? That's going to tail off over the years. The costs here are over exaggerated IMO. As for the additional skus that was in a scenario where they introduced bespoke incompatible hardware.

Someone will crack the streaming code. What I think we might see is Ultra versions as download only on the Xbox Scarlet, while you can stream the lower graphic setting version on any device. I played PSNow and the games all ran well and was good enough for me. So I can imagine in 5 -10 years you will be able to stream games that today seem impossible. Then the really high end stuff you buy hardware and download it like gamepass.

The God of War games aren't difficult per se, but some of those challenges are downright annoying and frustrating. God of War 1 is the most difficult game in the franchise in my opinion, due to how you have to beat The Challenge of the Gods in one sitting. Anyone who has the platinum knows how much of a bitch Challenge 10 can be. Then you have to beat the game in under 5 hours, which is possible without the Cow outfit. Not easy though, and you don't get that outfit until you beat The Challenge of the Gods anyway. mmm, ok I gotta agree on God of War 1 and yes some are absolutely tedious annoying af. Although I probably was just stupid lucky on challange 10 as it didn't cost me too much time. Though if someone asks for easy platinums I assume they want to rush them and just go for trophies. 5 hours was very easy. If you played the game, finish the challanges and start immediatly after you probably still have it fresh in your mind where to go (and you can even pause the game and look on youtube where to go if you somehow got lost). I went with the cow outfit and was done in around 2.30hrs max and I'm skillwise definitely average on GoW 😝 When I played on Psnow trial I managed to squeeze in all god of wars + the first sly cooper. The fun part is I think I raged harder on sly then all GOW combined 😂",,Deluziion90,United States of America,,,Positive,Joy,Forums,,,,,PS Now easy platinums,,,

I am posting it again for you; I have been PC gaming for about 5 years now but decided to get an Xbox One X instead of a PS4 Pro recently (after the price of gpus became probitively expensive) for the following reasons: I already have a gaming PC that can access PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) via PSNow, so for me the Xbox One X was the supplemental console choice that I needed. The Xbox One X again is the best model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Gamepass subscription - allowing you to play the latest(and multiple) AAA games on launch with a reasonable and affordable subscription fee without having to pay $60 or more to buy each game. In contrast PSNow only has older PS3 and PS4 games. Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor The One X is also better than my PC right now on multi-platforms at least until I can upgrade my gpu Finally aside from those mentioned above many of which were added post launch, Microsoft is dedicated to adding even more features based on feedback from their customers, including Dolby Vision and support for the upcoming 2.1 HDMI standard and has been open to lending some of their iconic characters to Nintendo for use in their games. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting anti-consumer practices in their arrogance. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. Was sony murder your mom or something? You keep re post the same thing over and over again to discredit sony",,daeng_hary92,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

They all hate this gen, believe it or not. Not at all. The Xbox One X has restored the confidence of many Xbox fans and with the direction that Microsoft has taken in terms of acquiring 5 new studios to develop first party games, exclusives is not going to be an issue in the future as well. The fact is that even post launch Microsoft continues to add features to their console and has been very receptive to feedback from their customers as to which they want to add even more. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti-consumer practices in their arrogance.

But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. Not really confidence but has turned into a fantroll paradise that board is toxic. Actually I noticed that a lot of Sony fanboys have migrated to the Xbox One boards because it seems that the PS4 board has become obsessed with this SJW nonsense and because complaints about Sony not allowing their gamers to play with Switch owners, instead of talking about games. The only toxicity I noticed on the Xbox One boards is when the Sony fanboys invade those boards, and attack Xbox One owners in a disrespectful manner. I also notice them doing the same thing on the PC and Nintendo boards. Then your definitely looking at that board with some heavy blinders on. All you need to see is the fire storm that erupted on this board with TLOU 2 after E3. Basically every other post started was about that topic. Add to that the Fortnite controversy and it drove away PS4 fans who wanted to discuss just games. But that doesnt account for the consistent stream of fan troll crap topics that board has become. To even say thats its all from Sony fanboys is completely disingenuous. It is true though. Sony fanboys like starting topics there to rile Xbox owners. I also seem them on the PC and Nintendo boards as well.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

FireDrakeZ posted... peontom posted... No reason to voluntarily go into gaming purgatory. Have you seen the suffering on the xb1 board this gen? They all hate this gen, believe it or not. Not at all. The Xbox One X has restored the confidence of many Xbox fans and with the direction that Microsoft has taken in terms of acquiring 5 new studios to develop first party games, exclusives is not going to be an issue in the future as well. The fact is that even post launch Microsoft continues to add features to their console and has been very receptive to feedback from their customers as to which they want to add even more. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti-consumer practices in their arrogance. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. Not really confidence but has turned into a fantroll paradise that board is toxic. Actually I noticed that a lot of Sony fanboys have migrated to the Xbox One boards because it seems that the PS4 board has become obsessed with this SJW nonsense and because complaints about Sony not allowing their gamers to play with Switch owners, instead of talking about games. The only toxicity I noticed on the Xbox One boards is when the Sony fanboys invade those boards, and attack Xbox One owners in a disrespectful manner. I also notice them doing the same thing on the PC and Nintendo boards.

I wonder how this will work out. Electronic Arts shares will rise due to the success of its subscription gaming services, according to one Wall Street firm. Needham reiterated its buy rating for EA shares, saying its subscription business is already worth $3 billion to the company. ""We believe that EA is building a Netflix for video games,"" analyst Laura Martin said in a note to clients Friday. ""It is our view that millennials want to rent content (eg, Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu) rather than own it, and that content companies with data about what their consumers view/play/use create valuation upside from programming, eCommerce, and advertising revenue streams."" Martin raised her price target to $170 from $135 for EA shares, representing 19 percent upside from Thursday's close. The analyst noted the company announced a new, more expensive tier for its PC subscription gaming service called ""Origin Access Premier"" priced at $14.99 per month or $100 per year. The new tier enables consumers to play EA's biggest games as they are launched. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/buy...ilding-a-netflix-for-video-games-needham.html I only wish hat Ubisoft is doing it. ====================::==================== PlayStation now is closer to being Netflix as it has more than just sony games.",,milliniar,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA is ‘building a Netflix for video games’,,,

Sloane was throwing away some of the crafts she’d made weeks ago that were now ruined thanks to the storm. Glancing up at Jack, she was relieved and both annoyed at his presence. “Well, you’re an idiot.” She muttered before moving to wrap an arm around his neck and put him into a hug.

175056598862,6/19/2018,http://barbosaasouza.tumblr.com/post/175056598862,"PlayStation Now is a service that PS4 users can subscribe to that allows players to access various titles to stream at a flat rate each month. It offers several different games for you to blow through just like Xbox’s Game Pass service, but the catch is that you have to stream the games, which isn’t optimal for everyone. If you don’t have decent internet service, it can be a nightmare.

But it looks like Sony is doing a little something to alleviate that going forward. According to an industry source that confirmed the news to Kotaku UK, downloadable games are coming to PlayStation Now later this year, namely in September. It will be limited to PlayStation 4 titles for now, at least at first, but it will allow players to download titles they’d like to play later instead of having to stream them all.

You’ll be able to keep games you download much in the same way that PlayStation Plus titles become added to your collection. As long as you keep a PlayStation Now subscription, you can play them offline and at your leisure on your primary PS4, and with other accounts on the same system.

Kotaku UK reached out for further, official comment from Sony regarding the situation, but the company hasn’t replied just yet. If it does indeed end up happening, this could certainly make PlayStation Now more of a viable competitor to Xbox Game Pass, and it’s good news for Sony fans overall.

There are some potential aspects of cloud gaming that are appealing but as of now it's still a ways off to being acceptable to the masses. The internet infrastructure isn't there and the current subscription models out there are a mess. Pretty much this. To elaborate, cloud gaming is never going to work for certain genres. Specifically, games that are fast paced and/or rely on quick reactions. The subscription model can work, but publishers first have to swallow their pride offer a lot more for a lot less. Subscriptions on a per game basis will fail. They need to offer a quality library at about the price of Netlfix or Hulu subscription. Lastly there needs to be a means to 'buy' the game separately from the subscription, even if it is still streamed to the player. There are a lot of games I would grab off of PSNow of they had this option. I actually think there’s a pretty big difference between Netflix and video games. Tv shows and movies are a lot more disposable than video games. Compared to tv shows people tend to play fewer games for longer. There’s probably a niche for it but I think even assuming the streaming is flawless, that’s still,a pretty big barrier.",,meiyuki,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I personally don't have them but a lot of areas have some pretty tight caps. Cell infrastructure sucks in the US too or at least that's what they claim which is why they put very restrictive caps on us. You're lucky to have a wireless plan that gets 10-15GBs data on it a month. That's not a lot just doing even a little streaming in high resolutions. 4K would eat most of that data plan up in an hour. Landline is mostly restricted based on area. That's probably why Sony hasn't put much effort at all into promoting PSNow. It's a lost cause until US infrastructure can get their head out of their ass which we all know the US is a big market for it probably biggest. My state has a lot of red tape to go through when it tries to make more consumer-friendly practices when it comes to things like data caps. I'm lucky enough to have Charter as my ISP and they were forced to put certain obligations when they bought out TWC. One of them was they couldn't put data caps on us, they had to have at least 200mbps down in all markets and they couldn't throttle connections for any reason. We need tighter regulations on the ISPs/Cell providers because they're out of control. So in sense yes, they're restricting technology's capability here due to greed. Click to expand...

We're probably nearing the end of the PS4's prime by 2020 I believe, so another two good years of new games are likely before developers start with the phasing out, then focusing their energy towards a new console.

One reason Bethesda had such buggy games compared to the much less buggy 360 versions. I remember there was mention that the cell was more complicated to develop for.

FireDrakeZ posted... @OneTruePlayer81 I know. I was considering subscribing to PSNow for a month on my gaming PC to play PS3 and PS4 exclusives that I am interested in and then cancelling it. It doesn't include the latest games though. Gamepass on the other hand, includes the latest AAA games like State of Decay 2, Sea of Thieves, (as well as slightly older AAA games like Gears of War 4, Fallout 4, the Division, Rise of the Tomb Raider) at launch without having to pay the inflated launch prices for these games. And these games are downloaded and not subject to the vagaries of streaming that you find on PSNow. You can even access classic OGXBox games that are now back compatible and enhanced on Xbox One X like STAR WARS™ - Knights of the Old Republic™ on Gamepass. Yeah sorry, I didn't read your first post properly. Although I wouldn't count state of decay and sea of thieves as AAA tbh The point is that Gamepass will include many new games including Xbox exclusives that would normally cost you a lot to buy on launch and not just older games like on PSNow. With the 5 studios that Microsoft just added producing new games, and upcoming AAA staples like Gears 5, Halo Infinity and Forza Horizon 4, etc. coming in the near future, it would make that gaming subscription a very good deal indeed. https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass Would it not bother you guys if Microsoft's game pass subscription pushed the industry towards even more monetisation of games, even more ""games as service"", even more over-reaching with DRM? Genuine question. I'm not defending psnow(I don't partake). And I'm not saying this is an absolute. But judging by what microsoft wants with DRM and the monetization of first party games and subscription based services, it's hard to imagine that's not the overall intention.

175069719236,6/19/2018,http://cybmatt1.tumblr.com/post/175069719236,"PlayStation Now Will Let You Download PS4 Games This Year



PlayStation Now is a service that PS4 users can subscribe to that allows players to access various titles to stream at a flat rate each month. It offers several different games for you to blow through just like Xbox’s Game Pass service, but the catch is that you have to stream the games, which isn’t optimal for everyone. If you don’t have decent internet service, it can be a nightmare.

But it looks like Sony is doing a little something to alleviate that going forward. According to an industry source that confirmed the news to Kotaku UK, downloadable games are coming to PlayStation Now later this year, namely in September. It will be limited to PlayStation 4 titles for now, at least at first, but it will allow players to download titles they’d like to play later instead of having to stream them all.

You’ll be able to keep games you download much in the same way that PlayStation Plus titles become added to your collection. As long as you keep a PlayStation Now subscription, you can play them offline and at your leisure on your primary PS4, and with other accounts on the same system.

Kotaku UK reached out for further, official comment from Sony regarding the situation, but the company hasn’t replied just yet. If it does indeed end up happening, this could certainly make PlayStation Now more of a viable competitor to Xbox Game Pass, and it’s good news for Sony fans overall.

Little is known about the upcoming Navi chip, although it is thought that it will be based on 7 nanometre process technology, but will not be designed to compete in the high-end PC market; some journalists have even theorised that the architecture is being designed with the PS5 in mind.

In spite of being the largest brick-and-mortar games retailer in the U.S., GameStop has struggled to remain relevant in the wake of digital game sales and popular online retailers such as Amazon offering more competitive pricing and direct shipment to consumers. “There can be no assurance any agreement will result from these discussions,” the news release stated. “GameStop does not intend to make any additional comments regarding these discussions unless and until it is appropriate to do so.” While it is not yet certain if GameStop will follow through with a sale, the company’s stocks rose 11% on Monday, after rumors of a buyout started. GameStop reported a net loss of $105.9 million for the 2017 fiscal year, and with profits continuing to dwindle the company is in need of new direction to turn it around. GameStop’s push for pre-owned trade-ins and subsequent sales have kept the company afloat, and the retailer even expanded into used electronics sales, such as tablets. However, the options for consumers continue to grow, even when it comes to older titles with streaming services such as PlayStation Now and Microsoft’s upcoming service. The leadership of GameStop has also been in flux over the past year after J. Paul Raines resigned in November 2017 for health reasons, before his death in March. The next appointed CEO Michael Mauler resigned after only three months in May. Current interim CEO and former Microsoft exec, Shane Kim, took over June 1.",,Far-Queue,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I already have a gaming PC that can access PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) via PSNow, so for me the Xbox One X was the supplemental console choice that I needed. The Xbox One X again is the best model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor Handicapped accesible peripherals and controllers The One X is also better than my PC right now on multi-platforms at least until I can upgrade my gpu Finally aside from those mentioned above many of which were added post launch, Microsoft is dedicated to adding even more features based on feedback from their customers, including Dolby Vision and support for the upcoming 2.1 HDMI standard and has been open to lending some of their iconic characters to Nintendo for use in their games. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals.

You made this topic in the PS4 board and you got ripped apart. You have now made it in the Xbox board and are getting ripped apart lol. If you have a gaming pc why would you need an Xbox 1. All the games release for both so it is useless Yes I did and of course PS4 owners didn't like being told that there is such a big difference in disparity in terms of features, but I did not read one argument that will rebut the reasons I listed. It is fact and can't be disputed. Their only recourse was of course the exclusives that the PS4 has and I didn't dispute that advantage whatsoever.

This year, however, has been very quiet on the new tech front. This comes as no huge surprise from Nintendo, as the Switch was released only last year and is still basking in popularity – with new titles expected to be announced during Nintendo’s E3 presentation. The most anticipated of these being that Fortnite – the hugely popular co-op survival game that has until now been available for PC, Mac, Xbox One, PS4 and iOS – is finally available now for Switch as well. Sony was pretty hush-hush in terms of new gaming systems. It seems that Sony supposedly won’t have anything to offer in the way of consoles until 2021, at which point the reality of gaming consoles may not look as it does now. Microsoft went so far as to announce the new line of consoles that they have in development – nicknamed “Scarlett” – and the expected release date of 2020. This line of products has been described as a “family of devices”, although what that exactly entails is up for debate. Given that Microsoft strongly backs the cloud gaming initiative, it’s a safe bet to assume that if Scarlett is a set of separate devices or peripherals that it may be heavily cloud-based. Microsoft clearly sees a promising future in-game streaming – imagine playing the new Halo, and the only necessary hardware on your end being a screen, controller and network connection. Microsoft envisions a gaming reality where this may be the case, with no high-powered (and expensive) console required on the part of the user. This eliminates the need to buy a hardcopy version of the game, or even to download the game files. The games you purchase will reside in your game library on the cloud. This could potentially make playing high-end games more financially accessible, as well as changing the entire console market. PC gamers have similar game streaming services available to them as well. GeForce Now from Nvidia allows you to stream games that you have purchased through other digital stores such as Steam while doing all the heavy lifting on their networked processors. Blade’s Shadow streaming system gives you access to the computing power of a high-end Windows 10 PC on whichever device you may have. Other companies besides Microsoft are looking into what cloud gaming can offer. EA has demonstrated a trial of its game streaming service at E3 and even Google is developing a subscription-based game streaming service. Sony’s PlayStation Now has been successfully streaming PS2, PS3 and PS4 games to a variety of devices since 2014. With competitors focusing more on the cloud gaming front, Sony will also undoubtedly have plans to expand their streaming capabilities. Perhaps this is why they are holding out on releasing the PS5 for the moment, especially since comparatively the PS4 is still performing very well. Before game streaming can become a widespread thing, however, the infrastructure of our internet will have to advance quite drastically. Streaming a game’s visuals and audio is only part of the feat – maintaining a latency that will make the games playable is a far bigger issue. It is estimated that cloud gaming requires a speed of 20Mbps, with the average speed in the USA being 18.7Mbps and the average speed in the UK being 16.51Mbps. Given these numbers, it wouldn’t be feasible to roll out cloud gaming to the masses just yet. However, statistics show that these average speeds are increasing year by year. An ecological benefit from the potential trend of cloud-based games would be a significant cut-back in the resources used to create and ship the thousands of hardcopy games that are released each year. These technological leaps are a few years away, however, so no need to regret your new console purchase just yet. Neither Microsoft nor Sony are likely to do away with console systems altogether any time soon, with both developers planning at least one more generation of consoles. Whether they resemble what we know of gaming consoles today will remain to be seen.",,RedPanda4,,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

We are compiling games from their original, C++ native code, and porting them over into a new web framework so that they can be run inside a browser on a blank HTML page, and it runs as if it were a local game installed on your PC.

It doesn't need it and I would personally say that it shouldn't even be considered during the design phase of a new console. If after the console design has been finalised and a prototype built the thing is capable of being backwards compatible the yeah, add that feature, but that designer he console from the off as being backwards compatible would stifle creativity and result in weaker future consoles. Let's say Sony has two choices of CPU, one of them has a significant clock speed advantage over the other but only has 6 cores rather than 8. This CPU would struggle to run PS4 games natively because it can't run the number of concurrent threads the PS4 does. This means this theoretical PS5 has to choose the weaker CPU to give backwards compatibility and we miss out on superior next gen games. Then take the same argument to the RAM, the GPU, the baseline architecture etc. Leveraging PSNow correctly solves that problem. More data centers and the ability to use your disc to grant access to the games you already own for free would allow for the backwards compatibility that people crave while giving Sony full choice to go for the very best components to build the best possible console.",,-Murton-,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I wonder how this will work out. Electronic Arts shares will rise due to the success of its subscription gaming services, according to one Wall Street firm. Needham reiterated its buy rating for EA shares, saying its subscription business is already worth $3 billion to the company. ""We believe that EA is building a Netflix for video games,"" analyst Laura Martin said in a note to clients Friday. ""It is our view that millennials want to rent content (eg, Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu) rather than own it, and that content companies with data about what their consumers view/play/use create valuation upside from programming, eCommerce, and advertising revenue streams."" Martin raised her price target to $170 from $135 for EA shares, representing 19 percent upside from Thursday's close. The analyst noted the company announced a new, more expensive tier for its PC subscription gaming service called ""Origin Access Premier"" priced at $14.99 per month or $100 per year. The new tier enables consumers to play EA's biggest games as they are launched. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/buy...ilding-a-netflix-for-video-games-needham.html I only wish hat Ubisoft is doing it. ====================::==================== HereticBD said: ↑ Streaming games on a subscription based format is definitely the future. Once the bandwidth speeds catch up proper, and the data usage isn't an issue, it's gonna be commonplace. ""Playstation Now"" was a little ahead of it's time. I used it for a month though, and it was pretty impressive for the most part. Once the kinks are all ironed out, and the games have no difference from their retail counterparts, it's a slam dunk for the industry. You'll pony up $20 or $30 a month to play whatever you want, and will totally accept that you no longer own anything. Click to expand... This. EA is reading the tea leaves. Anyone who is rational can see this. Why? We've seen it happen, now, twice , in the two other major entertainment media: (1) Music (2) Movies It isn't a coincidence that they happened in this order. It's directly correlated to bandwidth. Streaming was able to handle music first, then movies. Books would have predated music, but they didn't have a widespread electronic form. What do we have, now? Spotify, Pandora, and the rest for music. We have Netflix, Hulu, and the rest for movies. The major tech players-- Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft-- have presence in both worlds. Amazon Prime is becoming a glorified cloud rental service for books. Video games are by far the most bandwidth-intensive of all media. They're last. It's going to be much more difficult, considering the physical limitations, but the truth is the consumer market hasn't demonstrated much of an appetite for 4K (or VR/AR), so the next phase is bringing 1080p to streaming. The It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World spec race is finally over. There's a reason we all got sick of those, ""To the cloud!"" commercials a decade ago. The business world isn't stupid. They knew where things were headed. Fortunately, we got some pretty hilarious Taco episodes out of it via The League .",,Madmick,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA is ‘building a Netflix for video games’,,,

Microsoft also has many years experience with cloud technology and Azure server investment that is really only bested by Amazon (AWS), which Microsoft is slowly closing the gap on. As for PlayStation Now. The input lag was very noticeable. I played The Last of Us and the experience just wasn't that great. Playing a competitive fighting game or a shooter would be unplayable. It also looked very dark and the image quality is obviously compressed. EA is also going to get into a streaming service too I believe so we'll see how far advanced each are because to me it looks like Sony is not investing at all into PlayStation Now and hardly ever talks about it. In case you're wondering my speeds are 100Mb/s down and 10Mb/s up. Way higher than the recommended 5Mb/s speed. I think its simple. Either you stream the lower fidelity version, or you download the full 4K bells and whistle version. If you stream you can do it to any device, but for the better graphics and lower latency you need the next XBOX. Imagine gamepass but now you can stream to any device but its at 720P lower quality settings. For some people that would be good enough especially for lower level games (non mulitplayer/shooters/racing games). It would be pretty awesome if you could play Forza 4 at home, then pull it up on your phone and finish the level by streaming and then play it at work on you 10 year old PC.",,cryptoadam,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

So what? I literally just told you what. The game's difficulty lies pretty much solely in it's control scheme. Take that away and you have a stupidly simple action game. It is not like REMake where you can make the game a little simpler while still maintaining a lot of what made the original games challenging. It would make the games a complete cake walk. And like I said before, a game with tank controls is not going to have enough mainstream appeal to even warrant a remake/remaster. Best you could hope for is if the games show up on Playstation Now. Once again, so what? I'm playing the game for its story, not its difficulty. Key word: I'm. You might want it, but it isn't going to have mainstream appeal. That is just the hard truth, it is why the game series as a whole hasn't even broken the 8 million sales mark despite having 7 games (4 of them main series). Capcom isn't going to do it if they can't guarantee at least 1 million sales, and there is no way it is going to even come close to that. I dont think it would have any less mainstream appeal than nioh. I really dont see why you think it would be so hard to change the mechanics up a bit for a new onimusha game. It's been done with plenty of other series. Not to mention, hack and slash are pretty much all stupidly easy anyway barring something like ninja gaiden on master difficulty",,OhhhJa,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Origin Access, while a more limited catalog gives you full unrestricted access to the catalog as if you had purchased the game yourself. I can't comment on an annual purchase, but for a few months at a time depending on what you're interested in it certainly doesn't seem like bad value. PSNow on the other hand still only offers streaming gameplay that's based off original hardware. Games aren't going to look or perform any better than they did on their respective console and there will be around 60ms-125ms of latency constantly which can be pretty bad on any games that require accurate precision (fighting games, some sports titles etc.)",,Westify1,United States of America,,,Negative,Unclassified,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Last generation, I preferred the 360 controller by a wide margin. There was just something ""off"" about the PS3 controller. It always felt a bit too small and too light. Maybe it was all in my mind, but I feel completely different about the PS4 controller. It's a bit more weighty and fits well with my hands. The first time I held it I was like,""woah wtf I like how this feels."" I love it. I also own the X and PS4 Pro, and if you don't have a PS4 already, just get the PS4 Pro. I love my X. I'm replaying games I beat just for the higher framerates and it's like night and day. Look at the opening level of Tomb Raider on a regular Xbox and then on the X and tell me you don't see the difference. It's big. But if you don't own a Playstation, now is the time to buy one.

Someone will crack the streaming code. What I think we might see is Ultra versions as download only on the Xbox Scarlet, while you can stream the lower graphic setting version on any device. I played PSNow and the games all ran well and was good enough for me. So I can imagine in 5 -10 years you will be able to stream games that today seem impossible. Then the really high end stuff you buy hardware and download it like gamepass. Now what will eventually happen like Netflix, is 3rd parties will create their own services and pull content from MS/Sony. Getting rid of latency is going to always be an issue though. There is simply no way to get latency down to the levels that can rival that of the TV being connected directly to the console.",,JohnnyFootball,United States of America,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,

Makes sense since there's no emulator as of yet for PS3. They also are saying you can only download 4 titles at a time. ====================::==================== deuce985 said: ↑ firesq4014 said: ↑ deuce985 said: ↑ Exactly that's why they do it. I don't buy $59.99 or $399.99 consoles from Microsoft but rather get a cheap pass to play whatever I want. Sony should do the same thing so I can get rid of my Playstation and just play games on my PC. Click to expand... I get what you are saying and for those who would rather play on pc I guess that would be the perfect scenario. However, and I don't pretend to understand much about tech (I'm more old school as I was out of college before computers really started hitting homes), but like stated pc is MS. Not Sony. Maybe if sony had an os that came standard on just about every pc it could make more sense. MS doesn't care if you play on xbox or pc because they are getting all your money one way or the other. I can't see MS affording Sony that if they need to use a windows platform. Click to expand... They already have remote play that can be installed on other devices. It's extremely limited though. What they need to do is take something like PSNow and make it public knowledge you can use it on any device while simply connecting something like a DS4 to your tablet device to play anywhere you want. Currently, not many people know about remote play because Sony does not promote it. In order for it to work you need to have your PS4 connected to the internet. You also have to use third-party apps in order to get it working on devices like iOS tablets. It has an app for PC I use it. Why does it need all that trouble? There's plenty of quality of life improvements they can make it that can possibly turn it into a huge streaming service similar to Netflix for games. It would be especially attractive for people who already own consoles and just want to play something somewhere else without needing to carry their console around with them. Secondly, you dig into a market that's always on the fence due to your expensive hardware and you could even dent the used games/rental market. It seems like a very smart investment to me because in the modern world mobile technology is where everything is going anyway. I have a tablet with me everywhere I go with my smartphone. The download option is LONG overdue. This should've been implemented years ago. Only major hurdle I could see on pushing something like this across many devices would you'd need to be exclusively streaming due to hardware limitations and not enough storage to download a game.

I feel Sony wouldn’t have invested in the infrastructure for streaming if they didn’t really plan to make use of it outside of a console.",,sean9986,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,PSN Now to allow downloads starting in September,,,

You're lucky to have a wireless plan that gets 10-15GBs data on it a month. That's not a lot just doing even a little streaming in high resolutions. 4K would eat most of that data plan up in an hour. Landline is mostly restricted based on area. That's probably why Sony hasn't put much effort at all into promoting PSNow. It's a lost cause until US infrastructure can get their head out of their ass which we all know the US is a big market for it probably biggest. My state has a lot of red tape to go through when it tries to make more consumer-friendly practices when it comes to things like data caps. I'm lucky enough to have Charter as my ISP and they were forced to put certain obligations when they bought out TWC. One of them was they couldn't put data caps on us, they had to have at least 200mbps down in all markets and they couldn't throttle connections for any reason.

In the week leading up to E3, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot predicted that there may be just one more generation of console hardware before streaming becomes the ubiquitous platform for games of all kinds. ""There will be one more console generation and then after that, we will be streaming,"" he said. ""All of us."" This thread was also picked up by EA CEO Andrew Wilson , who used the E3 stage to speak directly to the growing influence of streaming and subscriptions on how the company thinks about its future. When Xbox head Phil Spencer revealed that Microsoft was actually developing a streaming platform (possibly as a replacement for the download-based Xbox Game Pass), E3 2018 suddenly became about so much more than which games will be released in the next 12 months. Ultimately, these far-reaching ideas tainted the view of Sony's more restrained briefing, which contained barely a word about its plans for PlayStation Now. Instead, Sony used its position of strength in the market to focus on a handful of big games - a strategy that left many (both in the room and watching from afar) feeling underwhelmed. ""It is possible that a few years from now Microsoft will be the Netflix of gaming and Sony more like HBO"" Joost van Dreunen ""With an install base of 75 million that makes sense for now,"" says Joost van Dreunen, CEO and co-founder of SuperData Research. ""But it does not provide an answer to the question what the future holds. Worse, it is inconsistent with the direction senior management recently revealed - plans to focus on subscription revenue from online gaming and streaming music and video."" Where Microsoft surpassed Sony is in doing both: showing a slate of 50 games (most of them not exclusive, it should be noted) and doubling its first-party studio roster, while also improving Xbox Game Pass and indicating that streaming will be the next step. ""In particular, this last part is promising,"" van Dreunen says. ""Although Microsoft has failed to win the centre of the living room as it originally set out to do, it is setting itself up to become the leader in the digital games market by equally amassing content and focusing on distribution rollout. It is possible that a few years from now Microsoft will be the Netflix of gaming and Sony more like HBO. ""But a digital future is about scale and infrastructure, which means that Microsoft may yet claim the centre."" via https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articl...om-playstation",,wraggster,United Kingdom,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Streaming could be key to Xbox reclaiming the lead from PlayStation,,,

Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform .

In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy.

Similar to Netflix's download feature, if you have an active PlayStation Now subscription you'll be able to download titles directly to your primary PlayStation and then play them offline. Kotaku says other accounts on the PlayStation will also be able to use the content. Continue reading… Continue reading...",,VUBot,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

In case you're wondering my speeds are 100Mb/s down and 10Mb/s up. Way higher than the recommended 5Mb/s speed. What service does MS have like PSNOW? Zilch, nada...So talking up Azure is something I've seen since MS made their pitch in 2013. Azure Servers, power of the cloud to boost XBOX-ONE games, Crackdown would be the first game to show us that power way back in 2013 and all MS first party games would follow with unlimited capacity from there on, just a seething source of power from the cloud et al.....Snaps fingers! The generation is almost over, people are still talking the virtues of Azure et al. So many leeching on the words of MS as if they are gospel. PSNOW is a functional service under Gaikai and Onlive technology, Sony has the upperhand in that realm and will no doubt up the ante for next gen or perhaps develop something even more impressive. The Gaikai guys have not been twiddling their thumbs all this time. Talking about Azure and POTC is like saying in the absence of a proper streaming service or any POTC game is like saying, there's this guy in your hood which could cream Michael Jordan or Usain Bolt at their peak, it's such wishful thinking and useless rhetoric......It's either you doing it or you aren't, this is the real world....",,thelastword,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I wonder how this will work out. Electronic Arts shares will rise due to the success of its subscription gaming services, according to one Wall Street firm. Needham reiterated its buy rating for EA shares, saying its subscription business is already worth $3 billion to the company. ""We believe that EA is building a Netflix for video games,"" analyst Laura Martin said in a note to clients Friday. ""It is our view that millennials want to rent content (eg, Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu) rather than own it, and that content companies with data about what their consumers view/play/use create valuation upside from programming, eCommerce, and advertising revenue streams."" Martin raised her price target to $170 from $135 for EA shares, representing 19 percent upside from Thursday's close. The analyst noted the company announced a new, more expensive tier for its PC subscription gaming service called ""Origin Access Premier"" priced at $14.99 per month or $100 per year. The new tier enables consumers to play EA's biggest games as they are launched. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/buy...ilding-a-netflix-for-video-games-needham.html I only wish hat Ubisoft is doing it. ====================::==================== PlayStation now is closer to being Netflix as it has more than just so you games.",,milliniar,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA is ‘building a Netflix for video games’,,,

So you'd have to have a PSnow sub either way, but would have to pay for an upgrade (like adding showtime, or removing adds from Spotify) to play ""Playstation Hits"" if you didn't have an old disc.",,dab1294,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

TTT2 definitely has higher input lag than T7 though, and I did track down some numbers and it's at least 1 or 2 frames higher than PS4 T7's after the patch, which sucks for going back to TTT2. =/ Would be cool if Bamco officially rereleases it on PS4 or PS5 (not just PSNow, and obviously it would be more likely on the PS5 at this point), with better netcode and the excuse for more people to make it active again. I suppose they could boost or upscale the resolution to full 1080p while they're at it (pls don't make it stutter like TTT1 HD...). As far as Revolution went, aside from stats, invincibles, and the whole paywall framework (including being encouraged to pay for character unlocks or for simplified outfit options), for a solo game it probably was more like what I've always loved about the series, since without juggle extenders and oki relaunches its pacing was once again like T3 and T5. And for a mainstream casual audience, simplification and fully appealing play is necessary. Tekken currently gets less and less appealing for many non-hardcore fans the longer they're bounced around in extended juggles; they don't care about the damage, just how often they don't have active player agency. I feel llike T8 has to simplify itself down even further if it really wants to reclaim mainstream appeal. It is possible to do that while retaining technicality and higher-level complexity, but focusing on ways to keep evolving the juggling system into more and more complex territory isn't the answer.",,Spoofer,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

 [ad_1]



Sony might have an ace up its sleeve in the fight against Microsoft’s successful new Xbox Game Pass program. The strategy? Sony might offer downloadable titles via its PlayStation Now game-streaming service.

It’s all just a rumor from an insider source at the moment, but a new report says that offline downloads for some PlayStation Now games could start as early as September of this year.

FireDrakeZ posted... oboro9 posted... FireDrakeZ posted... peontom posted... No reason to voluntarily go into gaming purgatory. Have you seen the suffering on the xb1 board this gen? They all hate this gen, believe it or not. Not at all. The Xbox One X has restored the confidence of many Xbox fans and with the direction that Microsoft has taken in terms of acquiring 5 new studios to develop first party games, exclusives is not going to be an issue in the future as well. The fact is that even post launch Microsoft continues to add features to their console and has been very receptive to feedback from their customers as to which they want to add even more. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti-consumer practices in their arrogance. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. Not really confidence but has turned into a fantroll paradise that board is toxic. Actually I noticed that a lot of Sony fanboys have migrated to the Xbox One boards because it seems that the PS4 board has become obsessed with this SJW nonsense and because complaints about Sony not allowing their gamers to play with Switch owners, instead of talking about games. The only toxicity I noticed on the Xbox One boards is when the Sony fanboys invade those boards, and attack Xbox One owners in a disrespectful manner. I also notice them doing the same thing on the PC and Nintendo boards. Then your definitely looking at that board with some heavy blinders on. All you need to see is the fire storm that erupted on this board with TLOU 2 after E3. Basically every other post started was about that topic. Add to that the Fortnite controversy and it drove away PS4 fans who wanted to discuss just games. But that doesnt account for the consistent stream of fan troll crap topics that board has become. To even say thats its all from Sony fanboys is completely disingenuous.",,oboro9,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

The whole mid-cycle PS4 Pro/XB1X upgrade really threw me off with the generation cycle. So once the PS5 launches, will the Pro be considered the lower end of the new generation?

Or will they shift completely to the ps5 and forget about the Pro stuff? if they were smart they make it so it will run on ps4 to ps5 .only different would be ps5 runs it better Maybe ""smart"" for other folks, but it'd be one of the easiest ways to make me not buy your console. If it isn't a definitive generation and is instead a fluid generation, I will not have any interest and just stick with my older systems.

The Xbox One X again is the best model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform.

In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy.

GameStop is in talks with private firms about a potential buyout, the retailer confirmed in a news release.

In spite of being the largest brick-and-mortar games retailer in the U.S., GameStop has struggled to remain relevant in the wake of digital game sales and popular online retailers such as Amazon offering more competitive pricing and direct shipment to consumers.

“There can be no assurance any agreement will result from these discussions,” the news release stated. “GameStop does not intend to make any additional comments regarding these discussions unless and until it is appropriate to do so.”

While it is not yet certain if GameStop will follow through with a sale, the company’s stocks rose 11% on Monday, after rumors of a buyout started.

GameStop reported a net loss of $105.9 million for the 2017 fiscal year, and with profits continuing to dwindle the company is in need of new direction to turn it around.

GameStop’s push for pre-owned trade-ins and subsequent sales have kept the company afloat, and the retailer even expanded into used electronics sales, such as tablets. However, the options for consumers continue to grow, even when it comes to older titles with streaming services such as PlayStation Now and Microsoft’s upcoming service.

The leadership of GameStop has also been in flux over the past year after J. Paul Raines resigned in November 2017 for health reasons, before his death in March. The next appointed CEO Michael Mauler resigned after only three months in May. Current interim CEO and former Microsoft exec, Shane Kim, took over June 1.

We have two gamestops here - one of them is absolutely awful. Nice people, but the system is TERRIBLY broken so they can only do so much.

They rarely get any new stock that’s not video games (understandable, but should I still be seeing Ragnarok funkos on the shelves? NO), and the shirts are terribly over priced (I’m still waiting on a certain shirt to go on clearance) Hell, even clearance doesn’t clear things out!

I preordered a funko from them (Though to be fair, it wasn’t labeled on the list properly, as ECCC Exclusive 1 and 2, so I had to guess), and they just never got any of them in, so I had to go to the other one to get what I wanted.

Also; Their PoS system sucks.

I hope this straightens them up - and maybe pays them a bit better for all the shit they have to put up with.",,the-wolfbats,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,Confirmed: GameStop in Buyout Talks,Reblog,,

MS have the finances, sure. The experience though? Not so much. Xbox Live is still a better online service. Microsoft also has many years experience with cloud technology and Azure server investment that is really only bested by Amazon (AWS), which Microsoft is slowly closing the gap on. As for PlayStation Now. The input lag was very noticeable. I played The Last of Us and the experience just wasn't that great. Playing a competitive fighting game or a shooter would be unplayable. It also looked very dark and the image quality is obviously compressed. EA is also going to get into a streaming service too I believe so we'll see how far advanced each are because to me it looks like Sony is not investing at all into PlayStation Now and hardly ever talks about it. In case you're wondering my speeds are 100Mb/s down and 10Mb/s up. Way higher than the recommended 5Mb/s speed.",,Louis Cyphre,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,M,,,,,,,

This guy is trolling, he doesn't even own the damn game ffs!!!! and he's complaining about a sale wtf, this smells like shi**y clickbait trash. Second get it through your skull nobody cares if the game sold poorly on PC, heck it was expected because this is the 2nd Ni no Kuni and the first one was never released on PC (BIG MISTAKE) if the 1st was released on PC many people would had been interested in this one from the get go, plus PC ain't the only platform this game was released on, the MAIN ONE was PS4, uh hello Ni no Kuni 1 was released on PS3 only so it's obvious that the main playerbase is in Playstation. Now if the game sold poorly like you said and they're dropping the price because of it, I think is a brilliant idea, let's get those numbers up and show appreciation for porting the game by buying it, it's genius!. (Just buy it if you're interested if not shut up and stop your stupid discussion that is getting nowhere unless of course you already played it because you pirated it and then you came here to complain about sales when you don't even own it, if true then it makes sense that you're just a troll then.)",,a.j,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,"-40% off and it's been 3 months since it released, lmao",,,

175081904469,6/20/2018,http://thenewsguy.tumblr.com/post/175081904469,"Sony might have an ace up its sleeve in the fight against Microsoft’s successful new Xbox Game Pass program. The strategy? Sony might offer downloadable titles via its PlayStation Now game-streaming service.

It’s all just a rumor from an insider source at the moment, but a new report says that offline downloads for some PlayStation Now games could start as early as September of this year.

According to a source speaking with Kotaku UK, it will start exclusively with PS4 titles which means older PS3 games likely won’t be available to play offline right out of the gate. 

Offline games will continue to work as long as you have an active PlayStation Now account and they’ll be playable using your account on your PS4 and any account that also lives on that PS4 as well.

Sony has yet to corroborate the information in Kotaku’s report, but the move would make a lot of sense considering the success of the Xbox Game Pass. 

Either way, we’ll find out more in September.

Let me share my views on it. First, streaming still sucks big time! When PSnow launched I subscribed for a free 7 day trial. I had never played the last of us and it seemed 7 days would be enough to do a playtrough on the game. I had a beefy pc with 200mb wired network. The experience was so bad I didn't get past the first chapter. After that I picked up a used ps3 with the game and it was so much better! I played the whole game and it actually looked and felt like a different game! Next, current consoles and generations are holding back gaming. Games and more importantly game engines are developed with the lowest common denominator in mind, and that is the 1.8tf consoles. Take far cry 5 for example. It runs on an engine that is developed for the consoles. O a beefy pc it can scale in the quality of the assets (mostly textures) and the quality of post processing effects and pipeline as well as resolution and framerate. But the core gaming experience, physics and ai are the same on all systems and the game is not what it could be in 2018 because it is created on an engine that has to run on a 2013 hardware console.

This kind of ludicrous nonsense is right up there with releasing the PS4 Pro without a UHD player. Even the base ($299) XBone S has one. All that considered, the PS4 is a fantastic console which I have been quite happy with but Sony made some seriously poor decisions during the creation of the original and the PS4 Pro refresh. I see your point Autumn & I understand why you & others like yourself who share that perspective would feel the way you do. For me though, I really didn't care aboot BC as I had played everything I wanted to play on PS3 & was ready to move on. In regards to Sony not including a UHD player on the Pro, I was a bit setback when they made the decision as well. Seemed like a no-brainer to me to include that function even though I have dedicated UHD players for film watching. Just my perspective, regardless of what Sony does with PS5, I know that we will be looking forward to this game.",,Omegaice,United States of America,California,San Diego,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I wonder how this will work out. Electronic Arts shares will rise due to the success of its subscription gaming services, according to one Wall Street firm. Needham reiterated its buy rating for EA shares, saying its subscription business is already worth $3 billion to the company. ""We believe that EA is building a Netflix for video games,"" analyst Laura Martin said in a note to clients Friday. ""It is our view that millennials want to rent content (eg, Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, Hulu) rather than own it, and that content companies with data about what their consumers view/play/use create valuation upside from programming, eCommerce, and advertising revenue streams."" Martin raised her price target to $170 from $135 for EA shares, representing 19 percent upside from Thursday's close. The analyst noted the company announced a new, more expensive tier for its PC subscription gaming service called ""Origin Access Premier"" priced at $14.99 per month or $100 per year. The new tier enables consumers to play EA's biggest games as they are launched. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/buy...ilding-a-netflix-for-video-games-needham.html I only wish hat Ubisoft is doing it. ====================::==================== Streaming games on a subscription based format is definitely the future. Once the bandwidth speeds catch up proper, and the data usage isn't an issue, it's gonna be commonplace. ""Playstation Now"" was a little ahead of it's time. I used it for a month though, and it was pretty impressive for the most part. Once the kinks are all ironed out, and the games have no difference from their retail counterparts, it's a slam dunk for the industry. You'll pony up $20 or $30 a month to play whatever you want, and will totally accept that you no longer own anything.",,HereticBD,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,EA is ‘building a Netflix for video games’,,,

5620f8ac-655f-47b9-970f-7369769dbed8,6/26/2018,http://www.walb.com/story/38524087/everything-we-know-about-the-next-xbox-console,"By Gabe Gurwin Content Provided by Les Shu/Digital Trends It has been nearly five years since the launch of the Xbox One, and the console has changed significantly over that time with the discontinuation of Kinect, full redesign of the Xbox One S, and major enhancements of the Xbox One X . But revisions like these can only get a console so far, and it has us thinking about what comes next. Here is everything we know about the next Xbox console. It’s currently being designed During Microsoft’s E3 2018 presentation, head of Xbox Phil Spencer revealed that Microsoft is currently designing the architecture for the next generation of Xbox consoles. The team working on the project is the same one behind the Xbox One X. Curiously, Spencer said “consoles” rather than “console” when announcing this news during the conference. We’ve heard reports that Microsoft could be planning more than one console, possibly in an attempt to capitalize on both casual and hardcore players. It will likely feature game streaming Les Shu/Digital Trends Sony’s PlayStation Now subscription service allows PlayStation 4 users to stream games from the cloud instead of buying and downloading them outright, and in Japan, the Nintendo Switch has even flirted with this for Resident Evil 7 . No such service exists on the Xbox One, but during Microsoft’s E3 2018 presentation, Phil Spencer revealed that his team is currently developing cloud gaming technology that will allow you to play console-quality titles from several devices. It goes without saying that the next Xbox will be one of the supported systems, and this service could save players money if they want to try a game for a few hours before purchasing it. However, it’s very unlikely that the next Xbox will drop support for discs. The Xbox One S and X are the only two consoles on the market that support 4K Blu-ray discs, and with internet speeds still slow in much of the United States, physical games still serve a purpose. It will likely be backward compatible The Xbox One introduced backward compatibility with Xbox 360 games a few years ago, and it eventually added backward compatibility with original Xbox games, as well. It appears this will continue with the next generation of Xbox, though what form this will take remains unclear. Speaking to Eurogamer , Phil Spencer said he is “very proud of [Xbox’s] track record of compatibility” and that he wants to respect players’ previous purchases. Nothing concrete was revealed, but this certainly makes it sound like Xbox One games will be supported on the next Xbox. Virtual reality won’t become reality Mike Nichols, Microsoft’s Chief Marketing Officer for Xbox, squashed the rumors about virtual reality support by telling Gameindustry.biz that “We don’t have any plans specific to Xbox” for VR, or even mixed reality. The “specific to Xbox” phrase could give Microsoft an out, since it’s possible the company could bring over technology from Windows. Still, that seems like a long shot, because Microsoft has struggled there, too. The hardware will be similar, but quicker There’s no firm rumors about what will be in next Xbox, but there’s also not many options. Both Microsoft and Sony turned to using x86-based processors, like those found in PCs, with the latest console generation. They also turned to using AMD to build graphics. Both those solutions remains the most sensible, so it’s unlikely we’ll see anything different in the next Xbox. That said, the follow-up will of course be more powerful than the Xbox One X. The architecture of the current Xbox One and Xbox One X suggest the company has many opportunities for improvement. It could increase the CPU core count, change the CPU architecture, or upgrade to a new GPU architecture, like AMD’s Vega or perhaps even Navi, which isn’t yet in production but is on AMD’s roadmap. It’s codenamed ‘Scarlett’ and it’s two years away According to Thurrott’s Brad Sams , the next Xbox consoles are being codenamed “Scarlett,” similar to how the Xbox One X was referred to as “Project Scorpio” before its final name was revealed. The same report claimed the systems are planned for release in 2020, which would fall in line with Microsoft’s general timeline for hardware launches. The Xbox 360 was followed by the Xbox One eight years later, but that was an unusually long time for a console generation. Given the relatively low sales numbers for the Xbox One since its launch, expediting this process seems likely.

Have you seen the suffering on the xb1 board this gen? They all hate this gen, believe it or not. Not at all. The Xbox One X has restored the confidence of many Xbox fans and with the direction that Microsoft has taken in terms of acquiring 5 new studios to develop first party games, exclusives is not going to be an issue in the future as well. The fact is that even post launch Microsoft continues to add features to their console and has been very receptive to feedback from their customers as to which they want to add even more. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti-consumer practices in their arrogance. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

No, I meant this: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/micro ... 0-6421896/ Quote: Microsoft researchers have released a report that presents DeLorean, a cloud gaming solution that hides latency by trying to predict what you'll do next. According to the report (via TechCrunch) DeLorean's ""speculative execution system,"" as Microsoft calls it, is able to mask up to 250ms of network latency by rendering frames of future possible outcomes and sending them ahead of time. Essentially, based on your historical tendencies and recent behavior, DeLorean tries to predict your actions, render them, and send them to your device in advance to improve your perception that the game is more responsive. For actions that are harder to predict, DeLorean queues up multiple possible outcomes and displays only the correct one. This, the researchers say, produces an experience that is more responsive than current solutions, where even 100ms can feel laggy. Microsoft tested DeLorean with two games: Doom 3 and Fable 3. ""Through user studies and performance benchmarks, we find that players overwhelmingly prefer DeLorean to traditional thin-client gaming,"" they said, adding that ""DeLorean successfully mimics playing across a low-latency network."" However, while Microsoft says that they're able to reduce the added bandwidth of having to transmit possible outcome frames with better video compression, DeLorean still requires almost five times as much bandwidth than standard cloud gaming systems. So it's not ready for public consumption, but it is an interesting, possible solution to the latency problem. Sony's cloud gaming solution, PlayStation Now (which is based on Gaikai's technology), is currently in beta. It's an article from 2014 and we haven't heard anything about it since so my guess is that technology never really pulled through. Most likely because: - The system can't possibly guess right all the time so you probably get some very ugly latency spikes when it fails, most likely right at a critical part of the action. - The system needs to render a shit ton of frames that will never be used making it very inefficient for low graphic games and utterly ridiculous for high end games. - The system then needs to push all those redundant guesses to the client massively increasing the required bandwidth.",,Vlip,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

You are still part of their ecosystem. Click to expand... Exactly that's why they do it. I don't buy $59.99 or $399.99 consoles from Microsoft but rather get a cheap pass to play whatever I want. Sony should do the same thing so I can get rid of my Playstation and just play games on my PC. Click to expand... I get what you are saying and for those who would rather play on pc I guess that would be the perfect scenario. However, and I don't pretend to understand much about tech (I'm more old school as I was out of college before computers really started hitting homes), but like stated pc is MS. Not Sony. Maybe if sony had an os that came standard on just about every pc it could make more sense. MS doesn't care if you play on xbox or pc because they are getting all your money one way or the other. I can't see MS affording Sony that if they need to use a windows platform. Click to expand... They already have remote play that can be installed on other devices. It's extremely limited though. What they need to do is take something like PSNow and make it public knowledge you can use it on any device while simply connecting something like a DS4 to your tablet device to play anywhere you want. Currently, not many people know about remote play because Sony does not promote it. In order for it to work you need to have your PS4 connected to the internet. You also have to use third-party apps in order to get it working on devices like iOS tablets. It has an app for PC I use it. Why does it need all that trouble? There's plenty of quality of life improvements they can make it that can possibly turn it into a huge streaming service similar to Netflix for games. It would be especially attractive for people who already own consoles and just want to play something somewhere else without needing to carry their console around with them. Secondly, you dig into a market that's always on the fence due to your expensive hardware and you could even dent the used games/rental market. It seems like a very smart investment to me because in the modern world mobile technology is where everything is going anyway. I have a tablet with me everywhere I go with my smartphone. The download option is LONG overdue. This should've been implemented years ago. Only major hurdle I could see on pushing something like this across many devices would you'd need to be exclusively streaming due to hardware limitations and not enough storage to download a game.",,deuce985,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I was considering subscribing to PSNow for a month on my gaming PC to play PS3 and PS4 exclusives that I am interested in and then cancelling it. It doesn't include the latest games though. Gamepass on the other hand, includes the latest AAA games like State of Decay 2, Sea of Thieves, (as well as slightly older AAA games like Gears of War 4, Fallout 4, the Division, Rise of the Tomb Raider) at launch without having to pay the inflated launch prices for these games. And these games are downloaded and not subject to the vagaries of streaming that you find on PSNow. You can even access classic OGXBox games that are now back compatible and enhanced on Xbox One X like STAR WARS™ - Knights of the Old Republic™ on Gamepass. Yeah sorry, I didn't read your first post properly. Although I wouldn't count state of decay and sea of thieves as AAA tbh The point is that Gamepass will include many new games including Xbox exclusives that would normally cost you a lot to buy on launch and not just older games like on PSNow. With the 5 studios that Microsoft just added producing new games, and upcoming AAA staples like Gears 5, Halo Infinity and Forza Horizon 4, etc. coming in the near future, it would make that gaming subscription a very good deal indeed. https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

The Xbox One X again is the best console model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Gamepass - best and most affordable subscription program for a new console owner with access to the latest games right off the bat EA Access - for some reason Sony didn't allow EA to add this app to access the EA game library for the PS4 Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor The One X is also better than my PC right now on multi-platforms at least until I can upgrade my gpu Finally aside from those mentioned above many of which were added post launch, Microsoft is dedicated to adding even more features based on feedback from their customers, including Dolby Vision and support for the upcoming 2.1 HDMI standard and has been open to lending some of their iconic characters to Nintendo for use in their games. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I don't buy $59.99 or $399.99 consoles from Microsoft but rather get a cheap pass to play whatever I want. Sony should do the same thing so I can get rid of my Playstation and just play games on my PC. Click to expand... I get what you are saying and for those who would rather play on pc I guess that would be the perfect scenario. However, and I don't pretend to understand much about tech (I'm more old school as I was out of college before computers really started hitting homes), but like stated pc is MS. Not Sony. Maybe if sony had an os that came standard on just about every pc it could make more sense. MS doesn't care if you play on xbox or pc because they are getting all your money one way or the other. I can't see MS affording Sony that if they need to use a windows platform. Click to expand... They already have remote play that can be installed on other devices. It's extremely limited though. What they need to do is take something like PSNow and make it public knowledge you can use it on any device while simply connecting something like a DS4 to your tablet device to play anywhere you want. Currently, not many people know about remote play because Sony does not promote it. In order for it to work you need to have your PS4 connected to the internet. You also have to use third-party apps in order to get it working on devices like iOS tablets. It has an app for PC I use it. Why does it need all that trouble? There's plenty of quality of life improvements they can make it that can possibly turn it into a huge streaming service similar to Netflix for games. It would be especially attractive for people who already own consoles and just want to play something somewhere else without needing to carry their console around with them. Secondly, you dig into a market that's always on the fence due to your expensive hardware and you could even dent the used games/rental market. It seems like a very smart investment to me because in the modern world mobile technology is where everything is going anyway. I have a tablet with me everywhere I go with my smartphone. The download option is LONG overdue. This should've been implemented years ago. Only major hurdle I could see on pushing something like this across many devices would you'd need to be exclusively streaming due to hardware limitations and not enough storage to download a game. Click to expand... I feel Sony wouldn’t have invested in the infrastructure for streaming if they didn’t really plan to make use of it outside of a console.",,sean9986,United States of America,Louisiana,New Orleans,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I peruse PSN from my PS4, Nintendo Game Store from my Switch, or Steam from my PC. They always have a writeup, trailers, and reviews from other buyers. I've discovered several games I wouldn't have heard of otherwise just by checking out what looks cool to me and then checking outside reviews e.g. metacritic etc. Also perusing game news/review sites like IGN.com. I like shooters but I never really play them...there's a lot more than shooters out there. @cookepuss: In this day and age of accessibility, ""don't use things you don't own"" will be a tough sell. Its not my intention to 'encourage' it but as far as preventing others, good luck. It's like being a vegan lol. Do your thing, but preaching might be a waste of time. Roms are easy, fun, nostalgic, with little obvious downside, and not much preventing it, so people will do it. No to mention, many game devs no longer exist and there is no other way to play those games if it were not for emu/roms. The industry needs to find a way to handle it. As an example, record labels tried suing Napster and users but streaming services like Spotify have probably done more to curb music piracy than litigation and intimidation. If Nintendo charged a low monthly rate for their entire back catalog of old games instead of charging 5 bucks AGAIN to play gen 1 NES games AGAIN that could make using roms more hassle than it's worth for many. A video game company's primary reason for being is to make money, so they should adopt a model where they aren't losing out on old IPs. Clearly there is a market. I see your points and they are valid, I just think a lecture isn't going to be very effective. Do you not have MP3s or any other un-purchased retail media at all? If not, if you are fully clean, then hey, more power to you. @skeebertus: ^ That said, I also can't agree with your justification for using roms, especially by bashing the companies that make them. Your anger/annoyance with them may be deserved but dissatisfaction doesn't give anyone the 'right' to use their IP. If you download a Super Mario Bros rom, It's stolen, period. That point can't really be debated, can it? The question is not whether emulators are legal (in most cases its either plainly not or its a grey area). The question is just whether you care to let that stop you because it's so easy and not really enforced. You don't really have a legitimate moral or legal defense. It is what it is. IMO its more about ease and value. I have my fair share of illegally obtained MP3s. I was under no illusions that I had the 'right' to use them or some other justification to theft. I now use Spotify or Youtube 100% of the time because its easier. I have purchased many retrogame bundles and re-releases but i still use roms. Sony has PSNow, I hope Nintendo follows suit in the fall with their online service.",,kemijo,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Click to expand... At the end of the day whether you play on xbox or pc it is all MS so why would they care? You are still part of their ecosystem. Click to expand... Exactly that's why they do it. I don't buy $59.99 games or $399.99 consoles from Microsoft but rather get a cheap pass to play whatever I want. Sony should do the same thing so I can get rid of my Playstation and just play games on my PC. The alternative as I mentioned is they could be cutting into renting/used games revenue which is a return in itself even if they're not getting the console adoption rates anymore. A single unified platform by subscribing to a few services is far more attractive. Nintendo is on the cross-play hype train. Archaic ass Nintendo online. Sony needs to stop being complacent and start realizing their competition is starting to surpass them slowly in other ways. Portability playing anywhere on any device is the future. With Sony's PSNow they could take it a bigger step forward than what Microsoft has now. Allow me to install the app on any android/iOS device. My windows PC. Play anywhere anytime without needing a PS4. That's far more attractive and would be your service in the hands of unlimited consumer/commercial potential. They need to first get their head of their asses and stop sitting into a single small closed ecosystem before it can exist. This is the world we live in with technology where you can access anything anywhere at anytime. That's where the next step of innovation needs to go in console gaming.

Once the bandwidth speeds catch up proper, and the data usage isn't an issue, it's gonna be commonplace. ""Playstation Now"" was a little ahead of it's time. I used it for a month though, and it was pretty impressive for the most part. Once the kinks are all ironed out, and the games have no difference from their retail counterparts, it's a slam dunk for the industry. You'll pony up $20 or $30 a month to play whatever you want, and will totally accept that you no longer own anything. This. EA is reading the tea leaves. Anyone who is rational can see this. Why? We've seen it happen, now, twice, in the two other major entertainment media: (1) Music (2) Movies It isn't a coincidence that they happened in this order. It's directly correlated to bandwidth. Streaming was able to handle music first, then movies. Books would have predated music, but they didn't have a widespread electronic form. What do we have, now? Spotify, Pandora, and the rest for music. We have Netflix, Hulu, and the rest for movies. The major tech players-- Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft-- have presence in both worlds. Amazon Prime is becoming a glorified cloud rental service for books. Video games are by far the most bandwidth-intensive of all media. They're last. It's going to be much more difficult, considering the physical limitations, but the truth is the consumer market hasn't demonstrated much of an appetite for 4K (or VR/AR), so the next phase is bringing 1080p to streaming. The It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World spec race is finally over. There's a reason we all got sick of those, ""To the cloud!"" commercials a decade ago. The business world isn't stupid.

FireDrakeZ posted... @OneTruePlayer81 I know. I was considering subscribing to PSNow for a month on my gaming PC to play PS3 and PS4 exclusives that I am interested in and then cancelling it. It doesn't include the latest games though. Gamepass on the other hand, includes the latest AAA games like State of Decay 2, Sea of Thieves, (as well as slightly older AAA games like Gears of War 4, Fallout 4, the Division, Rise of the Tomb Raider) at launch without having to pay the inflated launch prices for these games. And these games are downloaded and not subject to the vagaries of streaming that you find on PSNow. You can even access classic OGXBox games that are now back compatible and enhanced on Xbox One X like STAR WARS™ - Knights of the Old Republic™ on Gamepass. Yeah sorry, I didn't read your first post properly. Although I wouldn't count state of decay and sea of thieves as AAA tbh The point is that Gamepass will include many new games including Xbox exclusives that would normally cost you a lot to buy on launch and not just older games like on PSNow. With the 5 studios that Microsoft just added producing new games, and upcoming AAA staples like Gears 5, Halo Infinity and Forza Horizon 4, etc. coming in the near future, it would make that gaming subscription a very good deal indeed. https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass Would it not bother you guys if Microsoft's game pass subscription pushed the industry towards even more monetisation of games, even more ""games as service"", even more over-reaching with DRM? Genuine question. I'm not defending psnow(I don't partake). And I'm not saying this is an absolute. But judging by what microsoft wants with DRM and the monetization of first party games and subscription based services, it's hard to imagine that's not the overall intention. But maybe not It looks like both Microsoft and Sony are moving in that direction(games as a service). Personally I prefer to own my games(already have a bigger backlog than I can handle) instead of playing them via a subscription service but I find it useful in the case of PSNow on my gaming PC, since I prefer not having to buy a Sony console to play their few exclusives.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I already have a gaming PC that can access PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) via PSNow, so for me the Xbox One X was the supplemental console choice that I needed. The Xbox One X again is the best model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor Handicapped accesible peripherals and controllers The One X is also better than my PC right now on multi-platforms at least until I can upgrade my gpu Finally aside from those mentioned above many of which were added post launch, Microsoft is dedicated to adding even more features based on feedback from their customers, including Dolby Vision and support for the upcoming 2.1 HDMI standard and has been open to lending some of their iconic characters to Nintendo for use in their games. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. You made this topic in the PS4 board and you got ripped apart. You have now made it in the Xbox board and are getting ripped apart lol. If you have a gaming pc why would you need an Xbox 1.

The impact to relationships between platform holders and 3rd parties: If a 3rd party has plans to make a remaster (Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, RE2, Metal Gear, Okami) then those plans are neutered by the BC offered by the platform holder. Where is the revenue coming in to offset these? It's not coming from the consumer that expects BC. It's not coming from 'good faith'. Schrödinger's cat said: BC doesn't open new markets. It stifles them. This closes revenue streams, it doesn't open them. You do realize that the revenue coming from Xbox's current BC program is a real and tangible thing, right? Games that were previously ""stuck"" on the Xbox 360 have found a new home, digitally, on the Xbox One. Stuff like Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, Crackdown, Fable, etc are now once again available for digital purchase and are able to be further incentive for additional programs such as Games with Gold and Game Pass - meaning they're earning these game's publishers additional revenue. If the PS5 ships without backwards compatibility, Ubisoft loses it's ability to make money selling their previous Assassin's Creed games to a new audience - people who didn't own a PS4 but now bought a PS5 (whether they are simply new console owners, or made the switch from Xbox) have no way of buying Assassin's Creed Odyssey short of also buying a previous-gen console. Sony loses too, because their game library looks really sparse since they maybe only have 4-5 launch titles. This is especially so when their competition has backwards compatibility so the Xbox Two or whatever has literally thousands of games (including that Assassin's Creed Odyssey game you heard was awesome) available immediately. So in this scenario Ubisoft loses, Sony loses, and customers lose. Arguably, Sony's loss would be the highest - because getting people to buy a console without BC is like making them start over. It's an easy way to entrench the current generation in your ecosystem and continue their market dominance at the beginning of the next rather than having a lot of people jump ship to the (faster, shinier, cooler, whatever) console of their choice.",,jshackles,United States of America,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,

It's smaller and more portable than a switch, it has more battery life and there's loads of Jrpgs. Still, I don't see Sony fighting Nintendo in their own turf to be honest, Sony already has Microsoft to contend with and sony's market is photorealistic gaming just like microsoft's, I just can't see them doing a Vita 2 with less power than a PS4 which will compete directly with the Switch in an already Switch dominated market. And if the Vita developers start putting all their games on the switch instead(which you can already see to a degree with the lack PS4 to vita ports and the existence of ports to the switch), then the Switch will become the new Vita in Japan, which is the region that matters the most for Jrpgs. Also according to rumors and speculation, Sony may be preparing to design a 5G network enabled console in order to fulfill the photorealistic gaming market on the go utilizing Cloud/Streaming and 5G network speeds to do that, but that means having to pay for data usage, lack of coverage in certain spaces(subway) and most probably PSNOW kind of service too.

I tested the first couple introductory sequences of Ni No Kuni 1, which went well, and then tested the complete edition of DC Injustice 1 complete edition. The latter was ok, though some of the button inputs (hit-->hit-->combo in the tutorial) I could never get to work properly, presumably because of some input lag (though the graphics did not appear to lag at all). Everything else seemed to be perfectly stable. In order to determine whether or not this is worth it (the Injustice testing results didn't bother me too much, since I would be getting PSNow to catch up on old single player stuff, and not multiplayer), are there any other games you could recommend as ""test cases"" to see whether Now would work for me?

There are some potential aspects of cloud gaming that are appealing but as of now it's still a ways off to being acceptable to the masses. The internet infrastructure isn't there and the current subscription models out there are a mess. Pretty much this. To elaborate, cloud gaming is never going to work for certain genres. Specifically, games that are fast paced and/or rely on quick reactions. The subscription model can work, but publishers first have to swallow their pride offer a lot more for a lot less. Subscriptions on a per game basis will fail. They need to offer a quality library at about the price of Netlfix or Hulu subscription. Lastly there needs to be a means to 'buy' the game separately from the subscription, even if it is still streamed to the player. There are a lot of games I would grab off of PSNow of they had this option.",,BlackPhoenix127,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

In the week leading up to E3, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot predicted that there may be just one more generation of console hardware before streaming becomes the ubiquitous platform for games of all kinds. ""There will be one more console generation and then after that, we will be streaming,"" he said. ""All of us."" This thread was also picked up by EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who used the E3 stage to speak directly to the growing influence of streaming and subscriptions on how the company thinks about its future. When Xbox head Phil Spencer revealed that Microsoft was actually developing a streaming platform (possibly as a replacement for the download-based Xbox Game Pass), E3 2018 suddenly became about so much more than which games will be released in the next 12 months. Ultimately, these far-reaching ideas tainted the view of Sony's more restrained briefing, which contained barely a word about its plans for PlayStation Now. Instead, Sony used its position of strength in the market to focus on a handful of big games - a strategy that left many (both in the room and watching from afar) feeling underwhelmed. ""It is possible that a few years from now Microsoft will be the Netflix of gaming and Sony more like HBO"" Joost van Dreunen ""With an install base of 75 million that makes sense for now,"" says Joost van Dreunen, CEO and co-founder of SuperData Research. ""But it does not provide an answer to the question what the future holds. Worse, it is inconsistent with the direction senior management recently revealed - plans to focus on subscription revenue from online gaming and streaming music and video."" Where Microsoft surpassed Sony is in doing both: showing a slate of 50 games (most of them not exclusive, it should be noted) and doubling its first-party studio roster, while also improving Xbox Game Pass and indicating that streaming will be the next step. ""In particular, this last part is promising,"" van Dreunen says. ""Although Microsoft has failed to win the centre of the living room as it originally set out to do, it is setting itself up to become the leader in the digital games market by equally amassing content and focusing on distribution rollout. It is possible that a few years from now Microsoft will be the Netflix of gaming and Sony more like HBO. ""But a digital future is about scale and infrastructure, which means that Microsoft may yet claim the centre."" via https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articl...om-playstation",,wraggster,United Kingdom,East Midlands,Nottingham,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Streaming could be key to Xbox reclaiming the lead from PlayStation,,,

We're probably nearing the end of the PS4's prime by 2020 I believe, so another two good years of new games are likely before developers start with the phasing out, then focusing their energy towards a new console. Or they can still do cross platform ports as people transition to the PS5, if that's what might happen.

A ""service"" which requires an internet connection and an added cost in order to play games you've owned for 10 years. This kind of ludicrous nonsense is right up there with releasing the PS4 Pro without a UHD player. Even the base ($299) XBone S has one. All that considered, the PS4 is a fantastic console which I have been quite happy with but Sony made some seriously poor decisions during the creation of the original and the PS4 Pro refresh. I agree the PS4 should've had a UHD player to be competitive with the XB1S. For backwards compatibility, I remember hearing there was a big roadblock to making that happen. BC is a cool feature, but I still have all my old consoles so I can hook them up to play when I want to relive the past gaming adventures. The only one I traded in was the 360 after it burnt out for the 3rd time and they kept sending me refurbished junk. The 4th one I didn't even use and just traded it in towards the PS3. Quote: Originally Posted by Derb Switching to the X86 architecture from the Cell made BC next to impossible. MS didn?t have that problem going forward. Hopefully Sony will have BC with the PS5, but there is no reason for them to do it other than a marketing ploy. Yes, the Cell tech was so complicated that a lot of developers favored the simplicity of the 360's PC structure instead of having to learn the Cell's. One reason Bethesda had such buggy games compared to the much less buggy 360 versions. I remember there was mention that the cell was more complicated to develop for. And another reason Sony dropped it for a simpler set up for developers for PS4.",,Zivouhr,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I've been replaying Fallout 3 GotY Edition on PS3, I've gotten pretty far into it again and its still just as easy to get hooked and immerse yourself.

F3 is 720p with no anti-aliasing so if you're outside on a sunny day everything looks like its made of staircases and sawblades... Fallout 76 he said IS online only but you can do private servers like with GTA Online which means you'll be by yourself..... the b**** is having to pay for PSN Plus just to do that, hope it has free online like some games do such as The Crew. I wanted F3 remaster so I could play it with add ons on my Ps4, I sold my Ps3 ages ago, and the version on PsNow isn't even worth the free trial with no addons oh and they said they would be adding private servers, but it would not be ready at launch. last time Bethesda said something like that it took what a year to get the content? Get a PC if you want good f3. You can get one that can run the game fully maxed with 50+ mods for under $200 these days.

Well if PsNow dont incorperate day one exclusives then if wont last. They also need to bring the service to pc, making every game they make multiplat. Can you see them doing this? Difference is if say Zenimax made a service (which is unlikely) and given the strong relationship MS have with Bethesda, MS wouldn't fund some sort of deal with them? Streaming services rely on content, and funding for it, and if this is the future then MS have the funds to make such deals happen. I think you're having a completely different conversation... I'm talking about how it'll be in a decade or so when streaming is the default way to play games and not consoles. There won't be such a thing as Multiplatform games as far as the major publishers go. EA at E3 announced their plans for a streaming service, Capcom will be streaming RE7 to switch so they're also testing the waters, other publishers like Bethesda, Ubisoft, Take-Two, WB, etc. will no doubt follow suit. There's no question of Sony having exclusives in that space as their streaming service like everyone else's will be available on all devices, there also won't be a question of their games being on it day 1 as it will be the default method of delivering their games. Games will basically be exclusive to each publisher's own streaming service not a hardware device. The deals will only come into play regarding independent developers or small publishers who don't have a big enough game output or capital to warrant their own service, which basically consists of Indies and mostly Japanese publishers who aren't Square Enix, Capcom, or Namco. In light of that I think it's good that MS is investing in it's first party because exclusives will be the be all end all of any company that wants to stay in the gaming business. You really think people would pay subscription to Sony, Xbox, Nintendo, EA, Ubisoft, Zenimax, Activision etc etc just to play their games? You'll absoultely still have multiplats",,xSublimex,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Where is the revenue coming in to offset these? It's not coming from the consumer that expects BC. It's not coming from 'good faith'. Stuff like this really reads like i never used a PC in my life. How are there manufacturing and distribution pipeline of multi sku's? The old game already exists and therefore that's that. If they plan on making remasters they can and provide extra stuff and focus there attention on that from that point on and charge again money for a game that is already paid for. What is the ongoing costs of patch availability, how is steam coping with the fact i still lets you download dead games from decades ago? it's a non issue. It's a service that you provide and its a service that makes it so people invest into your platform to start with. It's a non issue. What online costs for online functions? you mean they have to keep up services that people already paid for and push confidence into there platform and attract more people that spend more money at the end as result? How is blizzard coping with patches for warcraft 3 after 15 years or how many years that game is out now. I bet they go bankrupt because of it. Not really, it's why people go out of there way to buy there next game and invest into it heavily because support is endless. And even if they didn't patch game still playable without issue's. If they aim at online games, they could easily just make a second profile and adjust settings for that console with it much like PC is doing. Again non issue. Hell they could even provide you a unlocked FPS solution with a setting tab ( which games already do on pro/x1x ). If they don't care for patches, then who cares really. most games on PC are dead after x amount of time but still perfectly playable. PC even goes further with users making there own versions or running there own servers for those games. A good example is AOEO, only has 70 people playerbase yet can run full blown servers and patches + new content all day long, and they are not the only ones. Even private servers i know that run with a 500-1500 user base make up to 7 million a year out of it through digital whales on death games ( RO ) and they run different versions of different games all simultaneously without issue's. Why? because people support them and like to play those games for nostalgic reasons. And yes those people pay your bills perfectly fine. It's just trying to find excuses for Sony to not provide. Nothing is new nothing is hard, it's all be done on PC already endlessly amounts of times. The money comes from: 1) People have more confidence into your platform and therefore boosts platform sales. 2) Good PR. 3) Whales will appear that invest massive amounts of cash into games simple because they can and care about. Aka a new market. There are tons of people that sit on decade old games and spend tons of cash in it just for that new hat. 4) Upgrading towards a new generation is far more attractive way faster for many people as they can sell of there old console and move on the to next one while still being able to play all there games with all there friends they already had. ( Also more attractive for devs ) 5) Second handed market is getting killed entirely much like on steam, as people no longer trade games which has a massive impact on sales on longer peroids of time ( basically console piracy as you could see it ) 6) Get access to far more user information then you currently have and push them locked down into a echo system that they bound with through friends and other community's they are connection towards. 7) Game developers making a larger cut by moving away from physical storefront, which result in cheaper prices for consumers, better discounts on better time frames and more profit. 8) Make renting games more accessible and profitable. 9) 10) Opening ways to endless BC through streaming, basically budget gaming on its extreme. Which opens again a new market. Specially if your user base is 100% digital. Aka check digital PC front on this matter.

I literally just told you what. The game's difficulty lies pretty much solely in it's control scheme. Take that away and you have a stupidly simple action game. It is not like REMake where you can make the game a little simpler while still maintaining a lot of what made the original games challenging. It would make the games a complete cake walk. And like I said before, a game with tank controls is not going to have enough mainstream appeal to even warrant a remake/remaster. Best you could hope for is if the games show up on Playstation Now. Once again, so what? I'm playing the game for its story, not its difficulty. Key word: I'm. You might want it, but it isn't going to have mainstream appeal. That is just the hard truth, it is why the game series as a whole hasn't even broken the 8 million sales mark despite having 7 games (4 of them main series). Capcom isn't going to do it if they can't guarantee at least 1 million sales, and there is no way it is going to even come close to that.",,Dikitain,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

I already have a gaming PC that can access PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) via PSNow, so for me the Xbox One X was the supplemental console choice that I needed. The Xbox One X again is the best console model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Gamepass - best and most affordable subscription program for a new console owner with access to the latest games right off the bat EA Access - for some reason Sony didn't allow EA to add this app to access the EA game library for the PS4 Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor The One X is also better than my PC right now on multi-platforms at least until I can upgrade my gpu Finally aside from those mentioned above many of which were added post launch, Microsoft is dedicated to adding even more features based on feedback from their customers, including Dolby Vision and support for the upcoming 2.1 HDMI standard and has been open to lending some of their iconic characters to Nintendo for use in their games. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. ...price and lack of exclusives are just two reasons according to this... https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/691088-xbox-one/76731086",,quincy2000a,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I assumed the PS3 tales were on psnow but looks like not even a single one of the 4 are on there so guess that's not an option. I suppose I'll just plat beseria since I'm already close anyway with most titles being done and just play a different title all together until vesperia remaster,,MassiveKaos,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

All that considered, the PS4 is a fantastic console which I have been quite happy with but Sony made some seriously poor decisions during the creation of the original and the PS4 Pro refresh.

Sign-ins appear are listed as being unaffected, but creating accounts or editing your profile may both prove problematic. Worse, the Gaming and Social area of PSN is encountering problems.

PSNow downloading of PS4 games.......makes sense. Reduces server time once downloaded. The crossplay enabling is just them backpedaling due to the controversy it has caused. They will make it ""sound"" like a wonderful thing they are doing for the gamers, instead of just caving to gamer backlash. PSN name change.......this one could be a sneaky-sneaky........like, it will be a PS5 thing where they use a ""new"" PSN and use that as a excuse to complicate (or effectively eliminate) PS5's backwards compatibility with PS4. Possibly even leaving PS3/PSP/Vita digital in the dust. Obviously, I could be wrong (and I very much hope I am), but I can't help but think Sony will come up with some way to make PS4 BC on PS5 not just an easy or automatic thing. Like making you pay for PS4 games again, or do some sort of migration process where a game will only work on one system or the other, or just say nope to BC altogether. And I'm sure they'd love to free up all that space PS3/PSP/Vita digital games are taking up. Regardless of what ends up actually happening, I'm pretty sure whatever they do will be to benefit THEM more than it will benefit us. It just won't necessarily seem that way on the surface.

The Xbox One X again is the best model of this gen with the most features, the best hardware geared specifically for my 4K HDR TV and again is the console with the best version for multi-platforms not only for this generation but for previous generations(enhanced mode) as well. With my Xbox One X, it also saves me the cost of having to buy a separate 4K HDR blu ray player(which is not available on the PS4 Pro) just to watch movies in that resolution on disc. Other reasons for buying it(features not available on the PS4 Pro) Back compatibility - especially since I already have an extensive 360 library including exclusives from 3 generations of Xbox consoles. 500+ games listed and rising Enhanced modes - provides the best version for exclusive and multi-platform games with either increased resolution up to 4K or performance up to 60 fps in many games. 200+ games and rising Gamepass subscription - allowing you to play the latest(and multiple) AAA games on launch with a reasonable and affordable subscription fee without having to pay $60 or more to buy each game. In contrast PSNow only has older PS3 and PS4 games. Xbox One Controller - natively recognized not only by my console but also by my Windows 10 PC Dolby Atmos surround sound support Free Sync (or Variable Refresh Rate) Support - nice feature found on high end gaming PCs that will help reduce stuttering and tearing Automatic Game Mode - to reduce input lag Ability to play games in native 4K HDR resolution Play Anywhere option - quite convenient for me since I am also a PC gamer allowing me to shift from one platform to another depending upon where I am located and bringing my saves and achievements with me on either platform . It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Buy the game once and play it on both platforms allowing me to play the same game on my Windows 10 laptop, or tablet while traveling and on my big screen 4K TV when I return home Discord app(popular with gaming PC users) integration with the Xbox social app Cross Platform play between Xbox and PC, Switch and other platforms in games like Fortnight, Minecraft, etc. UI that is integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft website on my PC Smaller form factor The One X is also better than my PC right now on multi-platforms at least until I can upgrade my gpu Finally aside from those mentioned above many of which were added post launch, Microsoft is dedicated to adding even more features based on feedback from their customers, including Dolby Vision and support for the upcoming 2.1 HDMI standard and has been open to lending some of their iconic characters to Nintendo for use in their games. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting anti-consumer practices. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. If Sony matches this features especially with regards to back compatibility next gen, I certainly would consider getting a PS5. Otherwise if I had to get a console I would prefer the more customer friendly Xbox 2 with their many PC like features. But who knows with the ""games as a service"" direction that these companies(Microsoft and Sony) are heading to, an upgraded PC might be all I might require for my gaming needs in the future.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Makes sense since there's no emulator as of yet for PS3. They also are saying you can only download 4 titles at a time. ====================::==================== firesq4014 said: ↑ deuce985 said: ↑ firesq4014 said: ↑ At the end of the day whether you play on xbox or pc it is all MS so why would they care? You are still part of their ecosystem. Click to expand... Exactly that's why they do it. I don't buy $59.99 or $399.99 consoles from Microsoft but rather get a cheap pass to play whatever I want. Sony should do the same thing so I can get rid of my Playstation and just play games on my PC. Click to expand... I get what you are saying and for those who would rather play on pc I guess that would be the perfect scenario. However, and I don't pretend to understand much about tech (I'm more old school as I was out of college before computers really started hitting homes), but like stated pc is MS. Not Sony. Maybe if sony had an os that came standard on just about every pc it could make more sense. MS doesn't care if you play on xbox or pc because they are getting all your money one way or the other. I can't see MS affording Sony that if they need to use a windows platform. Click to expand... They already have remote play that can be installed on other devices. It's extremely limited though. What they need to do is take something like PSNow and make it public knowledge you can use it on any device while simply connecting something like a DS4 to your tablet device to play anywhere you want. Currently, not many people know about remote play because Sony does not promote it. In order for it to work you need to have your PS4 connected to the internet. You also have to use third-party apps in order to get it working on devices like iOS tablets. It has an app for PC I use it. Why does it need all that trouble? There's plenty of quality of life improvements they can make it that can possibly turn it into a huge streaming service similar to Netflix for games. It would be especially attractive for people who already own consoles and just want to play something somewhere else without needing to carry their console around with them. Secondly, you dig into a market that's always on the fence due to your expensive hardware and you could even dent the used games/rental market. It seems like a very smart investment to me because in the modern world mobile technology is where everything is going anyway. I have a tablet with me everywhere I go with my smartphone. The download option is LONG overdue. This should've been implemented years ago. Only major hurdle I could see on pushing something like this across many devices would you'd need to be exclusively streaming due to hardware limitations and not enough storage to download a game.",,deuce985,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,PSN Now to allow downloads starting in September,,,

The fact is that even post launch Microsoft continues to add features to their console and has been very receptive to feedback from their customers as to which they want to add even more. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti-consumer practices in their arrogance.

Not really confidence but has turned into a fantroll paradise that board is toxic. Actually I noticed that a lot of Sony fanboys have migrated to the Xbox One boards because it seems that the PS4 board has become obsessed with this SJW nonsense and because complaints about Sony not allowing their gamers to play with Switch owners, instead of talking about games. The only toxicity I noticed on the Xbox One boards is when the Sony fanboys invade those boards, and attack Xbox One owners in a disrespectful manner. I also notice them doing the same thing on the PC and Nintendo boards. Then your definitely looking at that board with some heavy blinders on. All you need to see is the fire storm that erupted on this board with TLOU 2 after E3. Basically every other post started was about that topic. Add to that the Fortnite controversy and it drove away PS4 fans who wanted to discuss just games.

No reason to voluntarily go into gaming purgatory. Have you seen the suffering on the xb1 board this gen? They all hate this gen, believe it or not. Not at all. The Xbox One X has restored the confidence of many Xbox fans and with the direction that Microsoft has taken in terms of acquiring 5 new studios to develop first party games, exclusives is not going to be an issue in the future as well. The fact is that even post launch Microsoft continues to add features to their console and has been very receptive to feedback from their customers as to which they want to add even more. In contrast, Sony has stopped making improvements on their console and has refused to let their customers from interacting with their other console rivals adopting basically anti-consumer practices in their arrogance. They are basically just relying on their few exclusives to keep their customer base happy. But for a PC gamer like me, I can always access those eventually via PSNow, so why not get the best console available in the market instead for the reasons listed above. First of all for them to get those 5 studios was a good move but before you judge wait for their games to release first,as for the features and sony being kinda arrogant i agree but thats what happens when a company stays in top for too long and when there is no competition.The last part you said for me makes absolutely no sense,if you are a pc gamer and especially if you have a good pc why would you invest in a console that will give you NOTHING more?Sony's console on the other hand could be your supplementary place to play for their exclusives which is the MAIN reason a person in their right mind buys a console",,Giorgos115,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

175056575457,6/19/2018,http://barbosaasouza.tumblr.com/post/175056575457,"PlayStation Now is a service that PS4 users can subscribe to that allows players to access various titles to stream at a flat rate each month. It offers several different games for you to blow through just like Xbox’s Game Pass service, but the catch is that you have to stream the games, which isn’t optimal for everyone. If you don’t have decent internet service, it can be a nightmare.

But it looks like Sony is doing a little something to alleviate that going forward. According to an industry source that confirmed the news to Kotaku UK, downloadable games are coming to PlayStation Now later this year, namely in September. It will be limited to PlayStation 4 titles for now, at least at first, but it will allow players to download titles they’d like to play later instead of having to stream them all.

You’ll be able to keep games you download much in the same way that PlayStation Plus titles become added to your collection. As long as you keep a PlayStation Now subscription, you can play them offline and at your leisure on your primary PS4, and with other accounts on the same system.

Kotaku UK reached out for further, official comment from Sony regarding the situation, but the company hasn’t replied just yet. If it does indeed end up happening, this could certainly make PlayStation Now more of a viable competitor to Xbox Game Pass, and it’s good news for Sony fans overall.

You really think giving that MS have Azure cloud servers, and the tech and knowledge to provide such a service, that'll itll be worse than what Sony offer? PsNow is overpriced, and has latency issues. Streaming won't be in effect for a decade yet. MS has all the pieces in place with Game Pass, and also looking yo bring streaming to mobile devices",,xSublimex,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

This would not be a good thing as then Sony would basically have zero competition. Since most 3rd part games are not on Nintendo systems as of late. Plus having a competitor who is trying to close the gap by offering consumer family products and policies like game pass, game share, good rewards programs, etc it keeps the top dog on his toes. For example PSnow will soon start allowing full downloads of some games which is what game pass does now. I also read the pro came out in direct response to the X. Lastly in the US sales of both systems are similar with Sony having a slight lead. MS isn't going anywhere anytime soon and that's good.

Little is known about the upcoming Navi chip, although it is thought that it will be based on 7 nanometre process technology, but will not be designed to compete in the high-end PC market; some journalists have even theorised that the architecture is being designed with the PS5 in mind. The suggestion that the PS5 will come in 2020 is in direct contradiction to a claim made by Tsuyoshi Kodera last month, in which he said that the PS5 was three years away. ====================::==================== >>421064568 Show me a PS4 console that us backwards compatible with PS1 or PS2.

I've been replaying Fallout 3 GotY Edition on PS3, I've gotten pretty far into it again and its still just as easy to get hooked and immerse yourself. Honestly the only reason I wanted a remaster/remake was for better visuals and bug fixes. F3 is 720p with no anti-aliasing so if you're outside on a sunny day everything looks like its made of staircases and sawblades... Fallout 76 he said IS online only but you can do private servers like with GTA Online which means you'll be by yourself..... the b**** is having to pay for PSN Plus just to do that, hope it has free online like some games do such as The Crew. I wanted F3 remaster so I could play it with add ons on my Ps4, I sold my Ps3 ages ago, and the version on PsNow isn't even worth the free trial with no addons oh and they said they would be adding private servers, but it would not be ready at launch. last time Bethesda said something like that it took what a year to get the content?",,MHettenbach,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

My god was it laggy, probably due to playing on PSNow, because I don't recall it being that laggy on PS3. But strangely enough, I encountered a lot and I mean a lot of SOLO players. I myself was playing SOLO, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that Tag team players were very few and far in between. Once I got used to the delay a bit and I adjusted, I must say I had a grand time. It felt really good, to play as some old fav characters. Armor King in particular felt good to control again.(Like an artist, who held a paint brush again after years of taking a break, everything just came back to me and flowed naturally, as if something was missing from your life). The single character juggles and wall carry was quite tame and did roughly 50- 60 points of damage. With a wall it went to about 70 or so. I never particularly enjoyed playing tag teams. But I remember playing a bit back in the day because a lot of my fav characters received new tools for their arsenal(Kaz b4,1 felt quite nice to use again, Anna's qcf1 was pure ecstasy, there's just nothing quite like it), and the netcode was far superior to T6 at the time. Anyway, imagine if Namco decided to rerelease a SOLO version of this game, (No,....Revolution doesn't count, that game was cancer, more so than the Tag mechanics) would any of you object to this idea? The one thing I found a bit tough getting used to again was waking up. I forgot holding back makes your character roll backwards and leaves you highly vulnerable. And the toe kick is inferior to T7s. Neverthelss I found myself really enjoying playing single characters in this game. Obviously a solo rerelease is most likely never going to happen, but the idea of it is fun to entertain. Thoughts?.......",,MeteorStone,United States of America,,,Negative,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,,,,
