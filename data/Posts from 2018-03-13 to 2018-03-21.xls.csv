You're not even close to being factual there. First) Demon's Souls is already playable on pc by: 1) Emulation 2) Sony's streaming service Second) It is always only a matter of time until a console (or any computer architectur in general) gets a proper emulator, so Bloodborne too, will come to pc. If Sony's streaming service is a big enough success, and with the advent of faster and faster internet speed, I'm sure PS4 titles will be added to the streaming service at least after a PS5 is released. The only thing that sucks is that we will not get to play these awesome titles online, because DeS servers are down, and sure BB's servers are going to be offline once a proper ps4 emulator is released, too. Who knows, there are already people making own server ""hacks"" in order to keep on playing DeS online, and it works, check it out! So yeah, see you all in 10 years in Bloodborne on pc via emulator and a self hosted p2p server, lol. Dude, when people say DeS and Bloodborne ain't happening on PC they mean officially. Playing a dodge copy on an emulator isn't official. And playing via streaming service isn't a PC version either, it's basically playing the game over the internet. It's not a PC version of the game. It's still the PS3 version. I'm not your dude, especially not if you are going to ignore facts. How is an official streaming service from Sony where you could play Demon Souls on not an official release? Who cares if you bought the the game retail, digital, or if you stream it, as long as it is on pc? Aren't we talking about playing DeS on pc? If you argue about ""releasing"" in retail or digital shelf, then that's just avoiding the fact that I stated about playstation now. It's about playing on pc, isn't it?

The major advantage here is that the device you use doesn't matter anymore. Your cellphone could give you an Xbox One X caliber experience despite not being as powerful, since the game isn't really running on your phone. It's running on a more powerful device somewhere else. This is how Playstation Now works today. high end games that run highly responsive compute locally while offloading heavy latency tolerant workloads to the cloud The actual game is run on your current device, but parts of the game's logic will be run ""in the cloud"". Things that need to be quick and responsive (IE how your character responds to what you do on your controller) will happen on your current device, while things that need a lot of power and/or can afford some delay (IE physics calculations) will happen on another device elsewhere. It would allow you to have more detailed games without needing significantly more powerful hardware. This is similar to what they're doing with Crackdown 3. Think about it this way (and here's where I get away from human language so bear with me, I'm oversimplifying a lot here to make it understandable): The game you play is a set of logical stuff that needs to happen and graphical stuff that needs to happen on your device. Your device has two main processors (workers): a CPU, and a GPU. CPU = logic stuff (AI, physics, etc) GPU = graphic stuff (resolution, lighting, shadowing, details, etc) In the PSNow model, all logic stuff and graphic stuff happens in the cloud. You just provide your controller inputs that get sent off to the cloud for the logic stuff and graphic stuff to happen and be sent back to you via video. This model is great when it works, but sometimes it can have a delay and is prone to the same problems you have with Netflix and YouTube (stuck buffering, inconsistent quality, etc). In the Crackdown model, graphics stuff is handled locally on your device while some logic stuff is handled in the cloud. This is kind of a ""best of both worlds"" model where you still need a powerful device to give you the cutting-edge graphics you want from your device but also allows your game to have more complex logic stuff by using the cloud than it normally would if it didn't have access to the processing power in the cloud.",,DrasticGoDown,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

After much debacle (which is an entire story on its own) I finally got them to agree to a refund. We are moving house in two weeks, and are refusing to watch any TV, nor plug it in, etc. I have just had a response that they WILL process my refund... but only AFTER the given date. However, as I have already well-overpaid my licence to beyond our moving date, are they allowed to do this? If they have agreed to a refund, and know which date to which they need to calculate the refund, why can they withhold the money? It's not like they're waiting on more direct debits from me - they'll owe me five months' on the licence that I've already paid for. The money they owe me will be sitting in their account, instead of earning interest (albeit miniscule but that's not the point) in mine. Is this legal? What are the rules on the timescales of refunds, especially once one has been agreed in writing?

It does seem that they are simply incapable of understanding that a prepaid license, cancelled from a predetermined date, can be refunded from the day a refund is agreed! I don't plan to watch or stream any TV when I move, so this is entirely to be LLF and not dodging anything. We only use the TV for the playstation now - if the beggars want to come and check they wouldn't find any aerial nor could we be watching iPlayer as you now have to log in (even to listen to the radio!) And I refuse to use any app that demands that kind of big brothery ""oh but it is so we can personalise your experience (but also gather humungous amounts of data mwahahaha)"" behaviour! I think my main query was whether they are ALLOWED to withhold the refund, as they have already agreed in writing to process it.

Yet, JP's max has been 33, and WW is 25. So even if we took the best of each 4 regions from any machines, NA 57 + EU 55 + JP 33 + WW 26 that is roughly 170 million. Predicting Switch sells 200 million is insanely high, and yeah I know an iPhone can sell a couple hundred million in a year, but damn, Switch just ain't gonna put 1 in each hand at $300. Click to expand... I agree. I am sure however there will be drastic price drops in the future, time will tell, but for sure in 2019. It could be that Nintendo releases a new SKU this year, which I didnt think of till the update came. Even then though, without a price drop for Christmas, it will be 25 million this fiscal year even with smash and pokemon. But forget phone comparisons, it is an apples to oranges comparison, one is almost a necessity and the other is a toy. I personally always felt Switch would easily break 20 million in Japan, and maybe could be best selling device in JP history, selling like 40 million. And I wouldn't be shocked if they sold 40 million in NA, plenty of machines have done that, but I just don't see EU and WW numbers getting that high, and NA and JP would have to compensate, and even if EU and WW do break records, NA and JP would still have to compensate on top to get to 200. Nintendo easily has 70 million fans willing to buy product, biggest thing they can do is get 1 person to buy a 2nd one with a refresh but I just don't see the same collectors edition thing happening on Switch like with 3DS where people own like 5 of them to have different styles, not when Joy Cons are for that, I see 200 million Joy Cons being sold. But I just don't see the whole 1 switch per kid/person unless they do a major refresh and kid brother gets the old Switch, not that buying 1 for each kid at Christmas. 1 time in my childhood anything remotely happen, when I got a GBC and my sister got a Tiger Game.com...and even her household has like 4-5 3DS's, they never went out and bought 2 at a time. Click to expand... I dont see how you cant see households with multiple Switches with different styles, it is already here. Some people already have a grey and another colored joycon Switch to differentiate them. I think I'd predict +100 million, IF: Click to expand... -No one else releases a handheld. Nvidia Shield Tablet 2 would be really interesting. Xbox's cloud and service gaming is interesting. And PlayStation's Now service can get interesting, as would a new handheld. Click to expand... The only competition I could see to Nintendo's handheld space is Apple entering the ring with a more focused all in one handheld phone gaming system. -Started selling just the Switch with no dock for $200 and packed in Splatoon 2/Odyssey/or other newer games. Click to expand... I can see that sooner than you think. -They can keep up with demand all the time, not the constant inventory issues Click to expand... Nintendo has new partners for hardware manufacturing instead of only having just one now. They wont have issues in the future unless they start selling over 30 million a year. I forsee comparison videos about the different Switch models with different parts. -Switch has a full mid-gen upgrade refresh Click to expand... It seems that is coming this year or the next. -Switch is in market for more than 6 years, I want to say 8-10 Click to expand... Highly likely. If the 3DS is anything to go by, Nintendo will support it for a few more years after they come up with a new system. -The market for Steam indies in handheld is a bigger market than I've always thought and people buy Switch just for indies Click to expand... There are people who are already doing this, but at best they will make up like 5% of the switch population, ie buy switch mainly for indies. -Nindies starts publishing games for indie devs lto get more exclusivity with Steam with no PS4/Xbox Click to expand... Eh? Why would they need to do that? The switch is already a preferred system for indies over the PS4 and Xbox. -Nintendo goes crazy developing a crap ton of games for every gamer, like no stone unturned, hype every year for 6+ years. Click to expand... Define crap ton? I see Nintendo more than doubling their output since they seem to be almost doubling it now with all the outsourcing they are doing now.",,Thesuffering,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I played it on PSNow as well and I'd say pull up a list of the trophies as there is one for every level in the game. It gives you the level name before you start, so you can easily find which trophy you are going for and what the objective is. Nearly all the trophies can be obtained on the first attempt. Only one trophy is completely based on chance (a certain item has to show up), so that trophy took me the longest, but still only took 4-5 tries. My other advice is in regards to how games are unlocked in free play mode - you have to start the first game in the set, then after you finish it, choose ""Play next."" It took me awhile to figure out this is how the games are unlocked. I found forums with other people also wondering how to unlock the games in free play mode, so this seems like a common problem.

Microsoft creates a new gaming cloud division to look at a future beyond Xbox- Technology News, Firstpost





Microsoft has set up a new cloud gaming division in the company to look forward to a future where its gaming strategy does not revolve around Xbox.

A window reflecting a nearby building at the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US. Reuters.

If you are living under a rock or suddenly happen to read this article out of the blue then the Xbox is Microsoft’s gaming console that is geared both towards gaming as well as living-room entertainment.

Currently, the innovation efforts from both the console makers or companies that focus on gaming PCs and the game developers are focused to make better-looking games, to make dedicated gaming devices (PCs and Consoles) more powerful while pushing for portability when it comes to hand-held devices (Nintendo Switch). Microsoft has been planning to move in a direction where the device does not matter and the gaming experience stays similar regardless of how powerful or portable the device is.

Nintendo Switch

According to a report by The Verge, as part of the planning, the company has been acquiring smaller companies that have been working on improving the gaming experience. Some of the acquisitions include Havok, Simplygon and more recently, PlayFab earlier this year. The report points out that these companies are essential to Microsoft’s plans to launch its cloud gaming services.

The newly created cloud gaming division by Microsoft will be headed by 20-year Microsoft veteran Kareem Choudhry. Talking to The Verge, Kareem added, “Phil really wanted a dedicated team focused exclusively on the gaming cloud. Those were conversations that started happening last summer, and we really started creating the structure of the organization at the end of last year.” The company wants to push game developers to use the cloud as more and more games start providing an experience that spans multiple devices.

Microsoft is looking to create something that is like Netflix but for gaming where a subscription will give users access to whatever game they like, on whatever device they want to play the game on. However, Microsoft won’t be the only company with the ambition to offer a game streaming service. Sony tried its hand with PlayStation Now and Nvidia is also offering its gaming streaming service in the form of GeForce Now. This service is a difficult nut to crack while maintaining the quality and ease of use. However, Microsoft seems to be determined to offer this service in three years. Till then, it has a long way to go from getting the technology right to attracting gamers and game developers to the service.

You play Oliver, whose mother dies. In the depths of despair, you happen to meet this weird lamp creature who reveals you that there's a parallel world that is connected to our own and we all have a sort of ""other self"" that we're sort of spiritually connected to. Anyway, Oliver goes to that other world in an attempt to revive his mother or something by helping out the ""other self"" of his mother, who's this fancy magician witch lady who seems to have disappeared or whatever. There's also sages and kings and councils and pokemon and stuff, but they're not important. Anyway, there are 2 villains in this game. There's an emo soldier dude who turned evil because bad stuff happened to him and twisted his personality. Then, there's the main villain, this masked witch chick who wants to destroy the world to rebuild a new one because bad stuff happened to her and she doesn't like the world because of some pretty immature and stupid reasons. Anyway, basically, Oliver learns magic and gets strong and stuff because reasons and he eventually confronts the witch at the end and she realizes that she's wrong but this evil spirit thing comes out of her and you need to beat them and then, after that, the evil witch turns into a nice lady. You go back to your world, your mom's still dead, and nothing that happened really amounted to much. The end. I've been hearing from a lot of different media outlets that this game is really good, but I'm going to wait for reviews/more people's opinions about it to come out. I bought into the hype for the first game and ended up not liking it very much. I still finished it since I paid like, 50 bucks for it, but yea.

And I bet a boatload of folk who are playing the game emulated do not own the game legally. I'd go as far as saying most folk who are playing it on an emulator torrented it. And I said the streaming service isn't an official PC release. Can I go in and fiddle around with PC settings? Or is it basically just a straight PS3 game and you just plug in a controller and that's what you're stuck with? I mean going by that logic I could plug in my PS3 into a capture card on my PC and say ""LOOK! I'm playing Demon Souls on my PC! And I bought if officially so it's an official PC version!"" And I have to care about other people pirating because... no, I don't. People are currently pirating games that are on pc available, so that's not an argument, is it? You boot up your pc. You use your desired controller, like me, an xbox360. You boot up psnow. You play Demon's Souls. If you keep on telling me that's not playing DeS on pc, then I can't argue with you.

Who knows, there is a reasonable chance that streaming games might become a standart unless you can still afford hardware and games. Just look at current hardware prices, I sure wouldn't wanna build a pc from scratch right now. Streaming games becoming standard...god I hope not. I like to buy my games and actually have them on my machine, so I can still play them when Australia's horrible internet infrastructure drops. I don't think Australia would be able to handle streaming for a looooong time. And actually, an official PC release would be a port, not a streaming service. Like I said, if streaming is considered an official PC release I could plug my PS3 into a TV capture card and go ""Look! I'm playing an official PC release of Demon's Souls!""

Might want to get a PS4. I know, I know, PS4 slim is $379 but there are frequently sales if you shop around, RFD, kijiji, etc. Bed Bath and Beyond had a Black Friday deal on PS4 for $229. It happens. yes this is absolutely a good point, that crossed my mind too. ====================::==================== Quote: : ↑ Mar 16th, 2018 3:51 pm yes this is absolutely a good point, that crossed my mind too. I think it's your best bet dude. Look at it this way: 1) You already seem to have a means of accessing forums and I assume netflix, youtube, etc 2)PS4 can do all that stuff too (has web browser) 3)For $300, the box you will end up with will have WORSE performance than a PS4 4)The PS4 is new and comes with a warranty. Used parts are used, no warranty, and could be flaky or become flaky very soon 5)PS4 guarantees that you can run any PS4 game properly now and for the next couple of years 6)You can visit pornhub on a PS4 Xbox One is also an option. I have a gaming PC, Xbox One S and PS4 Pro. The playstation is by far the better games system in terms of exclusive games and the fact that multiplatform games run better on it. But the Xbox is always available cheaper. Xbox has a better web browser, and a more pleasing user interface. But if games are what really matter, get the playstation. If you still want the used PC, there are places you can go like Uniway Computer in Oshawa, who have cheap used machines. Maybe pick up an old i5 based machine, pick up a 500 series Nvidia card or a 6000 or 7000 series AMD card for peanuts, slap it in there, play games until the thing catches on fire... I just don't recommend it. Honestly I've got a GTX 1080 and a 144Hz monitor and I STILL prefer to play games on my PS4 pro. When you make a pimp decision and get the PS4, PM me and I'll give you my gamertag. We can suck at fortnite together. It's free. Or if you get the Xbox we can play on that. Xbox is $319+1 free game for a 1TB console right now Pros and Cons PS4 vs Xbox vs PC Xbox: +Works with pornhub +Best controller design +Game Pass is fantastic +Cheaper initial cost +""Play anywhere games"" where you buy once on Xbox/PC and can play the game on both Xbox and PC +Excellent operating system +Plays 4K Bluray +Superior online games service that is down less than playstation's -Inferior horsepower vs PS4 slim due to using DDR3 vs DDR5 -Multiplatform games don't look as good as on PS4 -Inferior selection of inferior first party games Playstation +Works with pornhub +Superior selection of excellent first party games +Higher horsepower thanks to DDR5 +Smaller overall console +Multiplatform games look better vs Xbox -Not a very comfortable controller to hold in the hands -PSNow is inferior (vastly) to Gamepass and costs more -Playstation network is frequently down. Seems to happen every 10 days or so. It's pretty damn bad. -Not a very elegant operating system -Costs more than Xbox PC +Widest selection of games on any platform, ever. +Ability to run virtual machines, emulators, etc, ever increasing your game library capabilities +It's a PC! It does PC stuff! +Works with Pornhub +Mouse+Keyboard is better for a lot of game types +Cheap games! So many cheap games... and so many places competing to sell them to you. You win! +Modular parts. If your power supply dies, you can just replace it for $50 or so (or a lot less if you want to play with fire). -Costs WAY more than a console -Can get viruses/malware -Mouse+keyboard mean everyone else is better at the game too. You'll probably die more -Possible incompatibility problems -All the bad things that can go wrong with a PC (long list) -Hardware doesn't stay current as long (A PS4 bought in 2013 will play PS4 games perfectly in 2019.

How is an official streaming service from Sony where you could play Demon Souls on not an official release? Who cares if you bought the the game retail, digital, or if you stream it, as long as it is on pc? Aren't we talking about playing DeS on pc? If you argue about ""releasing"" in retail or digital shelf, then that's just avoiding the fact that I stated about playstation now. It's about playing on pc, isn't it? There is nothing dodgy about owning a game and making yourself a rom out of it. Me saying dude was just being polite. And I bet a boatload of folk who are playing the game emulated do not own the game legally. I'd go as far as saying most folk who are playing it on an emulator torrented it. And I said the streaming service isn't an official PC release. Can I go in and fiddle around with PC settings? Or is it basically just a straight PS3 game and you just plug in a controller and that's what you're stuck with? I mean going by that logic I could plug in my PS3 into a capture card on my PC and say ""LOOK! I'm playing Demon Souls on my PC! And I bought if officially so it's an official PC version!"" And I have to care about other people pirating because... no, I don't. People are currently pirating games that are on pc available, so that's not an argument, is it? You boot up your pc. You use your desired controller, like me, an xbox360. You boot up psnow. You play Demon's Souls. If you keep on telling me that's not playing DeS on pc, then I can't argue with you.

It’s $20 a month which is kinda a lot if you’re just going to play RDR, but if you don’t have a PS3 or your PS3 doesn’t work, it’s almost worth it.

Other than RDR, though, there are other titles from PS2 and PS3 as well, which I’ve thought about renewing so I can play those.

I have Steam GOTY Edition. It ran Vanilla with compatibility tweaks (ran compatible with XP SP3). Also, installed FOSE with compatibility, upped the .exe to 4 GB and set affinity for game at 2 cores. It ran even better seemed more stable. I also Installed Unofficial Patch. Okay now for MODS.; Fellout-Full, Enhanced Blood, Flora Overhaul, Colt M4 Carbines, GNR Enhanced, AKS74U, MMMFO, Sprint Mod, DC Interiors, Real World Drinks, Hi Res Weapons and the NMC Large Texture Pack. I had more loaded but it would crash shortly after execution (if it would even execute) so I scaled down my MOD selection. To my shock and surprise the game executed and loaded. 30 hours I had spent trying and troubleshooting. I was able to start a New Game. Played for several hours with only one crash. I got to Megaton (crashed again as I exited the vault but loaded save and worked swell thereafter for a while). I was so stoked, I had never seen FO3 like this I played it 10 years ago on console and never dreamed how good it could look now that I have a gaming CPU. I have an Alienware 15, getting a little long in the tooth in 2018 but it was smoking FO3. I did my thing at Megaton and played around with some console commands still chugging along. Then... I leave Megaton heading north and every time I get just beyond Sunnyvale, where you can see the large overpass it goes kaput. Only thing I can think is maybe Fellout or the NMC pack is adding in to much detail and I am running the game on ultra high settings. I played around with it a bit still no luck. I really don't want to lose Fellout mod it looks so amazing. IDK, if any of you friends read this and know something I haven't tried (and yes I have rifled through the forums and threads or as much as I could and still no dice) save me from having to play FO3 on ...gulp...

As The Verge reports, it's something Microsoft been building up for a while with the acquisition of small companies like PlayFab, which is focused on game development in the cloud. The company also has the basic structure of what a cloud streaming offering could look like with Xbox Game Pass, its subscription service that gives players access to large library of games for $10 a month. While early attempts at game streaming have crashed and burned, like OnLive, it's still an intriguing market. Sony's PlayStation Now service is still alive and kicking on the PS4 and PC, and NVIDIA is doubling down on game streaming with GeForce Now. The latter is still just a beta test though -- even the graphics card giant hasn't figured out how to charge for high-end game streaming. Microsoft isn't saying much about what the new gaming cloud division is working on yet, but its leader, Kareem Choudhry, hints that they're exploring ways to bring content to gamers on any device.",,StyM,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Microsoft forms a new gaming cloud division,,,

I have Steam GOTY Edition. It ran Vanilla with compatibility tweaks (ran compatible with XP SP3). Also, installed FOSE with compatibility, upped the .exe to 4 GB and set affinity for game at 2 cores. It ran even better seemed more stable. I also Installed Unofficial Patch. Okay now for MODS.; Fellout-Full, Enhanced Blood, Flora Overhaul, Colt M4 Carbines, GNR Enhanced, AKS74U, MMMFO, Sprint Mod, DC Interiors, Real World Drinks, Hi Res Weapons and the NMC Large Texture Pack. I had more loaded but it would crash shortly after execution (if it would even execute) so I scaled down my MOD selection. To my shock and surprise the game executed and loaded. 30 hours I had spent trying and troubleshooting. I was able to start a New Game. Played for several hours with only one crash. I got to Megaton (crashed again as I exited the vault but loaded save and worked swell thereafter for a while). I was so stoked, I had never seen FO3 like this I played it 10 years ago on console and never dreamed how good it could look now that I have a gaming CPU. I have an Alienware 15, getting a little long in the tooth in 2018 but it was smoking FO3. I did my thing at Megaton and played around with some console commands still chugging along. Then... I leave Megaton heading north and every time I get just beyond Sunnyvale, where you can see the large overpass it goes kaput. Only thing I can think is maybe Fellout or the NMC pack is adding in to much detail and I am running the game on ultra high settings. I played around with it a bit still no luck. I really don't want to lose Fellout mod it looks so amazing. IDK, if any of you friends read this and know something I haven't tried (and yes I have rifled through the forums and threads or as much as I could and still no dice) save me from having to play FO3 on ...gulp... PSNow . Oh the graphics are shhait and interface even worse. If you have read this far thanks much obliged.

Microsoft quietly announced the introduction of an upcoming cloud gaming service. The move will allow the company to eventually begin streaming games-on-demand, much like Sony’s PlayStation Now functionality for the PC and PlayStation 4. The aim of the feature would be to give gamers access to games anytime with the ability to stream titles from an expansive digital collection of games. Currently, the Xbox Game Pass allows Xbox One gamers to choose from over 100 titles for $10 USD per month, while the cloud gaming proponent would grant access on a variety of outlets beyond Microsoft’s current flagship system.

Stay tuned for more information on Microsoft’s latest venture. Recently, Microsoft’s Bill Gates stated that cryptocurrency is causing deaths “in a fairly direct way.”

You play Oliver, whose mother dies. In the depths of despair, you happen to meet this weird lamp creature who reveals you that there's a parallel world that is connected to our own and we all have a sort of ""other self"" that we're sort of spiritually connected to. Anyway, Oliver goes to that other world in an attempt to revive his mother or something by helping out the ""other self"" of his mother, who's this fancy magician witch lady who seems to have disappeared or whatever. There's also sages and kings and councils and pokemon and stuff, but they're not important. Anyway, there are 2 villains in this game. There's an emo soldier dude who turned evil because bad stuff happened to him and twisted his personality. Then, there's the main villain, this masked witch chick who wants to destroy the world to rebuild a new one because bad stuff happened to her and she doesn't like the world because of some pretty immature and stupid reasons. Anyway, basically, Oliver learns magic and gets strong and stuff because reasons and he eventually confronts the witch at the end and she realizes that she's wrong but this evil spirit thing comes out of her and you need to beat them and then, after that, the evil witch turns into a nice lady. You go back to your world, your mom's still dead, and nothing that happened really amounted to much. The end. I've been hearing from a lot of different media outlets that this game is really good, but I'm going to wait for reviews/more people's opinions about it to come out. I bought into the hype for the first game and ended up not liking it very much. I still finished it since I paid like, 50 bucks for it, but yea. I disagree that nothing happened, oliver learned to deal with grief and accept that he had to get on with this life even after his mom died, he was crying for days before the adventure began.

I'll tinker with it tomorrow with your suggestions in mind and see if I cant get it stabilized. Much obliged... off topic but glad I decided to dust off this machine and give PC gaming a go again. I've been a console guy primarily only dabbling in PC gaming. I bought this laptop because I got a good deal on it at the time but retired it about a year ago in favor of a mac (I was mostly using it for internet, word processing and light gaming stuff a mac might do better). When the launcher told me I could only run FO4 on low settings thought it would be a bummer but gave it a shot and WOW!!!! Even on this 3 year old machine with a lesser hardware capability than my PS4 Pro and the graphics, texture, just everything is like unbelievable. Twice as good as any console. I may be a PC gamer for life. I would rather shell out $1000 bucks for a half decent machine to game on than buy another console. So much more freedom and customization possibilities. Anyone want to buy a PS4 Pro?? I'm a keyboard jockey now man. Its crazy they build these consoles with all this tricked out hardware and its now abundantly apparent you don't get what you pay for because for what ever reason they are not or cant utilize the full potential of the Processor, GPU, none of it. Anyways, I just had to share that and my wife hate when I tell her about gaming. Thanks so much again.",,RehabJip,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,I'm tired and just wanna play?

You can have a home console that has a base where you put in the handheld console and the base generate the power. At this point it's going to be PS5 vs Switch. Sony is not dumb they know this is the gaming everyone wants. People want options to pick up their game and go. If you don't like that then you can easily just leave the handheld in the base and never take it out. I'm sorry I want Sony on the go gaming. Can you imagine being able to play ps4 games on the go? Sure they won't be full HD but they will be playable. Sony said they have to be aware of Nintendo for next gen, it's only because Switch sales seems to be gearing up to take second place this gen, yet, I don't think Sony means that they would venture in Nintendo type hardware or even a handheld......I think their focus on next gen will be services, so they will improve PSNOW, they will improve remote/share play so you can play your titles on your mobile, though they're already doing that or did that this gen. I think also they will be poised to really make VR take off to the mainstream, it's a relatively good market for them this gen, but with potential hardware to give us 4k 120fps or 240fps vr games, that's an avenue for some very nicelooking vr games and a runaway hit that will get everyone talking and wanting to play VR......Something like Forttnite with a Drake PUSH ontop.....",,thelastword,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

As for game pricing, Sony Europe are awful when it comes to appropriate pricing. In the UK they launch at a much higher price than the US, regular sales routinely only bring the price down to the US launch price and game prices don't decay over time like they do in the US. Granted special sales like January, Summer, Halloween and Christmas give some great deals, but would that continue in the monopoly situation of backwards compatibility? Given that currently the only way to play PS3 games on PS4 is via PSNow and that costs £130 per year compared the $99 it costs in the US I doubt it.",,-Murton-,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Xbox One S / Xbox One X Price: $250 or $500 Pros: Cheapish now $10 monthly subscription for many good games available (good starting point) Games you buy and Game Pass can be/are cross-compatible if you choose to buy a PC later Easy availability, no tinkering, plug and play style. Cons: Definite lifespan Games will generally be more expensive than pc Monthly to Yearly subscription required to play online Online community is widely considered as bad Exclusives: Microsoft has finally realized that PC gaming isn't a market to fear and has integrated their Xbox and Windows Gaming platforms together. Because of this, Xbox (to my knowledge) has no exclusives that a PC can't play. Overview With the Xbox One, you're afforded two options; the cheaper S version, or the more expensive X version. This is essentially the same as choosing between an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 Plus. One's a standard Xbox, capable of playing any game you put in it, while the other is basically the same thing but a bit stronger. The image quality is better, it runs faster, it has more storage, and it's more expensive. It's been about four years since the original Xbox One was released, and the previous gap between Xbox's was eight years, so my guess is you'll get, like, another five or six years before you'll have to buy the new Xbox to keep playing new games. Who knows if they'll be backwards compatible. There are also some benefits and drawbacks to the Xbox/Microsoft ecosystem. Games in general will cost much more than you'll find on PC, normally with the standard $60 price tag or higher. There are game stops or eBay, but some developers even claim that buying used games is worse than pirating them (Destructoid). Granted this is a moral dilemma and you may decide that it doesn't bother you. In that case, go for it. On top of that, there is also the Xbox Game Pass, which is a monthly subscription for $10 (with a two week free trial) to play a lot of games. This includes Halo 5, Gears of War, Terraria, Mad Max, and Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons (this is good for two people to play on one controller, may be good for you and your SO) among others. This game pass is also valid for Windows 10 PCs as well, and is a pretty good deal in my opinion. As I mentioned, many titles are now also cross-compatible with Windows 10. This means any game you buy on the Xbox with ""Play Anywhere"" functionality can also be downloaded and played on your PC if you ever decide to get one. On the downside, however, online functionality for the Xbox is also a paid premium. This would be a monthly (or quarterly, biannually, or annually) subscription through an Xbox Live membership, which is anywhere from $10/month to $60/year. PS4 / PS4 Pro Price: $300 or $400 Pros: Cheaper than Xbox at top-tier $20 monthly subscription available for many games (Playstation Now) Easy availability, no tinkering, plug and play style. Cons: Games will generally be as expensive as Xbox Playstation Now (Sony's equivalent of Game Pass) is a streaming service, meaning you're playing a game being run on another PS4 somewhere else that's sending you the image. If your internet isn't above average, this will probably suffer and lag. I believe there are also waiting times for open systems. Definite lifespan Monthly to Yearly subscription required to play online Online community is generally considered a bit better than Xbox to my knowledge Exclusives: Uncharted series The Last of Us Horizon: Zero Dawn Until Dawn Yakuza The Last Guardian Overview There isn't really all the much to say that hasn't already been said about Xbox. It's essentially the same kind of ecosystem but with more exclusive games. These are technically available on PC through the Playstation Now streaming feature, but it's not local and is prone to problems if your internet isn't great. However, I definitely recommend playing The Last of Us, and I encourage you to not look it up before playing. It's entirely a single-player story driven game and you could easily pass it within the time of the free trial for Playstation Now if you wanted. Nintendo Switch Price: $300 Pros: Cheapest system Portable; primarily a tablet Nintendo (Good for family) Dockable, can be used on TV like other consoles Cons: Screen has an issue with glare Internal storage isn't very large - if you plan on downloading games, plan on buying MicroSD cards. Exclusives: Splatoon 2 Super Mario Odessey Arms 1-2-Switch Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Mario + Rabbids Kirby Star Allies Newly announced Super Smash Brothers Overview It's Nintendo. Windows 10 PC Price: $800 - $2,000 Pros: Games are much cheaper, saving money in the long run Availability of option Modular Upgradability, you don't have to rebuy the entire system (IMO) The best gaming experience Cons: Current market for parts is expensive (Dram shortage means RAM that used to be $80 is now $200) Upgrading requires knowledge of what is compatible with eachother Easily the most expensive out of the box, also requiring a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and headphones if you don't already have some. Very fiddly to get working well - messing with settings is almost a must (though programs like Nvidia Experience will do this for you) Overview I might be biased, but PC is irrefutably the most custom, up-gradable, all-around experience there is and, as such, the price fluctuates a lot. With how things are right now, the cheapest you could get an okay ""current-generation"" gaming PC right now is around $800, though I wouldn't set your mind on being as cheap as possible. PC hardware comes and goes relatively quickly which leaves old hardware (which is still perfectly capable of handing brand new games) cheaper. As an example, I have a 4th generation CPU released in 2014 that still works perfectly fine while the 8th generation just launched at the end of last year. However because of that the cheaper you are now, the quicker you'll have to upgrade later. Not all PC parts are equal, either, and in my opinion it's a bit much to learn for your first PC build, so I'd recommend getting someone to help you pick parts that will work together and work well. If you're not comfortable with watching a video and doing it yourself, I also recommend getting someone to help build it with you, or even buying a PC pre-built (though this will add a bit of extra cost). If you want to play on the TV as well, you can also invest in a Steam Link, which you plug in to your TV and wired internet and will use your PC to run the game and stream the image over your local internet to the TV. I believe you can test how well this would work somewhere within steam before buying the Link, but I forget where. Now that that's out of the way, you can use the same $10/month Game Pass subscription from Xbox for the same games from the Windows Store. As I stated before, there are some phenomenal games here in my opinion and I think this is a great place to start. Xbox controllers also work natively with Windows 10. Personal Note: Phew. I just want to add that if you want to get a PC but are unsure of how to build or set it up, I'd be happy to help you out. Hell, if you want me to build it for you and ship it out I have a GTX 960 I recently upgraded from that needs a new home. Sorry this is so long winded but I believe it should be mostly accurate and I hope it helps.",,Mintalicious420,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Microsoft Teases ‘Biggest Showing Ever’ For E3 2018: Is This The Year Of The Xbox One?



Five things to know about the Xbox One X

Microsoft teased that it will have its “biggest showing ever” in the upcoming E3 2018. What does the company have planned for the annual event, and what could we expect for the Xbox One?  ( Xbox Wire )

Microsoft is gearing up for its “biggest showing ever” at the upcoming E3 2018, as the company revealed its plans for the Xbox One at the annual video game event.

The Xbox One has long lagged behind the PlayStation 4, but the release of the Nintendo Switch as the third major player in the video game console wars has invigorated the industry. Will this finally be the year for the Xbox One to come out on top?

Microsoft At E3 2018

Xbox VP and chief marketing officer Mike Nichols revealed through an official Xbox Wire post that Microsoft “saw an opportunity to create an entirely new show experience” for E3 2018, which will be held from June 12 to June 14 in Los Angeles.

Microsoft collaborated with E3 organizer Entertainment Software Association to bring its presence at the event across the street. While E3 2018 will be at the Los Angeles Convention Center, Microsoft will be holding its show at the Microsoft Theater.

The Microsoft Theater will host all Microsoft’s official E3 events, including the Xbox E3 2018 Briefing on June 10 before E3 2018 kicks off, the Xbox FanFest activities, and hands-on gameplay for upcoming titles. The events will likely also be streamed on various platforms.

Microsoft, however, will still be present at the LACC, with a booth dedicated to Mixer that will provide attendees with E3 news and the chance to play with certain Xbox One games. The booth will also likely be reminding people that Microsoft’s E3 events are across the street.

E3 2018 will likely grow even bigger, as it will again be open to the public and will have extended hours. With the move to the Microsoft Theater, Microsoft will potentially have bigger audiences for its presentations.

What To Expect For Xbox One At E3 2018

The Xbox One was off to a great start this year. While the console was behind the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in terms of sales, the Xbox One had its best January ever, fueled by the Xbox One X. Is this a sign for many more good things to come for the console?

Microsoft laid out its plans for E3 2018, but the company did not give a clue on what exactly will be announced at the annual event.

One possibility is that Microsoft will finally announce the long-awaited Halo 6, which may be what the Xbox One needs to go head-to-head with the exclusives for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. There are also rumors that a new Fable game is in the works, Forza Horizon 4 may make an appearance, and Microsoft is developing a game streaming service similar to PlayStation Now.

I can say that I have probably only completed 2 games in the last 12 months. I feel like I get choice fatigue over choosing what to play of my 2k+ games that I own... spread amongst PC, 3DS, Switch, and PS4. I start a game and stick to it for several hours and then some how I drift away and don't come back to it until a long time later. Then I start over again because I don't remember where I am and end up losing interest again! I felt like posting this, because it happened just these last few weeks. I went from playing Breath of the Wild for like 20 hours straight... to going to 20 hours of Horizon Zero Dawn, to starting up God of War on PSNow for like 4 hours, then 10 hours of Bloodborne and now I'm 2 hours into Catherine on PSNow and side playing The Witness at the same time. I know I'm not going to finish any of these games. What is working for others to focus on a single game until finishing it? Or is drifting between all just as satisfying for some, as it is to finish a game?

As a PC gamer you can play many PS2 and Nintendo games via emulators and PS3 and PS4 games via the PSNow streaming service.

However after Security Update KB4088776 installed and restarted last night I get the following error in my event log for my controller (OneDrive link to event log file): https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnqIyN3Em9CSnX0mRkj-u3L-56HE It's mostly ""Device was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match."" or ""Device had a problem starting."" Service: sixaxis Problem: 0xA Problem Status: 0xC0000001 After the KB installed none of my USB drivers worked properly including my mouse (Razor Ouroboros) and keyboard (Logitech G910). I had to fish out a USB to PS2 converter and then plug that into a PS2 to USB converter to get windows to load basic keyboard drivers and get logged in. After that I was able to reinstall every single USB device and get them working again except for my DS3 controller. If the DS3 controller is plugged in when I try to update/uninstall the driver, use USBDeview, restart the computer, shutdown the computer, or when I click to open the log-in screen the process/task/service will freeze indefinitely (waited 2-hrs for a driver uninstall). The fix for this is to unplug the device, as soon as I do the process will finish like nothing ever went wrong and will return success values. I am then able to plug the DS3 controller back in with no more process hang-ups. I gone into regedit to verify the correct path is being used for the inf and driver file under hkey_local_machine and current_user after the installs/uninstalls and it looks like everything is behaving like it should, I'm no registry expert but if you give me a path I can get a copy of the registry values. I have attempted to uninstall the Security Update KB4088776 but despite seeing 100% completion and success after restarting I am still able to see the KB installed and the odd behavior with the DS3 controller persists. I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling driver and KB in safe mode, trying different drivers including motionjoy, SCP-DS3-Driver-Package, Xbox360 controller drivers, disabling diver signature enforcement, manually changing registry values for the driver and testing, then restoring from backup if they failed (they all failed...) The only options I'm seeing left to get this last USB device working is to wipe and reinstall windows, which is a bit insane considering I have no guarantee that this patch won't reinstall it self and ruin everything all over again considering how impossible it is to block windows updates now unless you remove it from the internet.

Microsoft forms a new cloud gaming division It's a big sign that game streaming is headed to the Xbox. Devindra Hardawar, @devindra 2h ago in Gadgetry With little fanfare, Microsoft has announced that it's launching a new gaming cloud division, a move that would set the company up to enter the world of game streaming. As The Verge reports, it's something Microsoft been building up for a while with the acquisition of small companies like PlayFab, which is focused on game development in the cloud. The company also has the basic structure of what a cloud streaming offering could look like with Xbox Game Pass, its subscription service that gives players access to large library of games for $10 a month. While early attempts at game streaming have crashed and burned, like OnLive, it's still an intriguing market. Sony's PlayStation Now service is still alive and kicking on the PS4 and PC, and NVIDIA is doubling down on game streaming with GeForce Now. The latter is still just a beta test though -- even the graphics card giant hasn't figured out how to charge for high-end game streaming. Microsoft isn't saying much about what the new gaming cloud division is working on yet, but its leader, Kareem Choudhry, hints that they're exploring ways to bring content to gamers on any device.",,BeenRetired,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Per your own link: Similar to popular streaming services, PSO2 Cloud captures your character’s input and transmits that data to the Cloud. The results are then displayed on the Nintendo Switch, allowing you to play the game in real-time. Graphics and other game intensive data are handled by the Cloud, making downloading and updating no longer necessary. Due to the nature of the cloud gaming service, the game will be set to 30 fps, and the player might experience delays based on the status of the internet connection. The only thing your Switch is doing is sending your button presses to Sega’s servers. The graphics, sound and everything else are done in their machines, the resulting video of which is sent to your Switch. It’s the same way Sony has been doing PS3 games on PS4 through the PlayStation Now service.

171906711698,3/15/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/171906711698,"Microsoft has officially confirmed its plans for E3 2018. Rather than have its usual presence inside the Los Angeles Convention Center, where E3 takes place, Microsoft is moving the bulk of its efforts across the street to the nearby Microsoft Theater in LA Live. The company says this will make for the company’s “biggest E3 showing ever.”

First up at the Microsoft Theater will be Microsoft’s E3 press conference, which is scheduled to take place on Sunday, June 10, at 1 PM PT. Following that, it will host Xbox FanFest events, hands-on demos for E3 attendees, and more. “Not only does the Microsoft Theater allow us to centralize our Xbox presence at E3, but its size enables us to include even more fans and partners in the Xbox E3 2018 Briefing than ever before,” said corporate VP Mike Nichols in an Xbox Wire post.

The announcement makes it clear that the move was made in collaboration with the ESA, no doubt to avoid spurring discussions about E3’s demise. Microsoft also points out that it won’t be absent entirely from the official E3 show floor, as it will have a booth for its streaming service, Mixer.

“These changes–expanding our presence, multiple venues, taking over the Microsoft Theater–give us the opportunity to bring together a variety of Xbox experiences into one primary location and, most importantly, let fans in on what we’re up to in 2018 and beyond in a fresh new way,” Nichols said.

At this point, we have little idea of what to expect from Microsoft’s E3 showing. Whereas last year we knew that Xbox One X (then Project Scorpio) would be a major highlight, this year’s show remains more of a mystery. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January that there would be some “positive changes” at E3 for Microsoft, which may have been a reference to the just-announced move. One possibility is the announcement of Halo 6, which has been discussed but not formally revealed. Microsoft is also said to be working on a PlayStation Now-like game-streaming service.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"Xbox E3 Press Conference Dated; Microsoft Makes Changes For ""Biggest Showing Ever""",Post,,

I have Steam GOTY Edition. It ran Vanilla with compatibility tweaks (ran compatible with XP SP3). Also, installed FOSE with compatibility, upped the .exe to 4 GB and set affinity for game at 2 cores. It ran even better seemed more stable. I also Installed Unofficial Patch. Okay now for MODS.; Fellout-Full, Enhanced Blood, Flora Overhaul, Colt M4 Carbines, GNR Enhanced, AKS74U, MMMFO, Sprint Mod, DC Interiors, Real World Drinks, Hi Res Weapons and the NMC Large Texture Pack. I had more loaded but it would crash shortly after execution (if it would even execute) so I scaled down my MOD selection. To my shock and surprise the game executed and loaded. 30 hours I had spent trying and troubleshooting. I was able to start a New Game. Played for several hours with only one crash. I got to Megaton (crashed again as I exited the vault but loaded save and worked swell thereafter for a while). I was so stoked, I had never seen FO3 like this I played it 10 years ago on console and never dreamed how good it could look now that I have a gaming CPU. I have an Alienware 15, getting a little long in the tooth in 2018 but it was smoking FO3. I did my thing at Megaton and played around with some console commands still chugging along. Then... I leave Megaton heading north and every time I get just beyond Sunnyvale, where you can see the large overpass it goes kaput. Only thing I can think is maybe Fellout or the NMC pack is adding in to much detail and I am running the game on ultra high settings. I played around with it a bit still no luck. I really don't want to lose Fellout mod it looks so amazing.

Devindra Hardawar, @devindra 2h ago in Gadgetry With little fanfare, Microsoft has announced that it's launching a new gaming cloud division, a move that would set the company up to enter the world of game streaming. As The Verge reports, it's something Microsoft been building up for a while with the acquisition of small companies like PlayFab, which is focused on game development in the cloud. The company also has the basic structure of what a cloud streaming offering could look like with Xbox Game Pass, its subscription service that gives players access to large library of games for $10 a month. While early attempts at game streaming have crashed and burned, like OnLive, it's still an intriguing market. Sony's PlayStation Now service is still alive and kicking on the PS4 and PC, and NVIDIA is doubling down on game streaming with GeForce Now. The latter is still just a beta test though -- even the graphics card giant hasn't figured out how to charge for high-end game streaming. Microsoft isn't saying much about what the new gaming cloud division is working on yet, but its leader, Kareem Choudhry, hints that they're exploring ways to bring content to gamers on any device.",,BeenRetired,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,31527909,,,

The move will allow the company to eventually begin streaming games-on-demand, much like Sony’s PlayStation Now functionality for the PC and PlayStation 4. The aim of the feature would be to give gamers access to games anytime with the ability to stream titles from an expansive digital collection of games. Currently, the Xbox Game Pass allows Xbox One gamers to choose from over 100 titles for $10 USD per month, while the cloud gaming proponent would grant access on a variety of outlets beyond Microsoft’s current flagship system.

Stay tuned for more information on Microsoft’s latest venture. Recently, Microsoft’s Bill Gates stated that cryptocurrency is causing deaths “in a fairly direct way.”

The company was so unpopular back in 2015 that the president of an electronic parts company wanted to be dissociated from the Kyoto-based game maker. ""Please don't call us a Nintendo-related stock anymore,"" the president said at a news conference for an earnings release. Inventories of Nintendo's disappointing Wii U device were building up at the time, leading to cuts in output plans that hurt electronic parts suppliers. But three years later, critics see Nintendo in a completely different light. The Switch, a hybrid game system that serves as both a home console or a handheld, has been flying off the shelves. Its U.S. sales have outpaced those of a popular predecessor, the Wii, encouraging Nintendo to upgrade the sales target twice for the year ending this month. Investors have shown their zeal for Nintendo, whose share price has more than doubled since the release of the Switch about a year ago. The stock's trading volume by value for the nearly concluded fiscal 2017 totaled roughly 25 trillion yen ($236 billion) as of Monday, more than twice the figure for second-place SoftBank Group. This revival compares with the murky outlook for suppliers of electronics company Apple. The U.S. company's top-tier iPhone X has driven consumers away with its lofty price tag. Apple now looks to curb prices by ""putting cost-cutting pressure on parts suppliers,"" said Masamitsu Oki at Fivestar Asset Management. Nintendo buys fewer parts from outside suppliers than Apple, yet is influential enough to lift profits at some electronic parts developers. Shares have skyrocketed 62% for Minebea Mitsumi since the debut of the Switch, as the company is thought to build the device. Hosiden, which also assembles the Switch, and supplier MegaChips have surged more than 30% each. ""The rally of parts suppliers will be followed by that of software publishers,"" predicts an official at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Nintendo has been creating game content mostly on its own, but third-party publishers are set to benefit from the Switch's booming sales. One of the most promising developers is Capcom, whose shares hit a 17-year high Monday on strong earnings and growing hopes tied to planned titles for the Switch. One big question involves whether the fervor for the Switch will be sustainable. Global sales will reach at least 200 million units, about twice as many as for the Wii, according to one estimate. Nintendo sees its operating profit more than quintupling to 160 billion yen this fiscal year. Nintendo seeks to sell consoles even at a loss, with the company more than erasing the red ink through high-margin software. This business model means that profits usually would begin three to four years after releasing a new gaming system. ""It is highly possible that the company earns a record profit in fiscal 2019,"" predicts Hideki Yasuda at Ace Research Institute. Video game sales generally are shielded from the economic cycle. As data at home and abroad hints at an economic slowdown, investors are shying away from blue chips such as banks and electrical machinery manufacturers -- making it even more likely that Nintendo and its suppliers will remain a driving force of the Tokyo market in the near term ====================::==================== If we're talking 200 million, Switch is gonna have to average 50 million among NA, EU, JP and WW, EACH, and the only machines to get a 50 in 1 of the 4 categories was PS2 in NA and EU, and DS in NA and EU, and they were both in the market for over 10 years each. Yet, JP's max has been 33, and WW is 25. So even if we took the best of each 4 regions from any machines, NA 57 + EU 55 + JP 33 + WW 26 that is roughly 170 million. Predicting Switch sells 200 million is insanely high, and yeah I know an iPhone can sell a couple hundred million in a year, but damn, Switch just ain't gonna put 1 in each hand at $300. I personally always felt Switch would easily break 20 million in Japan, and maybe could be best selling device in JP history, selling like 40 million. And I wouldn't be shocked if they sold 40 million in NA, plenty of machines have done that, but I just don't see EU and WW numbers getting that high, and NA and JP would have to compensate, and even if EU and WW do break records, NA and JP would still have to compensate on top to get to 200. Nintendo easily has 70 million fans willing to buy product, biggest thing they can do is get 1 person to buy a 2nd one with a refresh but I just don't see the same collectors edition thing happening on Switch like with 3DS where people own like 5 of them to have different styles, not when Joy Cons are for that, I see 200 million Joy Cons being sold. But I just don't see the whole 1 switch per kid/person unless they do a major refresh and kid brother gets the old Switch, not that buying 1 for each kid at Christmas. 1 time in my childhood anything remotely happen, when I got a GBC and my sister got a Tiger Game.com...and even her household has like 4-5 3DS's, they never went out and bought 2 at a time.

I would like to see a PS5 and PS5 Pro at launch or close to launch. Just like PS4 and PS4 Pro, it will offer great choice. PS4 is an excellent machine, plays all the games, but for people with higher budgets can opt for PS5 Pro. PS4 was a recovery step after Sony struggled a little bit with PS3. But I want Sony to be aggressive on the hardware front with PS5, make it very strong. 4k 60fps would be amazing but, realistically it will be 4k 30fps, because less framerate means better graphics and this is what they always do. The Pro version should be equal or better to the best gaming PC on the market at launch and should be priced around $800-1200, so most people will buy the non pro version, but over time the pro version will come down in price. Not too fussed elsewhere, bit more media functionality would be nice on PS5. Better wifi, and just continue pumping out games.

Playing a dodge copy on an emulator isn't official. And playing via streaming service isn't a PC version either, it's basically playing the game over the internet. It's not a PC version of the game. It's still the PS3 version. I'm not your dude, especially not if you are going to ignore facts. How is an official streaming service from Sony where you could play Demon Souls on not an official release? Who cares if you bought the the game retail, digital, or if you stream it, as long as it is on pc? Aren't we talking about playing DeS on pc? If you argue about ""releasing"" in retail or digital shelf, then that's just avoiding the fact that I stated about playstation now. It's about playing on pc, isn't it? There is nothing dodgy about owning a game and making yourself a rom out of it. Me saying dude was just being polite. And I bet a boatload of folk who are playing the game emulated do not own the game legally. I'd go as far as saying most folk who are playing it on an emulator torrented it. And I said the streaming service isn't an official PC release. Can I go in and fiddle around with PC settings? Or is it basically just a straight PS3 game and you just plug in a controller and that's what you're stuck with? I mean going by that logic I could plug in my PS3 into a capture card on my PC and say ""LOOK! I'm playing Demon Souls on my PC!

If it wasn't for Sony we wouldn't have Bloodborne. Competition breeds innovation and excellence. Exclusivity is the opposite, because you can't complete in that situation. The competitor can't respond. Xbox or PC couldn't make a better platform for the game, or better options for buying, or whatever, because the only way to get access to the game is by having a Playstation. I don't want to deal with console nonsense. It's a sub-optimal way to play games in most cases. Lower framerate, worse processing power, and worse interface. We might not have gotten ""Bloodborne"" without playstation, but we almost certainly would have gotten something BETTER on PC. I have no sympathy for console exclusivity. It's forcing games that would be better on a PC to be tuned-down just in order to work.

 在 OnLive 初期不算順利的嘗試之後，串流遊戲市場後續接連迎來了 Sony（PlayStation Now）、NVIDIA（GeForce Now）這樣的大咖。微軟的加入毫無疑問會把競爭的激烈程度再提升一個等級，而新任雲端遊戲主管 Kareem Choudhry 也表示，他們會嘗試把內容盡可能地帶到玩家的任何裝置之上。 The Verge",,yahoohkstylemen,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,微軟新設了一個雲端遊戲部門,Reblog,,

172115812368,3/21/2018,http://motleyfool-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/172115812368,"Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently launched a dedicated cloud gaming division led by Kareem Choudhry, a 20-year company veteran who previously worked on Outlook, DirectX, and Xbox engineering. Choudhry will report to gaming chief Phil Spencer.

Speaking to The Verge, Choudhry stated that there will eventually be two billion gamers worldwide, and that his unit’s goal was “to reach every one of them.” Let’s take a closer look at these efforts to see if Microsoft can hit that lofty goal.

What is cloud gaming?

Cloud gaming generally refers to two types of technologies. In the first type, a multiplayer game which is installed on a gamer’s PC or console remotely renders certain game assets in the cloud instead of using local hardware.

In Microsoft Studios’ upcoming game Crackdown 3, the destruction of its game world – like bullet holes and explosions – partly relies on the processing power of Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. Therefore, players only witness the full-scale destruction of the game world in multiplayer mode, while the carnage in the campaign mode remains far more limited. Ubisoft’s tactical shooter Rainbow Six: Siege also uses Azure for similar purposes.

The second type is often referred to as “Netflix for video games.” With this technology, an entire game is run off remote servers instead of being downloaded and installed on a PC or console. Technically speaking, a player “remotely controls” a game, and streams the video back to the local hardware. This GaaS (gaming as a service) model provides instant on-demand gaming across multiple devices, but it requires high speed, low latency connections to provide a lag-free gaming experience.

Sony‘s PlayStation Now, which lets players stream PS3 and PS4 games to PS4 consoles and Windows PCs, uses a subscription-based GaaS model. NVIDIA's GeForce Now is another subscription-based GaaS platform that streams high-end PC games to low-end PCs and Shield devices.

What cloud gaming means to Microsoft

Microsoft doesn’t offer a GaaS platform yet. The closest it comes to “game streaming” is the ability to locally stream games from the Xbox One to Windows 10 PCs. This approach, which faces far fewer challenges with latency, is comparable to Sony’s Remote Play and NVIDIA’s GameStream services. It also offers Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service that lets gamers download (not stream) a selection of games to their consoles.

However, Microsoft has been focused on creating a full GaaS platform for several years. Back in 2014, various reports indicated that Microsoft was developing a cloud gaming platform called “DeLorean” that would “predict” a user’s next moves to reduce latency.

In 2015, it acquired 3D gaming physics company Havok. Last year, it bought 3D data-optimization solutions provider Simplygon. Earlier this year, it acquired PlayFab, which provides services for building, launching, and expanding cloud-connected games.

All these moves, capped off with its introduction of a cloud gaming division, indicate that Microsoft will launch a GaaS platform for Xbox One consoles, Windows PCs, and mobile devices in the near future.

But can Microsoft disrupt this niche market?

The cloud gaming market could eventually become another pillar of growth for the company’s commercial cloud business, which grew its revenues 56% annually to $5.3 billion last quarter and accounted for almost a fifth of its top line.

But it would still be a tough uphill battle. In addition to latency issues, Microsoft’s service needs to compete against established players like Sony and NVIDIA. Another looming rival is Amazon, which recently launched more tools for creating cloud-based games that utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS).

All these cloud gaming players must convince gamers that GaaS subscriptions are more cost-efficient than digital downloads or used physical games. PlayStation Now costs $20 per month or $100 per year, and GeForce Now costs $8 per month. This means that Microsoft needs to aim pretty low to gain market share. Microsoft would probably integrate cloud gaming subscriptions into Xbox Game Pass, which costs $10 per month.

The bottom line

Microsoft doesn’t have a great track record with video game frontends. Its Windows-based game store, Games for Windows Live (GFWL), failed to counter Valve’s Steam and was discontinued in 2014.

However, Microsoft is putting the pieces of its cloud gaming strategy together more carefully, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it actually succeeds at creating the elusive “Netflix of video games.”

I think it's your best bet dude. Look at it this way: 1) You already seem to have a means of accessing forums and I assume netflix, youtube, etc 2)PS4 can do all that stuff too (has web browser) 3)For $300, the box you will end up with will have WORSE performance than a PS4 4)The PS4 is new and comes with a warranty. Used parts are used, no warranty, and could be flaky or become flaky very soon 5)PS4 guarantees that you can run any PS4 game properly now and for the next couple of years 6)You can visit pornhub on a PS4 Xbox One is also an option. I have a gaming PC, Xbox One S and PS4 Pro. The playstation is by far the better games system in terms of exclusive games and the fact that multiplatform games run better on it. But the Xbox is always available cheaper. Xbox has a better web browser, and a more pleasing user interface. But if games are what really matter, get the playstation. If you still want the used PC, there are places you can go like Uniway Computer in Oshawa, who have cheap used machines. Maybe pick up an old i5 based machine, pick up a 500 series Nvidia card or a 6000 or 7000 series AMD card for peanuts, slap it in there, play games until the thing catches on fire... I just don't recommend it. Honestly I've got a GTX 1080 and a 144Hz monitor and I STILL prefer to play games on my PS4 pro. When you make a pimp decision and get the PS4, PM me and I'll give you my gamertag. We can suck at fortnite together. It's free. Or if you get the Xbox we can play on that. Xbox is $319+1 free game for a 1TB console right now Pros and Cons PS4 vs Xbox vs PC Xbox: +Works with pornhub +Best controller design +Game Pass is fantastic +Cheaper initial cost +""Play anywhere games"" where you buy once on Xbox/PC and can play the game on both Xbox and PC +Excellent operating system +Plays 4K Bluray +Superior online games service that is down less than playstation's -Inferior horsepower vs PS4 slim due to using DDR3 vs DDR5 -Multiplatform games don't look as good as on PS4 -Inferior selection of inferior first party games Playstation +Works with pornhub +Superior selection of excellent first party games +Higher horsepower thanks to DDR5 +Smaller overall console +Multiplatform games look better vs Xbox -Not a very comfortable controller to hold in the hands -PSNow is inferior (vastly) to Gamepass and costs more -Playstation network is frequently down. Seems to happen every 10 days or so. It's pretty damn bad. -Not a very elegant operating system -Costs more than Xbox PC +Widest selection of games on any platform, ever. +Ability to run virtual machines, emulators, etc, ever increasing your game library capabilities +It's a PC! It does PC stuff! +Works with Pornhub +Mouse+Keyboard is better for a lot of game types +Cheap games! So many cheap games... and so many places competing to sell them to you. You win! +Modular parts. If your power supply dies, you can just replace it for $50 or so (or a lot less if you want to play with fire). -Costs WAY more than a console -Can get viruses/malware -Mouse+keyboard mean everyone else is better at the game too. You'll probably die more -Possible incompatibility problems -All the bad things that can go wrong with a PC (long list) -Hardware doesn't stay current as long (A PS4 bought in 2013 will play PS4 games perfectly in 2019.

171898133561,3/15/2018,http://koschel.tumblr.com/post/171898133561,"With little fanfare, Microsoft has announced that it’s launching a new gaming cloud division, a move that would set the company up to enter the world of game streaming. As The Verge reports, it’s something Microsoft been building up for a while with the acquisition of small companies like PlayFab, which is focused on game development in the cloud. The company also has the basic structure of what a cloud streaming offering could look like with Xbox Game Pass, its subscription service that gives players access to large library of games for $10 a month.

While early attempts at game streaming have crashed and burned, like OnLive, it’s still an intriguing market. Sony’s PlayStation Now service is still alive and kicking on the PS4 and PC, and NVIDIA is doubling down on game streaming with GeForce Now. The latter is still just a beta test though – even the graphics card giant hasn’t figured out how to charge for high-end game streaming. Microsoft isn’t saying much about what the new gaming cloud division is working on yet, but its leader, Kareem Choudhry, hints that they’re exploring ways to bring content to gamers on any device.

Before anyone says something to the effect of ""Payday2 has the original levels""- I understand however, the new game lacks the original game mechanics. Like most people who upgraded to the new baked potato systems, we no longer have the PS3 or XBox360 systems. The game is (pretty much) finished as far as patches go. There would be no need to do anything except send it out to our respective digital stores for redistribution. PAYDAY: The Heist was the SH%T. I think the other Veteran players would agree. Sure, the PC got one last patch that removed the bag glitch and added a few enemies is various maps. If they wanted to include the final version of the game, that'd be great. Otherwise, I'd be okay with just getting the game again in any form. PDTH was so much more competitive and a re-release to the newer systems would bring the console veterans back as well as introduce NEW players to this franchise. The Heist, in comparison to 2 is more easier to just hop in a game and go rob something by yourself or with friends. It's not as intimidating to look at for *new players. Thoughts? ====================::==================== You are comparing apples to potatoes, genius. Ofcourse you would have to use a controller.. We're talking about consoles. I own the game on PS3 & PC. I also bought Payday 2 on Ps3 PS4 and PC. Spending an extra 30 bucks won't kill anyone. That's if they even want to charge for the game at this point being as dated as it is. Just to make it free would make them money by introducing new players that are not ready for the menu-based style of gameplay that PD2 has to offer. You are speaking hypothetically as if there is no fan base for PDTH on consoles. Get real. You have NO clue how big the playerbase was because you were not part of it. I was. The game was once available on Playstation Now as a 10 day trial or something. So, it was able to be streamed. Albeit a lower resolution and framerate. It was still there.",,«[ TGH ]» 9ine,United States of America,,,Neutral,Unclassified,Forums,,,,,PDTH for PS4/XB1? (Trying to build community support for current gen console re-release.),,,

My free trail ran out on PSNow and I then purchased the game on sale this week and found that when restarting my game I unlocked it after the second chapter.

Has this happened to anyone else? ====================::==================== 12 hours ago, Hatteii said: I thought it was weird too, but you can see when I went back and did Happy Birthday (a trophy I missed on PSNow) it unlocked - this was after I purchased the game. I only started to unlock trophies after Good Father so I wonder if that is the reason why I didn’t pop Interactive Drama or it is because I was essentially just streaming from PSNow.

I might get the upcoming PS5 if it has back compatibility. For this gen though, I think the Xbox One X is a much better console alternative. The PS4's lack of back compatibility is a major drawback. BTW, I am just responding to the PS4 fanboys here who do nothing but attack me for choosing the Xbox One X. Otherwise I am okay with whatever console you prefer and don't even bring it up. Maybe you should accuse them of shilling for Sony. Sure I do point why I feel the Xbox One X is the better console for this gen but at least I try to be logical and civil in my response unlike many on the other side. I do like the fact that Microsoft continues to add features beyond what they already have on launch day. I don't even use BC on Xbox because I have like 7 x360s. However, PS4 not having BC pisses me off because I absolutely hate the PS3. It was underpowered, and I hate top loaders (had a fat one, but BD drive wore out). I'd really like all those exclusives ported to PS4. Sony has been very slow to even do that. ONE God of War game? Come the f*** on. Give us the whole HD collection. Yup. That is why I might consider PS5 if they add back compatibility, although to be honest with a gaming PC, I can access those few PS3 and PS4 exclusives already via PSNow anyway. As for the Xbox One X's back compatibility feature, its major advantage has been the ability to enhance those 360 games to take advantage of the One X's specs. Some 360 games like Witcher 2, can now even be played at 4K. Yeah, I'm annoyed they haven't enhanced PD0 yet. It was kind of a big deal as an exclusive launch title (or near launch?) on 360 and all.",,Viper187666,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

http://www.360fov.net/gaming/yakuza-4-5-removed-psnow/



Sony removed Yakuza from PSNow shortly after adding the two cult-classic games, Yakuza 4 and Yakuza 5. We can only hope they decide to add Yakuza back to the PSNow library, and no more false-advertising from Sony. Many people subscribed to PSNow during the 7 day free trial, expecting to play Yakuza… unfortunately this meant wasting over £100 if they bought a 12 month subscription!

Its the only current gaming platform that is completely unnecessary in every way. I disagree. I find that combining it with my gaming PC gives me the most game coverage. As a PC gamer I can play many PS2 and Nintendo games via emulators and PS3 and PS4 games via the PSNow streaming service. This is not an option that has matured enough or even available when it comes to most Xbox games on the PC.

I had a buddy of mine that I'd play against; I was always Ken, and he'd take Shin Akuma. We still split our matches, despite him spamming air fireballs and being able to pull off that super move that takes half your life if it lands. If you liked The Thousand-Year Door, I can't imagine you not enjoying the first game.  Give it a go when you have a chance! Guess I can roll into PlayStation now, too.  I bet y'all can guess the number one spot! Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  A timeless classic.  The best PlayStation game ever made in my eyes.  I routinely revisit it, and have an absolute blast every single time.  Sure, the difficulty is pretty uneven (mostly easy), but there are just so many little touches that you can tell it was a labor of love from start to finish. Valkyrie Profile might be crazy obtuse for that hidden ending, but dang if it's not one of the best RPGs on the system.  I just love the general feel of the game, and the lore involved.  You feel like all your Einherjar are real people with real stories, and that's awesome.  Uh, my current profile pic is also a drawing I did of Arngrim from some time ago, so...  yeah, I'd say the game resonated with me. Arc the Lad II hit me as a combination of Chrono Trigger and Shining Force.  It might be my favorite SRPG of all time.  Absolutely recommended, although you might want to start with the first game; it's rather short, but sets the stage well for the second game.  The scope of AtLII dwarfs that of the first game. To mix things up, I'll take a rather jubilant game:  Ape Escape.  The N64 had the 3D platformer scene pretty much locked down, but darn if Ape Escape didn't make a run for the crown.  I loved figuring out how to capture those monkeys with all the cool gadgets you get.  This game also required the use of the Dual Shock, and made excellent use of it.  Highly, highly recommended. This is where things get tough.  I've got a bunch of games vying for the fifth spot, but much like my choice on NES with Tecmo Super Bowl, I'm going to go with sheer hours invested.  That means Street Fighter Alpha 3 makes it in.  This was one of the best arcade conversions on the PSX, a system that often paled in comparison to the Saturn for these games.  Capcom really went all out on making this particular version run better on the system.  Plus, that World Tour mode was crazy fun. There are tons of other games I could have listed, but the four that got pushed out were: Metal Gear Solid, Alundra, Suikoden II, and Vagrant Story.

LOVED IT. Fast-paced, non-stop action, soooo much content, cool bosses, gone with the stupid and repetitive puzzles, fun monster invasion mode. Perfect control mechanism, finally able to run quick and do sliding attacks and flying kicks, feels fluid. Great soundtrack, loved the menu style at the beginning, the crossover battles. The first few levels of Leo's campaign are insanely fun, i especially enjoyed the diner scene where you first see the fat hulk zombie and it's wall-to-wall zombies climbing through windows. Honestly I'd read bad reviews about the game so didn't expect much, but I was absolutely baffled by how no-one could love it after I was 30 mins in. Ah man, how can anyone diss RE6?? It's like the drive-thru of video games-- got 20 mins during lunch for a quick dose of adrenaline? Just drop into anyone's game! I think it's because it was on PSNow and basically free that I liked it so much. Had I paid $70 then I probably would've been disappointed, yeah. I also think people that hate 6 are the ones that loved the old RE style pre 4-- the slow, creepy foreboding vibe, and I can understand that, you can't rightfully call them by the same title.",,Evil-Kris,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

I have Steam GOTY Edition. It ran Vanilla with compatibility tweaks (ran compatible with XP SP3). Also, installed FOSE with compatibility, upped the .exe to 4 GB and set affinity for game at 2 cores. It ran even better seemed more stable. I also Installed Unofficial Patch. Okay now for MODS.; Fellout-Full, Enhanced Blood, Flora Overhaul, Colt M4 Carbines, GNR Enhanced, AKS74U, MMMFO, Sprint Mod, DC Interiors, Real World Drinks, Hi Res Weapons and the NMC Large Texture Pack. I had more loaded but it would crash shortly after execution (if it would even execute) so I scaled down my MOD selection. To my shock and surprise the game executed and loaded. 30 hours I had spent trying and troubleshooting. I was able to start a New Game. Played for several hours with only one crash. I got to Megaton (crashed again as I exited the vault but loaded save and worked swell thereafter for a while). I was so stoked, I had never seen FO3 like this I played it 10 years ago on console and never dreamed how good it could look now that I have a gaming CPU. I have an Alienware 15, getting a little long in the tooth in 2018 but it was smoking FO3. I did my thing at Megaton and played around with some console commands still chugging along. Then... I leave Megaton heading north and every time I get just beyond Sunnyvale, where you can see the large overpass it goes kaput. Only thing I can think is maybe Fellout or the NMC pack is adding in to much detail and I am running the game on ultra high settings. I played around with it a bit still no luck. I really don't want to lose Fellout mod it looks so amazing. IDK, if any of you friends read this and know something I haven't tried (and yes I have rifled through the forums and threads or as much as I could and still no dice) save me from having to play FO3 on ...gulp...

If Deep Down was developed by Studio Japan then Sony would own the IP, Sony does not have their studios working on IPs not owned by Sony. Also you can give up hopes of Death Stranding PC as It's a Sony owned game now and they don't tend to release their games on PC. You might get it through PSNOW 3-5 years after it releases, though PSNOW isn't the ideal way to play games, especially for someone who cares about graphics and performance.",,Mario786,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

Regardless, most of the PlayStation exclusives are garbage anyway, so it doesn't really matter.

171873654580,3/14/2018,http://phooll123.tumblr.com/post/171873654580,"Xbox E3 Press Conference Dated As Microsoft Makes Changes For “Biggest Showing Ever”
 Microsoft has officially confirmed its plans for E3 2018. Rather than have its usual presence inside the Los Angeles Convention Center, where E3 takes place, Microsoft is moving the bulk of its efforts across the street to the nearby Microsoft Theater in LA Live. The company says this will make for the company’s “biggest E3 showing ever.”
 First up at the Microsoft Theater will be Microsoft’s E3 press conference, which is scheduled to take place on Sunday, June 10, at 1 PM PT. Following that, it will host Xbox FanFest events, hands-on demos for E3 attendees, and more. “Not only does the Microsoft Theater allow us to centralize our Xbox presence at E3, but its size enables us to include even more fans and partners in the Xbox E3 2018 Briefing than ever before,” said corporate VP Mike Nichols in an Xbox Wire post.  The announcement makes it clear that the move was made in collaboration with the ESA, no doubt to avoid spurring discussions about E3’s demise. Microsoft also points out that it won’t be absent entirely from the official E3 show floor, as it will have a booth for its streaming service, Mixer.  “These changes–expanding our presence, multiple venues, taking over the Microsoft Theater–give us the opportunity to bring together a variety of Xbox experiences into one primary location and, most importantly, let fans in on what we’re up to in 2018 and beyond in a fresh new way,” Nichols said.  At this point, we have little idea of what to expect from Microsoft’s E3 showing. Whereas last year we knew that Xbox One X (then Project Scorpio) would be a major highlight, this year’s show remains more of a mystery. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January that there would be some “positive changes” at E3 for Microsoft, which may have been a reference to the just-announced move. One possibility is the announcement ofHalo 6, which has been discussed but not formally revealed. Microsoft is also said to be working on a PlayStation Now-like game-streaming service.

Which is exactly why everyone should just buy elsewhere. If you were to buy a game, open the cello wrap, and turn around to trade it in they’d consider it used so why can’t the customers. ====================::==================== once again i apologize for the poor sentence structure. when i'm typing i'm not paying attention to periods and paragraphs. so i agree i can make them run on... just bare (sp?) with me. the store in question is located in the pen centre in st. kitts. and i'm not going to mention the employee (aka - the store manager) by name since i think head office has already had a talk with them and now i may have an issue if it comes to having to go and pick up the codes. i find it quite funny that with more recent releases such as the call of duty WWII they can print DLC codes at the bottom of the receipt, yet they can't seem to do the same with steep or ghost recon. ghost recon especially since it's the newest of the two and it's still getting dlc and updates. yes, i know some dlc is only available at pre-order and day one release. BUT it can be done... and you would think if they can arrange it or dig up some codes that may still be valid why not just do that and have a satisfied customer rather than fan the flames of an irritated customer to the point they would never shop there again. heck, i could be that one customer that comes in a drops hundreds compared to the one that only buys a pair of cheap socks and a $1 cheap bin spinner. i get a chuckle out of these idiots that once promoted to store manager and given the key to the front and back door they think they actual hold some sort of power. lol, you're a game store salesperson.... who at any time could wind up unemployed if head office felt your location wasn't producing the sales they were expecting. if anyone wants to know what goes on at eb/gamestop i suggest you look up a youtube person by the name of ""fantavision"". he talks about working at gamestop and all sorts of stuff they would pull... including selling back free games they would get at conventions AND selling/claiming codes that were included in new games. one thing he does touch on is this. every new game eb/gamestop sells the developer gets a cut of, so they open the games and some they would claim as used so they would not have to give the developer their cut. it's hard for the developer to prove which is which since they claim they opened the game for ""display purposes"". gamestop then claims the game as open and used BUT to a customer such as myself, they claim it as new opened product to still get the full retail pricing. this was one reason why microsoft decided to include new releases in their version of PSnow... to cut out the middleman. and isn't it funny how of all the places like walmart, best buy, target, etc. that eb games/gamestop is the one complaining the loudest about potential loss of sales. at least walmart, target and best buy have other stuff in their stores to keep them afloat while eb/gamestop doesn't really. sure they have branched out to become hot topic lite, but places like hot topic have the better deals and clearance racks compared to the latter. so i'm thinking if sony follows suit to compete with microsoft that would leave eb/gamestop really struggling since they would depend on older games at that point... ones that aren't on the PSnow and xbox comparable. and even then, other game shops would sell the older games at a better price. my relative was actually able to get their steep dlc. they bought it through xbox live and actually got it included in another dlc free. so they are happy. and i get the free updates from ghost recon so i'm not upset.",,peytonpeanut2017,Canada,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,eb games employees using codes from new games.. - Page 3,,,

To be honest, RDR is the only reason I keep my PS3 anymore and it’s worth every bit of room it takes up just to have that ability to play. So far it seems that Canada is the only area that doesn’t have issues. I have a friend in Vancouver Island who plays it on PSNow and she says she never has issues, but here it’s just so unreliable. Half the time you can’t see what you’re doing because the quality drops to 120p. The game is worth the cost of an old console, hands-down. I’ve seen RDR at GameStop for $5, so it shouldn’t be more than whatever the Irish equivalent of $100 is, total. (Donno if you’re pounds or euros or if that split is still even a thing. I don’t really pay attention... whoops.) I’m seeing used PS3s going for ~$80 on eBay right now, to give an idea of a price.

BUT it can be done... and you would think if they can arrange it or dig up some codes that may still be valid why not just do that and have a satisfied customer rather than fan the flames of an irritated customer to the point they would never shop there again. heck, i could be that one customer that comes in a drops hundreds compared to the one that only buys a pair of cheap socks and a $1 cheap bin spinner. i get a chuckle out of these idiots that once promoted to store manager and given the key to the front and back door they think they actual hold some sort of power. lol, you're a game store salesperson.... who at any time could wind up unemployed if head office felt your location wasn't producing the sales they were expecting. if anyone wants to know what goes on at eb/gamestop i suggest you look up a youtube person by the name of ""fantavision"". he talks about working at gamestop and all sorts of stuff they would pull... including selling back free games they would get at conventions AND selling/claiming codes that were included in new games. one thing he does touch on is this. every new game eb/gamestop sells the developer gets a cut of, so they open the games and some they would claim as used so they would not have to give the developer their cut. it's hard for the developer to prove which is which since they claim they opened the game for ""display purposes"". gamestop then claims the game as open and used BUT to a customer such as myself, they claim it as new opened product to still get the full retail pricing. this was one reason why microsoft decided to include new releases in their version of PSnow... to cut out the middleman. and isn't it funny how of all the places like walmart, best buy, target, etc. that eb games/gamestop is the one complaining the loudest about potential loss of sales. at least walmart, target and best buy have other stuff in their stores to keep them afloat while eb/gamestop doesn't really. sure they have branched out to become hot topic lite, but places like hot topic have the better deals and clearance racks compared to the latter. so i'm thinking if sony follows suit to compete with microsoft that would leave eb/gamestop really struggling since they would depend on older games at that point... ones that aren't on the PSnow and xbox comparable. and even then, other game shops would sell the older games at a better price. my relative was actually able to get their steep dlc. they bought it through xbox live and actually got it included in another dlc free. so they are happy. and i get the free updates from ghost recon so i'm not upset.",,peytonpeanut2017,Canada,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

How do you define BC? PSNOW is not BC as the game is just being streamed to your PS4 / PC but ultimately the software is still running on PS3 hardware. Is what MS is doing with Xbox One not BC in your eyes?,,ocbdare,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

They never appealed to me before and only got into 4 when my old housemate bought it and I quickly fell in love. Heard amazing things about New Vegas, and with PSNow having finally appeared in my country I started playing it. But I’m finding the game difficult to get used to. Maybe its because its a downgrade from 4, but Im having a hard time doing anything. Find it hard to aim and shoot, I run out of bullets so fast, and my health goes down really quickly. I set it on Very Easy just until I get the hang of it. I just got to Primm and I keep dying over and over again in that casino. My attacks do very little damage while the enemies, even weak ones, seem to do a lot to me. I know I will get better the more I play, but I just thought maybe you guys could offer me advice. I still play 4 and I am quite good at it, but 4 hours into New Vegas and I love it so far, I just cant seem to do anything right in it. Any tips for leveling up fast or getting better gun/ammo, so i can finish this Primm mission and move on? EDIT: Well I feel like an idiot. The game mode was aet on Very Hard, not Very Easy. Im using PSNow to play this, and my internet is good but occasionally PSNow lags slightly. It was lagging when I changed to Very Easy. With the lag, I think I accidentally went one too far all the way back around to Very Hard. All is good now though, flying through it and getting used to things :)",,christopher1393,United States of America,,,Negative,Sadness,Reddit,,,,,Starting out New Vegas after Fallout 4 and finding it difficult.

So, I see Fallout New Vegas - I'm extremely excited , I haven't played it in a long time, since I sold my PS3 a few years back to afford a PS4. So I click in to it, beautiful, it's actually working , the menu looks sharp and the intro rolls smoothly. Now I get in to gameplay, it looks worse than the PS3 version and the sound is compressed but not terrible. First thing I notice is the dreadful input lag, you know that sequence at the beginning when you shoot at bottles? I legitimately had trouble doing it, I missed a couple of times. The combat with the powder gangers was tough too because it was quite laggy, to be honest it just didn't feel right if that makes sense, everything was off in a small way. My speed varies from 10mbps to 50 mbps throughout the day, it never goes below 10 and the average low is honestly probably around 12-13. Got the go ahead, apparently the mininum you require to have a good experience is 5 mbps, gee I should be having a terrific experience if I have double that - wrong. In all honesty, I am willing to tolerate it as it's my favourite game whilst I have other games available , despite them having better graphics and zero input lag - because of nostalgia and because the writing is simply wonderful.

Gaikai tried it, was bought by Sony and merged into the lower stakes delivery of older games on a new platform through PSNow. Now, both Google and Microsoft have announced their intent to launch a streaming service. Both have extensive datacenters around the globe to minimize lag problems. Both have armies of engineers to optimize and solve problems. Microsoft already has a foot in the door with developers and publishers. Google already has its chromecast in many houses. https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16986380/google-chromecast-game-streaming-android-mobile-tv-home-console https://www.slashgear.com/microsoft-cloud-gaming-division-sets-the-stage-for-post-xbox-streaming-15523346/ Now, lets be clear. You and me won't be their target demographic for years to come, but look where Steam was in 2003. In a decade and a half, Steam will need to be St(r)eam, or it's a relic. Pro's of streaming games as a consumer: - No upfront expensive hardware costs. - Games will run on a virtual machine in a datacenter, which are much easier to keep up and running as tech moves on. Want to play a 20 year old game in 2038, no problem. - Cheating will be impossible with all code run on the server. - Modding can still be made possible Cons as a consumer: - no gaming if your internet is down - Modding, even when possible, is likely not going to extend to radical stuff like an external scripting engine like SKSE/NVSE, or shaders. - Monthly subscription fees for yet another online service Pro's in general: - Hardware in datacenters can be utilized 24/7, no longer the massive waste of millions of dollars idling during the day in homes, and in offices at nights. Dramatically dropping costs of processing power for consumers and businesses alike Thoughts? Ideas? More pros or cons? You hate where it's going? For me, it feels like the 80's and the 90's were the era where we had to handcrank our cars to start them. The past two decades we had automatic starters but were still working on them every weekend to clean and fix them, and now we're heading into the era where it ""just works"".",,Washell,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Streaming games - Phase 2,,,

So, yeah. Cool, well all the emulator kiddies can feel free to get 10 summer jobs in a row and save enough for a PC good enough to emulate Bloodborn in any meaningful way. But, no there will never be a PC release of Des or Bloodborne. This is really simple and is parts exclusive rights. Same reason you will never see Super mario 64 with a native PC release. >BBuuububbuuut you can emulate that too. Ad hominem and straw man arguments, nices. Technology evolves. You can't stop that. A high end pc is middle class after the next gen hardware is released. My i5 cpu from 2012 is perfectly fine emulating ps2 games. A current gen 6 core i7 is already fine performing using the current ps3 emulator build, and that emu isn't even close to finished and optimized. In 5 years, Sony will have given up on most ps3 games, only some extreme high demanded games ""might"" get a remastered or remade version for PS5 or whatever it will be called then, and all other games will be forgotten if it wasn't for emulation and a very enthusiastic collectors community. Maybe psnow will be successful and all games will be streamable in console quality, that would be nice, because it sure is a more comfortable way to play these games, emulation was always something you have to get used to. Anyway, ps4 games might join psnow in the future, just as ps3 games are right now, and you can play these on pc, period. Nintendo games will join the pc in emulated form. I would like to point out the topic again: The game ""never"" being playable on pc. I said that's wrong and I statet why.

I have Steam GOTY Edition. It ran Vanilla with compatibility tweaks (ran compatible with XP SP3). Also, installed FOSE with compatibility, upped the .exe to 4 GB and set affinity for game at 2 cores. It ran even better seemed more stable. I also Installed Unofficial Patch. Okay now for MODS.; Fellout-Full, Enhanced Blood, Flora Overhaul, Colt M4 Carbines, GNR Enhanced, AKS74U, MMMFO, Sprint Mod, DC Interiors, Real World Drinks, Hi Res Weapons and the NMC Large Texture Pack. I had more loaded but it would crash shortly after execution (if it would even execute) so I scaled down my MOD selection. To my shock and surprise the game executed and loaded. 30 hours I had spent trying and troubleshooting. I was able to start a New Game. Played for several hours with only one crash. I got to Megaton (crashed again as I exited the vault but loaded save and worked swell thereafter for a while). I was so stoked, I had never seen FO3 like this I played it 10 years ago on console and never dreamed how good it could look now that I have a gaming CPU. I have an Alienware 15, getting a little long in the tooth in 2018 but it was smoking FO3. I did my thing at Megaton and played around with some console commands still chugging along. Then... I leave Megaton heading north and every time I get just beyond Sunnyvale, where you can see the large overpass it goes kaput. Only thing I can think is maybe Fellout or the NMC pack is adding in to much detail and I am running the game on ultra high settings. I played around with it a bit still no luck. I really don't want to lose Fellout mod it looks so amazing. IDK, if any of you friends read this and know something I haven't tried (and yes I have rifled through the forums and threads or as much as I could and still no dice) save me from having to play FO3 on ...gulp... PSNow . Oh the graphics are shhait and interface even worse. If you have read this far thanks much obliged. Sincerely, Hopeless Gamer in The OC (RehabJip) ====================::==================== I did make some progress by uninstalling NMCs Texture Pack. I don't know if ti was conflicting with Fellout or if I just had or have to many mods loaded. I got got out of Sunnyvale and game was playing great, no lag, AI was functioning and then just randomly crashed for no apparent reason. Any advice to make game more stable would be helpful. Primary issues are about a third of the time game will fail on launch or shortly after launch and will need to be relaunched. When game launches stable it crashes intermittently now (after removing NMC) with no real reason I can figure or any warning signs. Below are the details for my machine and software. Shes getting a bit antiquated (even back in 2015 when FO4 launched could not run on anything but low low settings on this thing) but should be more than enough for FO3.

Veterans of the Yakuza series, please feel free to add your comments as well :) Here's what I did. Yakuza 0 was my introduction to the series. Yakuza Kiwami was next. Since the stories in this series are fairly standalone (with some exceptions ofc) I decided to skip Yakuza 2, because I want to play Kiwami 2. Saw the cutscenes from Yakuza 3-5 because I don't have a PS3 and PSNow isn't available in my country. Will play Y6 next, followed by YK2.

Marvel contacted Sega and let them freely use Spider-Man in his boss segment (it's an enemy disguised as Spider-Man), who then later morphs into Batman. They had to remove Batman and added in a Bat-like enemy instead. Godzilla got replaced with a generic T-Rex statue.

171865241388,3/14/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/171865241388,"Microsoft has officially confirmed its plans for E3 2018. Rather than have its usual presence inside the Los Angeles Convention Center, where E3 takes place, Microsoft is moving the bulk of its efforts across the street to the nearby Microsoft Theater in LA Live. The company says this will make for the company’s “biggest E3 showing ever.”

First up at the Microsoft Theater will be Microsoft’s E3 press conference, which is scheduled to take place on Sunday, June 10, at 1 PM PT. Following that, it will host Xbox FanFest events, hands-on demos for E3 attendees, and more. “Not only does the Microsoft Theater allow us to centralize our Xbox presence at E3, but its size enables us to include even more fans and partners in the Xbox E3 2018 Briefing than ever before,” said corporate VP Mike Nichols in an Xbox Wire post.

The announcement makes it clear that the move was made in collaboration with the ESA, no doubt to avoid spurring discussions about E3’s demise. Microsoft also points out that it won’t be absent entirely from the official E3 show floor, as it will have a booth for its streaming service, Mixer.

“These changes–expanding our presence, multiple venues, taking over the Microsoft Theater–give us the opportunity to bring together a variety of Xbox experiences into one primary location and, most importantly, let fans in on what we’re up to in 2018 and beyond in a fresh new way,” Nichols said.

At this point, we have little idea of what to expect from Microsoft’s E3 showing. Whereas last year we knew that Xbox One X (then Project Scorpio) would be a major highlight, this year’s show remains more of a mystery. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January that there would be some “positive changes” at E3 for Microsoft, which may have been a reference to the just-announced move. One possibility is the announcement of Halo 6, which has been discussed but not formally revealed. Microsoft is also said to be working on a PlayStation Now-like game-streaming service.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"Microsoft Reveals E3 Plans For Xbox's ""Biggest Showing Ever""",Post,,

171928573758,3/16/2018,http://fpnews-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/171928573758,"Microsoft has set up a new cloud gaming division in the company to look forward to a future where its gaming strategy does not revolve around Xbox.

A window reflecting a nearby building at the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US. Reuters.

If you are living under a rock or suddenly happen to read this article out of the blue then the Xbox is Microsoft’s gaming console that is geared both towards gaming as well as living-room entertainment.

Currently, the innovation efforts from both the console makers or companies that focus on gaming PCs and the game developers are focused to make better-looking games, to make dedicated gaming devices (PCs and Consoles) more powerful while pushing for portability when it comes to hand-held devices (Nintendo Switch). Microsoft has been planning to move in a direction where the device does not matter and the gaming experience stays similar regardless of how powerful or portable the device is.

Nintendo Switch

According to a report by The Verge, as part of the planning, the company has been acquiring smaller companies that have been working on improving the gaming experience. Some of the acquisitions include Havok, Simplygon and more recently, PlayFab earlier this year. The report points out that these companies are essential to Microsoft’s plans to launch its cloud gaming services.

The newly created cloud gaming division by Microsoft will be headed by 20-year Microsoft veteran Kareem Choudhry. Talking to The Verge, Kareem added, “Phil really wanted a dedicated team focused exclusively on the gaming cloud. Those were conversations that started happening last summer, and we really started creating the structure of the organization at the end of last year.” The company wants to push game developers to use the cloud as more and more games start providing an experience that spans multiple devices.

Microsoft is looking to create something that is like Netflix but for gaming where a subscription will give users access to whatever game they like, on whatever device they want to play the game on. However, Microsoft won’t be the only company with the ambition to offer a game streaming service. Sony tried its hand with PlayStation Now and Nvidia is also offering its gaming streaming service in the form of GeForce Now. This service is a difficult nut to crack while maintaining the quality and ease of use. However, Microsoft seems to be determined to offer this service in three years. Till then, it has a long way to go from getting the technology right to attracting gamers and game developers to the service.

It's probably easier to develop and sell a remaster than a brand new IP. It can also be a good way to gauge interest in a dormant IP. For example, with the recent re-release of the Devil May Cry HD Collection on current-gen systems and PC there is a possibility Capcom could be testing the waters to see if there is interest in a another entry in the mainline series and not another spin-off/reboot like DmC. Microsoft is going to continue with their backwards compatibility strategy with titles from.multiple generations, and Sony would be stupid not to follow along as well. It will be possible because of the hardware they are using and it will give them a much larger game library at launch. Sony was likely betting on their PSNow service taking off as it would have cost them less money than attempting hardware native BC or software emulation. No one was expecting or predicting that MS would go the route they did with BC. Hell even MS wasn’t planning on doing that until Mattrick was out and Spencer took over the Xbox division.",,xXKILLA_D21Xx,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

As The Verge reports, it's something Microsoft been building up for a while with the acquisition of small companies like PlayFab, which is focused on game development in the cloud. The company also has the basic structure of what a cloud streaming offering could look like with Xbox Game Pass, its subscription service that gives players access to large library of games for $10 a month. While early attempts at game streaming have crashed and burned, like OnLive, it's still an intriguing market. Sony's PlayStation Now service is still alive and kicking on the PS4 and PC, and NVIDIA is doubling down on game streaming with GeForce Now. The latter is still just a beta test though -- even the graphics card giant hasn't figured out how to charge for high-end game streaming. Microsoft isn't saying much about what the new gaming cloud division is working on yet, but its leader, Kareem Choudhry, hints that they're exploring ways to bring content to gamers on any device.",,StyM,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Microsoft forms a new gaming cloud division,,,

171898153514,3/15/2018,http://mrcifci.tumblr.com/post/171898153514,"With little fanfare, Microsoft has announced that it’s launching a new gaming cloud division, a move that would set the company up to enter the world of game streaming. As The Verge reports, it’s something Microsoft been building up for a while with the acquisition of small companies like PlayFab, which is focused on game development in the cloud. The company also has the basic structure of what a cloud streaming offering could look like with Xbox Game Pass, its subscription service that gives players access to large library of games for $10 a month.

While early attempts at game streaming have crashed and burned, like OnLive, it’s still an intriguing market. Sony’s PlayStation Now service is still alive and kicking on the PS4 and PC, and NVIDIA is doubling down on game streaming with GeForce Now. The latter is still just a beta test though – even the graphics card giant hasn’t figured out how to charge for high-end game streaming. Microsoft isn’t saying much about what the new gaming cloud division is working on yet, but its leader, Kareem Choudhry, hints that they’re exploring ways to bring content to gamers on any device.

The company was so unpopular back in 2015 that the president of an electronic parts company wanted to be dissociated from the Kyoto-based game maker. ""Please don't call us a Nintendo-related stock anymore,"" the president said at a news conference for an earnings release. Inventories of Nintendo's disappointing Wii U device were building up at the time, leading to cuts in output plans that hurt electronic parts suppliers. But three years later, critics see Nintendo in a completely different light. The Switch, a hybrid game system that serves as both a home console or a handheld, has been flying off the shelves. Its U.S. sales have outpaced those of a popular predecessor, the Wii, encouraging Nintendo to upgrade the sales target twice for the year ending this month. Investors have shown their zeal for Nintendo, whose share price has more than doubled since the release of the Switch about a year ago. The stock's trading volume by value for the nearly concluded fiscal 2017 totaled roughly 25 trillion yen ($236 billion) as of Monday, more than twice the figure for second-place SoftBank Group. This revival compares with the murky outlook for suppliers of electronics company Apple. The U.S. company's top-tier iPhone X has driven consumers away with its lofty price tag. Apple now looks to curb prices by ""putting cost-cutting pressure on parts suppliers,"" said Masamitsu Oki at Fivestar Asset Management. Nintendo buys fewer parts from outside suppliers than Apple, yet is influential enough to lift profits at some electronic parts developers. Shares have skyrocketed 62% for Minebea Mitsumi since the debut of the Switch, as the company is thought to build the device. Hosiden, which also assembles the Switch, and supplier MegaChips have surged more than 30% each. ""The rally of parts suppliers will be followed by that of software publishers,"" predicts an official at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Nintendo has been creating game content mostly on its own, but third-party publishers are set to benefit from the Switch's booming sales. One of the most promising developers is Capcom, whose shares hit a 17-year high Monday on strong earnings and growing hopes tied to planned titles for the Switch. One big question involves whether the fervor for the Switch will be sustainable. Global sales will reach at least 200 million units, about twice as many as for the Wii, according to one estimate. Nintendo sees its operating profit more than quintupling to 160 billion yen this fiscal year. Nintendo seeks to sell consoles even at a loss, with the company more than erasing the red ink through high-margin software. This business model means that profits usually would begin three to four years after releasing a new gaming system. ""It is highly possible that the company earns a record profit in fiscal 2019,"" predicts Hideki Yasuda at Ace Research Institute. Video game sales generally are shielded from the economic cycle. As data at home and abroad hints at an economic slowdown, investors are shying away from blue chips such as banks and electrical machinery manufacturers -- making it even more likely that Nintendo and its suppliers will remain a driving force of the Tokyo market in the near term ====================::==================== SaltSlasher said: ↑ If we're talking 200 million, Switch is gonna have to average 50 million among NA, EU, JP and WW, EACH, and the only machines to get a 50 in 1 of the 4 categories was PS2 in NA and EU, and DS in NA and EU, and they were both in the market for over 10 years each. Yet, JP's max has been 33, and WW is 25. So even if we took the best of each 4 regions from any machines, NA 57 + EU 55 + JP 33 + WW 26 that is roughly 170 million. Predicting Switch sells 200 million is insanely high, and yeah I know an iPhone can sell a couple hundred million in a year, but damn, Switch just ain't gonna put 1 in each hand at $300. Click to expand... I agree. I am sure however there will be drastic price drops in the future, time will tell, but for sure in 2019. It could be that Nintendo releases a new SKU this year, which I didnt think of till the update came. Even then though, without a price drop for Christmas, it will be 25 million this fiscal year even with smash and pokemon. But forget phone comparisons, it is an apples to oranges comparison, one is almost a necessity and the other is a toy. I personally always felt Switch would easily break 20 million in Japan, and maybe could be best selling device in JP history, selling like 40 million. And I wouldn't be shocked if they sold 40 million in NA, plenty of machines have done that, but I just don't see EU and WW numbers getting that high, and NA and JP would have to compensate, and even if EU and WW do break records, NA and JP would still have to compensate on top to get to 200. Nintendo easily has 70 million fans willing to buy product, biggest thing they can do is get 1 person to buy a 2nd one with a refresh but I just don't see the same collectors edition thing happening on Switch like with 3DS where people own like 5 of them to have different styles, not when Joy Cons are for that, I see 200 million Joy Cons being sold. But I just don't see the whole 1 switch per kid/person unless they do a major refresh and kid brother gets the old Switch, not that buying 1 for each kid at Christmas. 1 time in my childhood anything remotely happen, when I got a GBC and my sister got a Tiger Game.com...and even her household has like 4-5 3DS's, they never went out and bought 2 at a time. Click to expand... I dont see how you cant see households with multiple Switches with different styles, it is already here. Some people already have a grey and another colored joycon Switch to differentiate them. I think I'd predict +100 million, IF: Click to expand... -No one else releases a handheld. Nvidia Shield Tablet 2 would be really interesting. Xbox's cloud and service gaming is interesting. And PlayStation's Now service can get interesting, as would a new handheld. Click to expand... The only competition I could see to Nintendo's handheld space is Apple entering the ring with a more focused all in one handheld phone gaming system. -Started selling just the Switch with no dock for $200 and packed in Splatoon 2/Odyssey/or other newer games. Click to expand... I can see that sooner than you think. -They can keep up with demand all the time, not the constant inventory issues Click to expand... Nintendo has new partners for hardware manufacturing instead of only having just one now. They wont have issues in the future unless they start selling over 30 million a year. I forsee comparison videos about the different Switch models with different parts. -Switch has a full mid-gen upgrade refresh Click to expand... It seems that is coming this year or the next. -Switch is in market for more than 6 years, I want to say 8-10 Click to expand... Highly likely. If the 3DS is anything to go by, Nintendo will support it for a few more years after they come up with a new system. -The market for Steam indies in handheld is a bigger market than I've always thought and people buy Switch just for indies Click to expand... There are people who are already doing this, but at best they will make up like 5% of the switch population, ie buy switch mainly for indies. -Nindies starts publishing games for indie devs lto get more exclusivity with Steam with no PS4/Xbox Click to expand... Eh? Why would they need to do that? The switch is already a preferred system for indies over the PS4 and Xbox. -Nintendo goes crazy developing a crap ton of games for every gamer, like no stone unturned, hype every year for 6+ years. Click to expand... Define crap ton? I see Nintendo more than doubling their output since they seem to be almost doubling it now with all the outsourcing they are doing now.",,Thesuffering,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,It’s now estimated the Switch will sell 200 million globally,,,

There are other corrupt data games out there gamers should be careful of. It’s a shame because my PS4 Pro was my 22nd birthday present. I could’ve bought a new hard drive, but I decided to get a slim because: A.) My uncle wanted to upgrade to the Pro from his launch PS4. B.) I wasn’t even using the 4K resolution anyway as my tv is incompatible. & C.) I wanted something newer with a longer warranty. Wasn’t willing to keep my Pro risking it may malfunction down the line. It was a great system. I had so much fun with it. I played Resident Evil, Dying Light, Fallout 4, MGSV, & most of all, Friday the 13th where I made most of my awesome PSN friends. Least I know my first PS4 is in great hands. 🎮

I might get the upcoming PS5 if it has back compatibility. For this gen though, I think the Xbox One X is a much better console alternative. The PS4's lack of back compatibility is a major drawback. BTW, I am just responding to the PS4 fanboys here who do nothing but attack me for choosing the Xbox One X. Otherwise I am okay with whatever console you prefer and don't even bring it up. Maybe you should accuse them of shilling for Sony. Sure I do point why I feel the Xbox One X is the better console for this gen but at least I try to be logical and civil in my response unlike many on the other side. I do like the fact that Microsoft continues to add features beyond what they already have on launch day. I don't even use BC on Xbox because I have like 7 x360s. However, PS4 not having BC pisses me off because I absolutely hate the PS3. It was underpowered, and I hate top loaders (had a fat one, but BD drive wore out). I'd really like all those exclusives ported to PS4. Sony has been very slow to even do that. ONE God of War game? Come the f*** on. Give us the whole HD collection. Yup. That is why I might consider PS5 if they add back compatibility, although to be honest with a gaming PC, I can access those few PS3 and PS4 exclusives already via PSNow anyway. As for the Xbox One X's back compatibility feature, its major advantage has been the ability to enhance those 360 games to match the One X's specs. Some 360 games like Witcher 2, can now even be played at 4K.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

171898063911,3/15/2018,http://engadget-yahoopartner.tumblr.com/post/171898063911,"With little fanfare, Microsoft has announced that it’s launching a new gaming cloud division, a move that would set the company up to enter the world of game streaming. As The Verge reports, it’s something Microsoft been building up for a while with the acquisition of small companies like PlayFab, which is focused on game development in the cloud. The company also has the basic structure of what a cloud streaming offering could look like with Xbox Game Pass, its subscription service that gives players access to large library of games for $10 a month.

While early attempts at game streaming have crashed and burned, like OnLive, it’s still an intriguing market. Sony’s PlayStation Now service is still alive and kicking on the PS4 and PC, and NVIDIA is doubling down on game streaming with GeForce Now. The latter is still just a beta test though – even the graphics card giant hasn’t figured out how to charge for high-end game streaming. Microsoft isn’t saying much about what the new gaming cloud division is working on yet, but its leader, Kareem Choudhry, hints that they’re exploring ways to bring content to gamers on any device.

We know its possible but do you think Sega would do it? I doubt we'll see remakes and remasters of Y4 and Y5. They're both massive games and they are already available on PSNow via the PS4. Y5 could probably get a more native PS4 release simply by upscaling the resolution and scrapping the interlacing it seems to use. But, I wouldn't rule out a Y3 remaster though. The game looks incredibly dated, even by PS3 standards, and its western release was heavily censored and cut back vs the Japanese release. They've successfully built a lot of momentum in the west with the releases of Zero and Kiwami, and the relatively quick follow up of Y6, and the recent announcement of localization of K2. Moving forward with a Kiwami remake for Y3 would keep that momentum moving and it'd be a smaller undertaking them trying to remake the much larger Y4 and Y5 games.",,StargateGuy,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Microsoft creates a new gaming cloud division to look at a future beyond Xbox- Technology News, Firstpost





Microsoft has set up a new cloud gaming division in the company to look forward to a future where its gaming strategy does not revolve around Xbox.

If you are living under a rock or suddenly happen to read this article out of the blue then the Xbox is Microsoft’s gaming console that is geared both towards gaming as well as living-room entertainment.

Currently, the innovation efforts from both the console makers or companies that focus on gaming PCs and the game developers are focused to make better-looking games, to make dedicated gaming devices (PCs and Consoles) more powerful while pushing for portability when it comes to hand-held devices (Nintendo Switch). Microsoft has been planning to move in a direction where the device does not matter and the gaming experience stays similar regardless of how powerful or portable the device is.

According to a report by The Verge, as part of the planning, the company has been acquiring smaller companies that have been working on improving the gaming experience. Some of the acquisitions include Havok, Simplygon and more recently, PlayFab earlier this year. The report points out that these companies are essential to Microsoft’s plans to launch its cloud gaming services.

The newly created cloud gaming division by Microsoft will be headed by 20-year Microsoft veteran Kareem Choudhry. Talking to The Verge, Kareem added, “Phil really wanted a dedicated team focused exclusively on the gaming cloud. Those were conversations that started happening last summer, and we really started creating the structure of the organization at the end of last year.” The company wants to push game developers to use the cloud as more and more games start providing an experience that spans multiple devices.

Microsoft is looking to create something that is like Netflix but for gaming where a subscription will give users access to whatever game they like, on whatever device they want to play the game on. However, Microsoft won’t be the only company with the ambition to offer a game streaming service. Sony tried its hand with PlayStation Now and Nvidia is also offering its gaming streaming service in the form of GeForce Now. This service is a difficult nut to crack while maintaining the quality and ease of use. However, Microsoft seems to be determined to offer this service in three years. Till then, it has a long way to go from getting the technology right to attracting gamers and game developers to the service.

The company was so unpopular back in 2015 that the president of an electronic parts company wanted to be dissociated from the Kyoto-based game maker. ""Please don't call us a Nintendo-related stock anymore,"" the president said at a news conference for an earnings release. Inventories of Nintendo's disappointing Wii U device were building up at the time, leading to cuts in output plans that hurt electronic parts suppliers. But three years later, critics see Nintendo in a completely different light. The Switch, a hybrid game system that serves as both a home console or a handheld, has been flying off the shelves. Its U.S. sales have outpaced those of a popular predecessor, the Wii, encouraging Nintendo to upgrade the sales target twice for the year ending this month. Investors have shown their zeal for Nintendo, whose share price has more than doubled since the release of the Switch about a year ago. The stock's trading volume by value for the nearly concluded fiscal 2017 totaled roughly 25 trillion yen ($236 billion) as of Monday, more than twice the figure for second-place SoftBank Group. This revival compares with the murky outlook for suppliers of electronics company Apple. The U.S. company's top-tier iPhone X has driven consumers away with its lofty price tag. Apple now looks to curb prices by ""putting cost-cutting pressure on parts suppliers,"" said Masamitsu Oki at Fivestar Asset Management. Nintendo buys fewer parts from outside suppliers than Apple, yet is influential enough to lift profits at some electronic parts developers. Shares have skyrocketed 62% for Minebea Mitsumi since the debut of the Switch, as the company is thought to build the device. Hosiden, which also assembles the Switch, and supplier MegaChips have surged more than 30% each. ""The rally of parts suppliers will be followed by that of software publishers,"" predicts an official at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Nintendo has been creating game content mostly on its own, but third-party publishers are set to benefit from the Switch's booming sales. One of the most promising developers is Capcom, whose shares hit a 17-year high Monday on strong earnings and growing hopes tied to planned titles for the Switch. One big question involves whether the fervor for the Switch will be sustainable. Global sales will reach at least 200 million units, about twice as many as for the Wii, according to one estimate. Nintendo sees its operating profit more than quintupling to 160 billion yen this fiscal year. Nintendo seeks to sell consoles even at a loss, with the company more than erasing the red ink through high-margin software. This business model means that profits usually would begin three to four years after releasing a new gaming system. ""It is highly possible that the company earns a record profit in fiscal 2019,"" predicts Hideki Yasuda at Ace Research Institute. Video game sales generally are shielded from the economic cycle. As data at home and abroad hints at an economic slowdown, investors are shying away from blue chips such as banks and electrical machinery manufacturers -- making it even more likely that Nintendo and its suppliers will remain a driving force of the Tokyo market in the near term ====================::==================== SaltSlasher said: ↑ If we're talking 200 million, Switch is gonna have to average 50 million among NA, EU, JP and WW, EACH, and the only machines to get a 50 in 1 of the 4 categories was PS2 in NA and EU, and DS in NA and EU, and they were both in the market for over 10 years each. Yet, JP's max has been 33, and WW is 25. So even if we took the best of each 4 regions from any machines, NA 57 + EU 55 + JP 33 + WW 26 that is roughly 170 million. Predicting Switch sells 200 million is insanely high, and yeah I know an iPhone can sell a couple hundred million in a year, but damn, Switch just ain't gonna put 1 in each hand at $300. Click to expand... I agree. I am sure however there will be drastic price drops in the future, time will tell, but for sure in 2019. It could be that Nintendo releases a new SKU this year, which I didnt think of till the update came. Even then though, without a price drop for Christmas, it will be 25 million this fiscal year even with smash and pokemon. But forget phone comparisons, it is an apples to oranges comparison, one is almost a necessity and the other is a toy. I personally always felt Switch would easily break 20 million in Japan, and maybe could be best selling device in JP history, selling like 40 million. And I wouldn't be shocked if they sold 40 million in NA, plenty of machines have done that, but I just don't see EU and WW numbers getting that high, and NA and JP would have to compensate, and even if EU and WW do break records, NA and JP would still have to compensate on top to get to 200. Nintendo easily has 70 million fans willing to buy product, biggest thing they can do is get 1 person to buy a 2nd one with a refresh but I just don't see the same collectors edition thing happening on Switch like with 3DS where people own like 5 of them to have different styles, not when Joy Cons are for that, I see 200 million Joy Cons being sold. But I just don't see the whole 1 switch per kid/person unless they do a major refresh and kid brother gets the old Switch, not that buying 1 for each kid at Christmas. 1 time in my childhood anything remotely happen, when I got a GBC and my sister got a Tiger Game.com...and even her household has like 4-5 3DS's, they never went out and bought 2 at a time. Click to expand... I dont see how you cant see households with multiple Switches with different styles, it is already here. Some people already have a grey and another colored joycon Switch to differentiate them. I think I'd predict +100 million, IF: Click to expand... -No one else releases a handheld. Nvidia Shield Tablet 2 would be really interesting. Xbox's cloud and service gaming is interesting. And PlayStation's Now service can get interesting, as would a new handheld. Click to expand... The only competition I could see to Nintendo's handheld space is Apple entering the ring with a more focused all in one handheld phone gaming system. -Started selling just the Switch with no dock for $200 and packed in Splatoon 2/Odyssey/or other newer games. Click to expand... I can see that sooner than you think. -They can keep up with demand all the time, not the constant inventory issues Click to expand... Nintendo has new partners for hardware manufacturing instead of only having just one now. They wont have issues in the future unless they start selling over 30 million a year. I forsee comparison videos about the different Switch models with different parts. -Switch has a full mid-gen upgrade refresh Click to expand... It seems that is coming this year or the next. -Switch is in market for more than 6 years, I want to say 8-10 Click to expand... Highly likely. If the 3DS is anything to go by, Nintendo will support it for a few more years after they come up with a new system. -The market for Steam indies in handheld is a bigger market than I've always thought and people buy Switch just for indies Click to expand... There are people who are already doing this, but at best they will make up like 5% of the switch population, ie buy switch mainly for indies. -Nindies starts publishing games for indie devs lto get more exclusivity with Steam with no PS4/Xbox Click to expand... Eh? Why would they need to do that? The switch is already a preferred system for indies over the PS4 and Xbox. -Nintendo goes crazy developing a crap ton of games for every gamer, like no stone unturned, hype every year for 6+ years. Click to expand... Define crap ton? I see Nintendo more than doubling their output since they seem to be almost doubling it now with all the outsourcing they are doing now.",,Thesuffering,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,It’s now estimated the Switch will sell 200 million globally,,,
