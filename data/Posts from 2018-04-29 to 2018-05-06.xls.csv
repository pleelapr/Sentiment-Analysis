Currently I'm busy with my God of War marathon but It's going way faster as expected so I'm already on the look for some new games Currently I've got my eyes on Sly Cooper and marathon all those games. But any other titles that I should really look out for? No racing/fighting or Jrpg suggestions for the rest I'm very open minded ====================::==================== @Avatar_Of_Battle I'm almost 100% on those infamous games I'll definitely have a look on those when it comes to Metro, I've played both on PC so they are in the back of my mind.

I was wondering if anyone got the platinum for this game through Playstation now and how you experienced the game through this system. For instance does it feel laggy or anything you can come up with (playing on a ps4/ps4pro). I'll probably start my 7 days free trial to get as many god of war games platinums as I can and if it works flawless I'll maybe even get a month extra for some ps3 games. This question goes out to all god of war games. Thanks for any feedback! ====================::==================== 1 hour ago, Deluziion90 said: it's only for full focussing on the god of war series which dont have any DLC'S luckily. But with all the comments before I'll probably give it a go its free for 7 days anyways. As long as I dont sync the games they wont come on my profile as far as I know. If I notice lag or any problems I can always quit In my experience Psnow can and will auto-sync games.

Just because some want BC DOESN'T mean that a majority does. Sony isn't wrong, though they aren't really giving you the truth either. The truth is that the PS4 is incompatible with the PS4. In order for Sony to make BC happen, they would literally have to spend multi-millions on re-coding several PS3 games to be PS4 compatible (an emulator is impossible), and for what gain? Some of you want something that will cost multiple millions of dollars for free. There just isn't any good sense for Sony to do that. And Sony would rather put that money to better use by investing in NEW games specifically for the PS4. So Sony is doing the right thing, you just refuse to accept it. Again, DON'T think that since Microsoft did BC that Sony can too, cause that isn't the case. The XBO uses a very similar architecture to the XB 360, and that is why the XBO can do BC. The PS4 is very different from the PS3, because the PS3 used the cell processor, which is completely incompatible with PS4 hardware. Games have to be completely re-coded, which is why we have so many remasters. Developers and Publisher will do this because they can then still charge for the remaster and are getting paid for their work...whereas they wouldn't be paid for their work if they did BC. Videogames are a business, and NOT a f'n charity. Xbox is using emulation....the same thing u can do on the PC(digital foundry was playing Demon souls at 4k on pc) So yes Sony could do BC with emulation but why would they when they have PSNOW",,ChiefStabaHoe,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I imagine it's exactly like Playstation NOW and uses a lot of bandwidth in the process. I did a bit of looking around, and apparently it's the new name for GRID, which went into beta in 2013, but is now in beta again? And now also supports access to your own steam library. Not sure if it includes access to an additional library of GFN games. Basically, it's a rent-your-own-GRID-server thing, where you install your own games to play off a dedicated VM on some server somewhere. Like renting a PC, but less hassle, and more input latency. I can see this actually being pretty cool for people with fast internet connections, or who have access to high speed connections at, say, work, school, cafes, ect, especially the later. Bringing a macbook to work and playing your steam library during lunch sounds pretty great. No need for a high-end PC at home, or setting up a private server and jumping through all the hoops and troubleshooting of using a VPN with GameStream or Steam in-home streaming. Just connect to your Cloud server like any other streaming service, install your favorite games, and play. More reliable and better upload speeds, though I imagine the performance isn't exactly GTX1080 level. Probably more like 1050Ti. That said, I have no idea if that's how it is, that's just how it sounded in the wikiped article.",,DarkZV2Beta,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

An open platform breeds more competition because there is more to select from therefore developers have to make better games to compete with each other. Can't the argument be made as well that developers are losing out on tons of cash? Imagine the sales if HZD was released on PC or BOTW, hell they would make more money off of people buying those games on PC, because I like lots of other people won't buy a console for a handful of games but I would pick them up in a heartbeat on PC.

I was wondering if anyone got the platinum for this game through Playstation now and how you experienced the game through this system. For instance does it feel laggy or anything you can come up with (playing on a ps4/ps4pro). I'll probably start my 7 days free trial to get as many god of war games platinums as I can and if it works flawless I'll maybe even get a month extra for some ps3 games. This question goes out to all god of war games. Thanks for any feedback! ====================::==================== I tried it with the free trial some weeks ago and it worked pretty well in general. No experience with GOW but I did some racing games and hardly noticed any lag at all. Your internet is much better than mine but I don't think my own speed was to blame for the few framerate drops I did experience. Those happened mostly during peak hours so from about 7 PM CET til about 10 PM. Nothing that would deter me from taking a full subscription though. I say go for it.

Funny how they say that yet obviously think demand is high enough to build an entire service around it and charge for it. Then of course there is their flood of previous gen remaster and re-releases that they put up for sale. Strange moves from a company that supposedly thinks no one wants to play older games huh? Not strange at all. They never said no one wants to play older games. They said BC is always a highly requested, yet not used much feature. It is still used by a very small minority, so why not take the opportunity to open another revenue stream? They're not wasting resources by trying to implement it on a hardware level for it to be used by only a small amount of people, but rather getting a whole new revenue stream from that small crowd. Smart business move, in my opinion. > MS said it when Mattrick was running it because the Xbox didn’t support it at the time. That obviously changed with Phil Spencer. Lol forgot about the almighty savior Phil. No. Microsoft didn't give two shits about BC, because just like Sony said last year, they too said a small percentage (I think the number they put out was 5%) actually use BC when given the option. You can chalk that up as Don talking out of his ass, but you'll only be lying to yourself. The only reason why they implemented it for the X1 was for the good PR, since they were/are getting destroyed in sales. It had nothing to do with Phil and everything to do with damage control.",,superkarmah,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Just because some want BC DOESN'T mean that a majority does. Sony isn't wrong, though they aren't really giving you the truth either. The truth is that the PS4 is incompatible with the PS4. In order for Sony to make BC happen, they would literally have to spend multi-millions on re-coding several PS3 games to be PS4 compatible (an emulator is impossible), and for what gain? Some of you want something that will cost multiple millions of dollars for free. There just isn't any good sense for Sony to do that. And Sony would rather put that money to better use by investing in NEW games specifically for the PS4. So Sony is doing the right thing, you just refuse to accept it. Again, DON'T think that since Microsoft did BC that Sony can too, cause that isn't the case. The XBO uses a very similar architecture to the XB 360, and that is why the XBO can do BC. The PS4 is very different from the PS3, because the PS3 used the cell processor, which is completely incompatible with PS4 hardware. Games have to be completely re-coded, which is why we have so many remasters. Developers and Publisher will do this because they can then still charge for the remaster and are getting paid for their work...whereas they wouldn't be paid for their work if they did BC. Videogames are a business, and NOT a f'n charity. Xbox is using emulation....the same thing u can do on the PC(digital foundry was playing Demon souls at 4k on pc) So yes Sony could do BC with emulation but why would they when they have PSNOW they spent millions on psnow to charge us 20 a month to do what xb1 does for free. #4duhgamerz",,JohnWall32,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

However, I'll note that: 1. I was home from college with a bunch of free time, so I was able to go through a bunch of these games (~10 a month) while still getting the full experience. I didn't feel rushed. 2. I have an ethernet connection. I had issues with the Wi-Fi lagging, but ethernet worked very well for me. 3. $20/month is rather pricey. Since your benefit is essentially how many games you're able to play within a month, you really have to gauge the amount you'll be able to play. The service let me become a fan of the those franchises I listed above, so I definitely felt like my time in PlayStation Now was worth it.

I was wondering if anyone got the platinum for this game through Playstation now and how you experienced the game through this system. For instance does it feel laggy or anything you can come up with (playing on a ps4/ps4pro). I'll probably start my 7 days free trial to get as many god of war games platinums as I can and if it works flawless I'll maybe even get a month extra for some ps3 games. This question goes out to all god of war games. Thanks for any feedback! ====================::==================== I didn't play this game in particular, but I tried the service back in December. Played through 10 games and The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC with it, and it worked great the entire time. Some of them were fighting games, too. Which, if there had been a lot of lag with, would have made moves impossible to pull off. One of them even had online trophies. As long as you have decent internet, I think you'll be fine. I don't think my PS4 was ever showing more than 50+ Mbps.

After suggesting that games from Japanese publishers will be on stage, Microsoft has now teased its showing even more. In a blog post today, Microsoft's Mike Nichols said the company has a ""great briefing filled with new games"" on tap. ""We're hard at work on exciting plans for E3, from what will be a great briefing filled with new games to the fan experience at the Microsoft Theater,"" Nichols said. ""This is our biggest E3 yet, and we look forward to a great week for gamers. Again, thank you to the amazing Xbox community."" Microsoft's E3 2018 briefing takes place on Sunday, June 11, starting at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET. Whereas last year we knew that Xbox One X (then Project Scorpio) would be a major highlight, we know relatively less about this year's show. In January, Spencer said that there would be some ""positive changes"" at E3 for Microsoft, which could have been a reference to the company's decision to hire out the nearby Microsoft Theatre. Microsoft will still have a presence on the E3 show floor, but it will be dedicated to Mixer exclusively, while the rest of the activities take place across the street in the Microsoft Theatre. One possible announcement from Microsoft this year is Halo 6, which has been discussed but not formally revealed. Microsoft is also said to be working on a PlayStation Now-like game-streaming service. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on E3 2018 in the days and weeks ahead. In other E3 news, The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red has confirmed it will attend E3 this year. Intriguingly, the Polish studio might be talking about an unspecified RPG at the show.",,agentspoon,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Truth is that there are two reasons for no BC. 1) Cynically, it would interfere with PSNow streaming service. Who the f*** wants to buy games there when you can just pop in an old disk? It would probably ruin PSNow and Sony knows it. Reselling games is good source of income, I guess. 2) It might have been an expensive feature to add into the PS4 and after the PS3s debacle, so Sony didn't want to take the risk. Instead, it would put out cheaper hardware and focus more on games, which seems to have worked (though it might also be because MS s*** itself). Alternatively, say adding BC makes the PS4 $100 more expensive and the loss of sales wouldn't be offset by the interest in BC. I don't understand why people would argue for less features instead of more. Personally, I hope Sony adds it next gen.",,Parakeeeet,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Can’t back this up on if it’s true or not with all PSNow games or if it’s true even for all PS4 games. This is just the first reason that popped into my head as to why it might be. Regardless, I wish the PS2onPS4 games were expanded, still have some games on there that were a lot of fun playing when I was younger, but I don’t think much of Sony’s focus is on the PS2onPS4, let alone any PS1 games aside from any remasters.

They want to make something back on their Gaikai investment. If they were to allow us to just play PS1 and PS2 games from our digital library, which would be easily possibly since emulation for these two doesn't take that much horsepower. My Raspberry Pi can run PS1 games and they've already shown PS2 games working, but now they want to charge for them with the inclusion of trophies. PS3 emulation has come a LOOONG way in the past two years. If the few people that are working on it had the source code from Sony, I could see it being even better by a long shot. I know everyone points out that the Cell processor makes this more difficult, but I find it hard to believe that Sony, who has the keys to the kingdom to develop this, couldn't get PS3 games working in some capacity.

I was wondering if anyone got the platinum for this game through Playstation now and how you experienced the game through this system. For instance does it feel laggy or anything you can come up with (playing on a ps4/ps4pro). I'll probably start my 7 days free trial to get as many god of war games platinums as I can and if it works flawless I'll maybe even get a month extra for some ps3 games. This question goes out to all god of war games. Thanks for any feedback! ====================::==================== 9 minutes ago, starcrunch061 said: It works pretty well, so long as your internet isn't giving you trouble. My only gripe with PSNow is that it is very quick at cutting you out at the slightest slowdown. IN addition to plats, you can use it to 100% games that you don't want to pay for DLC. I did this for Saint's Row 3, Enslaved and The Force Unleashed. Unfortunately, some games don't come with the DLC, but many do. it's only for full focussing on the god of war series which dont have any DLC'S luckily. But with all the comments before I'll probably give it a go its free for 7 days anyways. As long as I dont sync the games they wont come on my profile as far as I know.

Seems backwards to love a game you'd never have bought, even though you did spend money to play it. The whole statement makes no sense TC. For me, it would be Lost Planet 2.

Rather than feel like it enhances certain games, I feel like it's outright necessary for them. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is one of the only games I play regularly and even though it runs like absolute crap compared to retail games, on a standard Xbox, it'll make your eyes bleed. It's become the console I buy all non-exclusive non-online* games on, and with all the work they're doing on backwards-compatibility (which is all free, unlike the PlayStation Now service which doesn't even run on the console itself, but just streams the game across the internet)... I'm happy with it. * If you can play it online, I tend to buy it on the PS4, because that's what 90% of my friends have. But the PS4 Pro is getting a bit silly now - best example is the most recent Witcher 3 patch, which introduces HDR but cocks up the LOD (so you get rocks popping in out of nowhere), amongst other things.",,Chris Davies,United Kingdom,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,M,,,,Microsoft Xbox One X | Page 3,,,

PS3 exclusive, digital only in the west, while PS4 getting some yazuka FOTNS game, that's just a spinoff parody compared to Ken's Rage 2, which is focused on telling the story of the whole manga (well more than any other FOTNS game) with the highest production values and character selection in the series and greatest soundtrack in the series as well. also the western version has more blood/gore than the japanese version. it has the longest story campaign in the series as well with top tier presentation. sure it has some flaws like the a.i. difficulty (though a few put up a fight), and the online multiplayer is not what it should have been, and it would have been the best musou game to include a local versus mode (it has split screen already). though despite its weaknesses, its strengths really make it outshine its predecessor as well as the weird FOTNS game on PS4. so its really one of a kind. Koei probably isn't gonna port it to other platforms, so PS3 gamers seeking a rare beat em up masterpiece exclusive to PS3, FOTNS KR2 is still there. *Hakuoki Stories of the Shinsengumi is another, has some of the most emotional stories, plus PS3 has the definitive version (and looks even better on a bigger screen). so despite being multiplatform, it will still be a rarity to have on console. Otome games are super rare on top of that, so its definitely a game for those that are interested in its themes, plus its a great game to explore without spoilers, it has some really surprising twists and emotional bonds and experiences. Oh yea I think there is a physical edition, but still, the physical edition is so rare now, that people would be fortunate to even own the digital version will they still can get it onto HDD. *Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne there's no telling when and if it's getting a port to a later console. and PS3 is the only place to play it outside of PS2. plus the north american PSN version has less issues than the EU version, so overall, its very playable, and people can accumulate over 90 hours playing through it first time, especially with the TDE path. *Arcana Heart 3 the series seemed to kinda move to PC, very rare fighting game that is the peak of the series, sure there is Love Max, though original Arcana Heart 3 really has better UI. I think it released physical, though still the digital version really is gonna be harder to get after they pull it from the PSN Store. plus its more convenient launching it from the HDD. *Castlevania Harmony of Despair. sure it is on X360, but PS3 has the more definitive edition, exclusively having 4 players local co-op, two extra characters and Chapter 7 that were DLC in X360, the extra characters and Chapters DLC are totally worth it to. one of the hardest games to start solo, and the last Castlevania game IGA was involved with. so you can share other examples of PS3 digital only games that gonna be super rare and worth playing. *Saints Row 2 and 3 I'm not sure if Volition will port them to PS4 without requiring PSNow, but they are definitely among the greatest games to play on PS3. you can share other games you think will be rare and probably won't be on newer platforms anytime soon to own.",,xenosaga123,United States of America,,,Positive,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

For such a person, what is the best option: - Spend 300 euros on a PS4 Pro, enjoy the Sony exclusives and the multiplatform games like Assassins Creed Origins, Far Cry 5, Shadow of War, Rise of Tomb Raider and such at 30 fps. - Spend 3 to 4 times that on an ITX build with an i5 8400, 16gb of ram, an SSD, SFX PSU, GTX 1060 6gb, forget the Sony exclusive games and enjoy the multiplatform games at 60 FPS ultra Settings.

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is one of the only games I play regularly and even though it runs like absolute crap compared to retail games, on a standard Xbox, it'll make your eyes bleed. It's become the console I buy all non-exclusive non-online* games on, and with all the work they're doing on backwards-compatibility (which is all free, unlike the PlayStation Now service which doesn't even run on the console itself, but just streams the game across the internet)... I'm happy with it. * If you can play it online, I tend to buy it on the PS4, because that's what 90% of my friends have.

Today they’re launching the full service with over 750 games, which they claim is more than any other gaming service of this type, including Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Now.

Here are all the games coming soon on PC, and maybe some will come out on Utomik!

The service offers “unlimited PC gaming” for USD$6.99 per month.  For that price you get immediate access to the full library, which includes the likes of the Batman: Arkham series, Saints Row IV, Metro Last Light, and Human: Fall Flat. You can see the full list of games available here.

I was wondering if anyone got the platinum for this game through Playstation now and how you experienced the game through this system. For instance does it feel laggy or anything you can come up with (playing on a ps4/ps4pro). I'll probably start my 7 days free trial to get as many god of war games platinums as I can and if it works flawless I'll maybe even get a month extra for some ps3 games. This question goes out to all god of war games. Thanks for any feedback!,,Deluziion90,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,Experience with PS-now for a platinum,,,

Try to not push yourself too hard if you don't enjoy the games you're playing. I'd recommend trying to complete with a platinum or a 100% the games you love the most first as to get the most enjoyment out of them. I've done that with a couple of games i own honestly, Just most of the game i enjoy a lot are RPG's which in trophies means just a ton of grinding. I've found that an alternative is just to play a game until i get bored of it move on and then come back to it etc. The advice is well welcomed though. 19 hours ago, Durandal said: I know exactly what you mean and it's also the reason why I enjoy playing games on my Playstation now, even more so then I did (or do) on my PC.

It's funny because I'm not a huge fan of the franchise. I played the first one, and pretty much watched a friend play the third one. I was just thinking about how it came out and I had a hankering for the gameplay, but the remasters aren't on PS4 as far as I could find. So I just went ahead and bought it. I'm actually glad I did. The story has been a lot more than I was expecting from a God of War game. preemptive edit: I just looked again I do see a GoW3 Remaster on PS4. Apparently I was too hasty, but when I saw the first two on PS3 and PSNow, I just assumed nothing would be on PS4 aside from the new one.

The addition of PS2 games was announced today, confirming that these are similar to the buy-and-download PS2 Classics already on PlayStation 4, which feature updated resolution and trophy support. So fans that want to replay the games by going for every trophy can do so…

FireDrakeZ posted... uberl33tpro posted... Most of my friends play on Xbox. Even though I got a PC that crushes the Xbox One X, I got it so I could play coop with friends, and the difference in frame rates and visuals on the Xbox One X is in stark contrast to the PS4 on some of the same games I played. It is a good reason to get an Xbox One X if playing with your friends is a priority. I am like you. I have a gaming PC and an Xbox One X and don't own a PS4. For me it is the integration and synergy of owning both an Xbox One X and a Windows 10 PC especially the social aspects that lends the most appeal for having both. The Xbox UI is fully integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft App on a Windows 10 PC and makes it easy to connect with friends and share screenshots, achievements and video sharing on the PC. Mixer now even allows you to share your controller with your friends when you stream. Another cool feature is the Play Anywhere Option. It allows me to shift from one platform(Xbox to PC or vice versa) to another depending upon where I am located while playing the same game and using the saves and achievements from both platforms. It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Some games also allow Cross Platform play between Windows PC and Xbox One, a feature that is generally unavailable or quite limited on other consoles so again the social aspect of playing with your friends on a different platform comes into play. Microsoft in general are moving to make the Xbox One X as close as possible to a PC adding back compatibility(more than 500 games from previous generations), Free Sync(Variable Refresh Rate), Dolby Atmos, Auto low latency mode(to reduce input lag), ability to play 4K HDR, support for 120Hz refresh rate for 1080p and 1440p output resolutions, and plans to add support for some of the features of the HDMI 2.1 standard with the added feature not commonly found on PCs of having a 4K HDR blu ray player included, all for half or less of the price you are going to have to pay for an equivalent PC. It really helps that Microsoft owns both Xbox and the Windows 10 OS architecture. Even the Xbox controllers are recognized natively by Windows 10. Having said that, if you already had the PS4, I would have advised you to keep it just for the exclusives. After that the best versions of multi-platform games as well as their own exclusives in 4K are found on either Xbox One X or PC, including enhanced copies of games from previous generations. You can also still access many of the PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) on your PC by subscribing to PSNow on your gaming PC if necessary. That is one of the reasons I never thought of picking a PS4 up. I can still play most of their exclusives on the PC. If PS5 however adds back compatibility to its features, I might consider getting it in the future. You need to stop lying. All that shilling and then you ruined it with lies. Where did I lie exactly, my friend? I try to list features from actual articles, not just my opinion based on what I own. If you noticed I advised him to keep the PS4 for the exclusives.

The only way I could see this somehow working is if another company had their own video game online store on either consoles. Similar to how you can buy a movie on either vudu or amazon but watch it I guess anywhere that has access to those apps. But Sony and Microsoft wouldn't make money on sales then. Maybe in the future if psnow could play games as well as games on a disc or harddrive could I see this being a thing.

Writing Presented

            PC and console gamers have been bickering since around the 80’s and don’t seem to be stopping anytime soon. On one side there are fans of an expensive, multipurpose machine that allows amazing and endless customization – if you have the time and expertise, and on the other side are advocates of a cheaper alternative with high-end exclusive games that does just one thing and possibly for a shorter period than you thought. Despite the people on each side of the board, most gamers will agree that each of them offers their own pros and cons. Most people’s preferences are based on the amount of money you have, what kind of games you like to play and how much tolerance you have for doing your own tech support for either. Just like all arguments, I chose to side with the PC gamers one this one as I have been one for most if not all my life. It is also a focus on just the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 of consoles vs PC’s. 

            Let’s start with the prices, PC gaming is expensive. You can find some cheap pre-builds for less than 500 bucks but for gaming, you need to step it up a little because you don’t want to play on specs that looked good 5 years ago. You can also just go straight for all of it and spend a few thousand dollars on the newest video cards when they come out, the best processor every year, as much RAM as possible that will fit into your computer and maybe even a nice case. Either way, you aren’t going to be able to get a quality gaming PC for the same price as a console (between $250-$500) very easily. The current competitive price for a “good” computer is around $600-$900 and over $1,200 can get you a spectacular computer, these prices are based off Reddit and Tom’s Hardware. Computers aren’t bad investments because a decent computer at the low end of the price range could easily cover the price of a PS4 or Xbox One, another controller and a pretty large amount of games. All this basically assumes that you want to do all the building yourself because pre-built systems cost more based on the fact that you don’t have to construct it yourself and you have access to tech support if something goes wrong. On the other hand, consoles get cheaper as they are out longer but usually stay within $100 of its starting price as long as it is the current generation. An original Xbox One or PS4 will set you back about $250-$300 with the 4K variants setting you back just a little more with the Xbox One X being $500 for just the console and a controller and the PS4 Pro is $400. These prices also tend to drop during good sales. This may just make it sound like PC’s are just a giant waste of money for it to be decent and console gaming is a dream come true for someone who doesn’t want to spend a ton of money, but that was only the prices of these machines. When it comes to the actual games, PC’s have a gigantic advantage over consoles on this one primarily because of Steam, the primary seller of digital games has a lot of sales and a vast selection of indie games and others. Console games tend to stay at higher prices for a longer time and go on sale much less frequently. 

            PC blows consoles out of the water with their vast game selection, with big budget titles, indie fare and classic games, PC’s have an amazing selection. Whether you are buying the latest Assassin’s Creed game from Steam or running something else to relive a classic from your childhood, it’s pretty easy to get a variety of titles on your PC fast because the library goes back almost 30 years. PS4 and Xbox One libraries don’t go back nearly as far, you can play some PS3 games because of PlayStation Now and some Xbox 360 games thanks to the backwards compatibility. Usually though you get limited to the games that have come out in the past few years. A lot of middle tier studios won’t usually bother releasing console games: even more indie studios stick with PC because they can reach the broadest possible audience by sticking to just PC and not paying the extra money to port the games on console. Then there’s the huge boon that console manufacturers have; exclusives franchises. You need a PS4 to play God of War or you need and Xbox One to play Halo. Some of this generations greatest titles are unfortunately console exclusives, including Sunset Overdrive, Bloodborne, Halo 5 and Horizon Zero Dawn. Microsoft has been trying real hard to get PC equanimity in recent years, so Xbox exclusivity may no longer be a problem in the near future. But if you want to play Ratchet and Clank or Uncharted, PS4 would be the choice of console for you.

            One of the main arguments that is in favor of PC gaming is the graphics, as the hardware inside of an amazing gaming PC can far outperform the parts in an Xbox One or PS4. Players on PC can play games with graphics settings set to higher levels, as well as play at higher, smoother frame rates than that on a console. This is also where pricing comes into play and how much money you really want to spend to be able to play video games. Better graphics and smoother gameplay are available if you are willing to pay and at the same time you save money in the long run on PC because of the amount of games that you have access to all the time. The PS4 Pro and Xbox One X can display 4K resolutions with HDR color technology which is impressive. But PC gamers have had those options for years, with way more granular control over things like textures, lighting and sometimes even how much a character’s hair blows in the wind. There is no doubt about it thought, a decently powerful PC can display way better graphics than the consoles and a very powerful one could blow them away.

            The biggest deciding factor in choosing between a console and a PC is how much legwork you are okay with doing. While consoles are becoming more computer-like each and every generation, they’re still very simple to use. You simply slide a disc into the tray or download a title from the one and only digital store that they have, and then play your game. You can also download some entertainment apps and go on the internet to surf the web and if you are really ambitious, you can route your tv receiver through your Xbox and watch television using your Xbox. That’s pretty much it. But the upside to a console is if something goes wrong with it, it’s almost always very easy to fix. Usually reinstalling software and clearing the cache will solve a lot of problems or factory resetting to possibly fix more severe problems, if all else fails you can call up Sony or Microsoft and they will repair your device under warranty. If it’s out of warranty though, they will most likely charge you for whatever they may do to it. “On a PC, Murphy’s law is in full effect: Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong at the worst possible time”. With so many different parts, hundreds of drivers and tons of interacting software, solving a problem in a computer often consists of a lot of trial and error, assuming you can even figure out what your issue or issues are in the first place. You sit down after a long day and a game refuses to start up, so you contact the game maker, which might then direct you to Microsoft, then to the Xbox division, which might just end up leading you back to the game’s maker and stressing you out. Posting on Reddit can often produce better results as well as Tom’s hardware, but it’s hard for responders to figure out a problem remotely and from far away. And usually it takes a few hours before you can fix your problem. You might have to play around in your registry, your file settings or even your BIOS. More times than not, things go wrong for absolutely no reason at all and fixing them is a long and exhausting process. Hardcore PC users and gamers sometimes claim that situations like this will only pop up if you act hastily or don’t treat your computer right. In my experience this isn’t true, I keep very good care of my computer by cleaning it once a week and I have pieces just go on me whenever they don’t want to work anymore. If you own a PC long enough it will eventually betray you, it’s not the end of the world but it happens to people all the time. Some good news though, most PC problems are fixable. Even if something in your computer hardware is broken, you can open up your own system and replace the broken piece yourself without a lot of trouble. Even if you buy a pre-built, you will be doing most of your own repairs more often than not.

            Even though I am a PC player, I can never get enough of sitting on the couch with your friends and playing video games together, you can do that on PC but its not the same, you must sit in a chair and stare at screens and not be able to really sit back and relax. Both consoles and PC’s allow you play multiplayer games but like I said, the functionality isn’t really the same on both types of systems. On the other hand, PC’s have an advantage in online multiplayer. To play games online on PS4 or Xbox One, the player would have to subscribe to Sony’s or Microsoft’s online services which are, PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold respectively, and these tend to be $60 a year or more if you pay monthly. While Plus and Gold include many extra perks, like cloud storage and a ton of games, it’s still a cost that is unknown to many PC gamers. Unless you play a game that has a monthly subscription charge like Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft.",,marrisjcom350,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,PC vs Console,Post,,

The PS4 is at what, 80 units sold? So that's barely 1/8th of PS4 owners who will buy that game... a minority.... I guess by your own logic then GOW is worthless because the majority of PS4 owners did not buy it nor will play it daily. All you have proven is how faulty your logic is. The user count is a much larger factor with BC hardware as everybody has to pay, regardless if they are using it or not. The rest of the products you have listed are strictly user based. It wouldn't bother me, but it's tough to convince 60 million people to pay for something only 5-10 million people are going to use. Damn good argument. No, it's not. Why should people that only want to buy digital games pay for an optical drive? Once the data shows only a small percent of users are using the optical drive, we should start to see digital only consoles.

Because of how the PS3 processor was designed and because of how powerful it is, PS3 emulation is impossible on the PS4, which is why the games are streamed. You wouldn’t be able to dl them and have them actually work. Like I said, I'm not too keen on the backward compatibility bit here and willing to forgo it as well. However, the whole concept of streaming game and not downloading them, that's the big issue here. I mean I can understand streaming for movie content as it's restrictive in it's length, but games would probably have numerous factors involved to deliver a clean unhindered 1080p resolution experience consistently. Considering people with 100Mb/s connection and upwards have reported issues with this service should be a good indicator of it's instability. Also, PSNow is not available in all countries, not to mention the charge being $20 a month in US.

173530409798,5/2/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/173530409798,"With just about a month to go before E3 2018 kicks off, Microsoft is continuing to tease what’s in store for its briefing at the big-time gaming show. After suggesting that games from Japanese publishers will be on stage, Microsoft has now teased its showing even more. In a blog post today, Microsoft’s Mike Nichols said the company has a “great briefing filled with new games” on tap.

“We’re hard at work on exciting plans for E3, from what will be a great briefing filled with new games to the fan experience at the Microsoft Theater,” Nichols said. “This is our biggest E3 yet, and we look forward to a great week for gamers. Again, thank you to the amazing Xbox community.”

Microsoft’s E3 2018 briefing takes place on Sunday, June 11, starting at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET. Whereas last year we knew that Xbox One X (then Project Scorpio) would be a major highlight, we know relatively less about this year’s show. 

In January, Spencer said that there would be some “positive changes” at E3 for Microsoft, which could have been a reference to the company’s decision to hire out the nearby Microsoft Theatre. Microsoft will still have a presence on the E3 show floor, but it will be dedicated to Mixer exclusively, while the rest of the activities take place across the street in the Microsoft Theatre. 

One possible announcement from Microsoft this year is Halo 6, which has been discussed but not formally revealed. Microsoft is also said to be working on a PlayStation Now-like game-streaming service. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on E3 2018 in the days and weeks ahead. 

In other E3 news, The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red has confirmed it will attend E3 this year. Intriguingly, the Polish studio might be talking about an unspecified RPG at the show.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"Xbox E3 2018 Briefing Will Include ""New Games"" And More",Post,,

Rather than feel like it enhances certain games, I feel like it's outright necessary for them. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is one of the only games I play regularly and even though it runs like absolute crap compared to retail games, on a standard Xbox, it'll make your eyes bleed. It's become the console I buy all non-exclusive non-online* games on, and with all the work they're doing on backwards-compatibility (which is all free, unlike the PlayStation Now service which doesn't even run on the console itself, but just streams the game across the internet)... I'm happy with it. * If you can play it online, I tend to buy it on the PS4, because that's what 90% of my friends have.

As you said, A semi-custom 7nm Ryzen mobile chip based on the Zen 2 and Navi architecture with a power draw of 10-15w would be on par with the OG PS4 performance wise, but such a chip would also have much higher thermals than a ARM chip like the one found in the switch, so it will be better suited to a tablet than a small portable device like the switch. The question then becomes, do Microsoft and Sony want to make tablet versions of the Xb1 and PS4. The answer to that isn't as positive. The upside to such an idea is that sales won't matter as much, since it wouldn't be a new platform, it would just be a portable version of an existing platform. There also wouldn't be problems getting games on such a system since the entire console library would be there out of the box. I'm also assuming such a device would be digital only, so they could justify costs as a way to get more people purchasing games directly through PSN/XBL. Crossbuy would also be an incentive. Sony could call it a PS4 Tablet, Microsoft could leverage it's surface line for branding and call it something like the Surface Xbox. Problems however come when you want to actually look at the details. Even though I said sales of such a device wouldn't matter as much, they would still matter. A Semi-custom 7nm chip Costs around $250m alone to design and produce. Also, the biggest hurdle isn't processing power like you think, it's memory/storage. How are you going to fit all these games on such a device? Ideally you would want a minimum 256gb of storage built in with options to expand storage through SD cards. Even then 256gb is expensive. PS4 also uses gddr5 memory, which is very power consuming, takes up a lot of space and produces heat as well. HBM could fix this but that also would add a large amount to manufacturing costs. Lastly, the price. Such a device won't be $399 if launched next year or the year after. It can't be sold at a profit that way. It would have to cost $499-599 minimum, and at that price how many people are actually going to buy it? I mean, I would be there Day 1, but other than me? Are the development costs and troubles worth the sales they'll end up recieving? I don't think Microsoft are interested in making a portable device at all. As for Sony, every time they are questioned about a new one, while they avoid flat out saying they'll never make a new portable their messaging indicates that it's not a current concern. Most likely, both companies will get into the portable market years from now through streaming services like PSNow and GamePass, when 5G wireless connections are mainstream. TL;DR I doubt they will because they won't gain substantially from doing so, but it's not impossible.",,Jordamuk,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

173474994338,5/1/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/173474994338,"E3 2018 is coming up relatively soon, and now we’ve learned more about what to expect from Microsoft’s Xbox briefing at the big-time gaming show. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said on Twitter this week that you can expect Microsoft to show off some games from Japanese publishers on its stage. That’s the plan right now, but Spencer noted that plans can change.

“As of now, yes,” Spencer said to a fan who asked if JRPGs would get stage time. “Things can change, but like last year, I wanted to make sure we supported our Japanese publishers on our stage and this year we are working to do the same. It’s important to us.”

As of now, yes. Things can change but like last year I wanted to make sure we supported our Japanese publishers on our stage and this year we are working to do the same. It’s important to us.
 — Phil Spencer (@XboxP3) April 29, 2018
That’s all he had to say on the subject. It’s not much, but it’s nice to see Microsoft’s commitment to talking about and showing off Japanese games during the year’s biggest show. We will of course have all the news from E3 in June as the show unfolds. Last year, Microsoft’s E3 briefing included games from Japanese publishers such as Code Vein and Dragon Ball FighterZ.

Also on Twitter this week, Spencer said Microsoft’s post-E3 plans this year will be “a bit different” than what fans have become accustomed to. “I think people will like it assuming it lands,” he said, offering no further information or teases about this.

We are working on a plan this year that’s a bit different post E3. I think people will like it assuming it lands. And I’m on a plane to the east coast today so a lot of time in the seat to type :-)
 — Phil Spencer (@XboxP3) April 29, 2018
Following E3 is San Diego Comic-Con in July, where Microsoft typically has some kind of presence one way or another. Then in August it’s Gamescom in Germany, where Microsoft usually goes big; and then it’s Tokyo Game Show in September. Microsoft doesn’t always attend that show.

Microsoft’s E3 2018 briefing takes place on Sunday, June 11, starting at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET. Whereas last year we knew that Xbox One X (then Project Scorpio) would be a major highlight, this year’s show remains more of a mystery.

In January, Spencer said that there would be some “positive changes” at E3 for Microsoft, which could have been a reference to the company’s decision to hire out the Microsoft Theatre. One possible announcement from Microsoft this year is Halo 6, which has been discussed but not formally revealed. Microsoft is also said to be working on a PlayStation Now-like game-streaming service.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,"Xbox E3 2018 Briefing Will Show Support For Games From Japanese Publishers, Spencer Says",Post,,

It wouldn't bother me, but it's tough to convince 60 million people to pay for something only 5-10 million people are going to use. Damn good argument. No, it's not. Why should people that only want to buy digital games pay for an optical drive?",,AldenDegrit,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

How, just download the service, like Playstation Now on a compatible price, generally pay a fee and play it like any other game. Why is for multiple reasons. You don't need to wait to download the full game, it takes no space on your hard drive and you can play PS3 games on the PS4 for example. The good part is with a monthly fee like Playstation Now has, you can play a game you thought might be fun, not enjoy it and only waste time not money by playing it as you can switch games as often as you want.

Where did I lie exactly, my friend? I try to list features from actual articles listing the various features added on by Microsoft, not just my opinion based on what I own. If you noticed I advised him to keep the PS4 for the exclusives.",,FireDrakeZ,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

Thought I got to it fast enough! I agree 100% on PSNow. The pricing was (and is) outrageous. And they're wasting time having PS4's stream PS4games. Just let them be downloaded and run locally. It unloads your PSNow servers, and delivers a better experience. Save streaming for PS1-2-3 games, and for streaming PS4 games to non-PS4 devices (do they still HAVE those?) I agree, the lack of BC didn't hurt because XB also failed to deliver it until it was too late. IMO had XB1 ad BC as originally planned (the had to delay work on BC to rebuild the OS to not be always-online, iirc) then I think we'd have seen more influence.... Unfortunately XB also skewered itself with less power AND a higher price (idiots) with a peripheral nobody asked for... So we'd still see a big confirmation bias ""BC doesn't matter!"" even though two larger factors were also in play. I do, however, think that BC is more compelling now than ever before. Were PS4 able to deliver BC in the way XB1 can you have two things that make it different from the past: 1. PS3 games are far less date, technologically, than PS2 games were when PS3 was in. Just straight up diminishing returns there. 2. You can deliver patches to improve that gap further. Old games can stay even *more* current that way, helping residual sales. 3. People *feel good* being able to keep their collection, so it reducing the pull to move to the other platform at a generational transition. *(that's an actual selling point.

It’ll be great to have all the Street Fighter games (epecially Alpha 2) on a console that I actually use. Believe it or not, this is the first time the PC has had anything better than a dos port of these games (or anything at all!) Ok,there are emulators, but those things are so clunky and crash-prone that I don’t even bother. Dark Souls Remastered - Because Souls. And GSilver is addicted to Soulsgames. The plan here is day-one Steam purchase (since it’s half off for owners of the original port) and I’ll pick up the Switch version if it goes on sale around the time I’m planning on a long trip. Spyro Collection - I dunno if I want to get it on the PS4, Xbox One, or wait a year+ for a PC version... I’ll probably get the console version if it runs at 60FPS on the PS4 Pro. But anyway, I liked Spyro 1 a lot back in the day, though I oddly didn’t finish 2 or 3. Overload - How could I not be hyped for the true successor to Descent? Mechwarrior 5 - I’ve wanted to get into the mechwarrior series for so long, and this one looks like it could be a ton of fun. I mechs. Budget Cuts - The full version of the best VR demo that I’ve played! I’m waiting for the reviews, but if it’s good, I *really* want to dive into this Freedom Planet 2 - What was my favorite game of 2014, and is one of my favorite games of all time? Hint: This one is the sequel. ...and there are lots of other games that I wouldn’t mind playing, but these are the only ones I’m geunuinely hyped for. ====================::==================== https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnow/ Doesn't that A) stream to PC and B) include TLOU?",,east1226,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,What games are you looking forward to?,,,

I finished the first level and was left with zero desire to keep playing. This has to be one of the most frustrating, badly designed, opening levels I have ever had the misfortune to suffer through. That end level hydra boss, what a fucking pain in the ass. Just like in the 2018 God of War, it is a fairly basic and easy battle but they just add bullshit in to pad it out. First is the stupid shit where the Hydra can blow you off the screen, it doesn't kill you, it just means you have to climb back up to face him again, secondly is the button tapping shit to move to the next part of the stage, I had to lay the controller flat and smash my hand on it just to hit the button enough times to trigger the animation. I also don't know whether it is a latency issue with PlayStation Now or whether it is an issue with the game but there was always a slight delay after each button press and in a game like this if the controls aren't perfectly synced then it just makes everything needlessly annoying. That isn't even mentioning all the other bullshit like where you gotta walk across planks of wood really slowly, or you'll slip off and suffer instadeath. Like why have I even gotta do this shit? I am the fucking Champion of the Gods, the Ghost of Sparta, I know I don't know my true nature at this point in the story but still I should be fucking leaping between these fucking boats, not daintily wobbling my way between them. Fuck. This is fucking God of War, why the fuck am I pushing a fucking crate around and climbing ropes and all this other shit? For the love of fuck. The amount of times in this one level where I just threw my hands up in the air in pure frustration not through challenge but just in that the game is built upon inconvenience mechanics. It is so frustrating because just like with 2018 GoW, the developers of the game take awesome mythology, fun combat mechanics and then just bloat the whole thing out with fucking bullshit?

Xbox E3 2018 Briefing Teased By Microsoft





With just about a month to go before E3 2018 kicks off, Microsoft is continuing to tease what’s in store for its briefing at the big-time gaming show. After suggesting that games from Japanese publishers will be on stage, Microsoft has now teased its showing even more. In a blog post today, Microsoft’s Mike Nichols said the company has a “great briefing filled with new games” on tap.

“We’re hard at work on exciting plans for E3, from what will be a great briefing filled with new games to the fan experience at the Microsoft Theater,” Nichols said. “This is our biggest E3 yet, and we look forward to a great week for gamers. Again, thank you to the amazing Xbox community.”

Microsoft’s E3 2018 briefing takes place on Sunday, June 11, starting at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET. Whereas last year we knew that Xbox One X (then Project Scorpio) would be a major highlight, we know relatively less about this year’s show. 

In January, Spencer said that there would be some “positive changes” at E3 for Microsoft, which could have been a reference to the company’s decision to hire out the nearby Microsoft Theatre. Microsoft will still have a presence on the E3 show floor, but it will be dedicated to Mixer exclusively, while the rest of the activities take place across the street in the Microsoft Theatre. 

One possible announcement from Microsoft this year is Halo 6, which has been discussed but not formally revealed. Microsoft is also said to be working on a PlayStation Now-like game-streaming service. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on E3 2018 in the days and weeks ahead. 

In other E3 news, The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red has confirmed it will attend E3 this year. Intriguingly, the Polish studio might be talking about an unspecified RPG at the show.

But if you expect that going in you might be surprised how great the gameplay holds up. It hasn't changed significantly over the years, mostly quality of life improvements and better flow in combat and improved targeting. If you have access to a PS3 and those games or you can use PSNow for 4 & 5 I would recommend doing that before playing 6. One thing I do caution with this series is try not to play them back to back. Each game is pretty long and there is definitely some recycled material like some of the minigames, so if you burn yourself out, you will probably dislike what you're playing and try to rush it or quit and miss out on some great stuff. Pace yourself.",,KoroshiyaZero,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

(playing on Psnow) Now I'm not looking for things that are remastered on PS4 already. So PS3 exclusives only! Currently I'm busy with my God of War marathon but It's going way faster as expected so I'm already on the look for some new games Currently I've got my eyes on Sly Cooper and marathon all those games. But any other titles that I should really look out for? No racing/fighting or Jrpg suggestions for the rest I'm very open minded ====================::==================== You and I seem to have a similar taste in games. I went through your games and we have a lot in common, and there's about 20 in my backlog that you also completed. It's harder to recommend games to you as many of them will be very hard to 100%, despite having easier platinums. Consider: - Batman: Arkham Asylum and City (solid games) - God of War 1 and 2 (really good) - Lego Lord of the Rings (quick and easy, not buggy, good for couples) - the first Ratchet and Clank trilogy (if you are interested in Sly and Crash, this may be in line with your interests) - Red Dead Redemption is mint, but the multiplayer can eat one.",,GonzoWARgasm,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,PS3 - Must play games,,,

It's become the console I buy all non-exclusive non-online* games on, and with all the work they're doing on backwards-compatibility (which is all free, unlike the PlayStation Now service which doesn't even run on the console itself, but just streams the game across the internet)... I'm happy with it. * If you can play it online, I tend to buy it on the PS4, because that's what 90% of my friends have.

They already said they are trying to target for autumn of 2018. @Enragedhydra said: @commander said: you ignore the fact that consoles have a lot of advantages too, not having to bother with hackers is one of them, and if you want to play with a controller vs controllers then the pc is already useless. Not to mention the convenience of a console... oh and have fun playing games like monster hunter, or rdr2 for that matter. Have fun playing Divinity Original Sin 2 or the new Pillars of Eternity II or will you give the stupid argument that you don't care about those games? Monster Hunter is coming to PC and we will get a better version of it. More convenience? I press the start button on my PC, I press the Steam Icon, I hit the launch button and my game starts, you press the start button on your console and find the game and launch the game, there is no difference. If you look at the stats hacking is not a big issue. Anyone that owns a gaming headset on PC has a mic. Consoles have to update games as well. Most of those points on the PC side are nonsense and have been debunked over and over again so there is no point when you can do a google search. Invalid cd key... dear God how old is that picture. If we get serious there are 0 benefits to owning a console, PC does everything better. Steam has built in chat and you can chat even when playing different games, Battlenet also has built in chat. Do you know what I use Skype for? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Just because your to retarded to figure out how to use a PC doesn't mean everybody else is. I have been a pc technician and network admistrator by trade, and a console is still more convenient, it's not because you or me are adept enough with a pc that everyone else is. If you are that smart how could you have missed that ... and who cares what you want or what you find important. Your preferences don't mean anything in system wars. It's not because of your preferences that the xbox doesn't have any advantages compared to the other systems. People couldn't care less you can wait for rdr or monster hunter, some people want to play it now, or want to play controller vs controller. Some prefer the centralization of xbox live other the decentralization of the pc platform. A pc is no console, and it never will be. It's no substitute for xbox, it's the reason why the xbox became so popular.

I'm super excited as I haven't ever been outside my state for over 8 days, so 70 days is going to be a big change. Why this is relevant is that I will not be taking my consoles with me besides the vita, so my gaming habits will be changing. I still hope to continue my trophy-a-day streak, but I probably won't be keeping a small backlog of games like I am now, but rather I will just have my vita backlog available. I'm also considering getting Playstation Now while I'm abroad so I can play games on my PC, but I won't be making any final decision on that until I get there.

[Some googling found this for a source on attach rate](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/60082/ps4-sales-surpass-70-million-units-massive-attach-rate/index.html). The math in there works out to abouth 9 games per system. Average game size is harder, some are ludicrously huge, others not. Looking at my PS4, HZD is 49.8 (w/Frozen Wilds) Witcher 3 os 42.3, Fallout 4 is 37.36, 49.1 for Nier:Automata, 11.61, Tides of Numenera is 16.2, No Man's Sky is 11.6, Battlefront is 29.6, Little Big Planet 3 is 14.68. I just deleted two The Show game installs that were rentals, both wrere 50-51. In my use case, that's about 35.19gb per average, 351.9. With sundry apps and games, my total was 365.6gb with 10 games installed, or one more than the average attach rate. My 500gb PS4 has 408.5 actually available, so I could fit one more good sized game on there before needing to clear space (which I have now done). But the other thing to consider is Black Ops 3 is 101gb, Infinite War is 95gb. [But per this list of biggest games I'm basing this on from last July, Nier Automata is still in there with 49.1](https://www.gamesradar.com/biggest-ps4-install-size-games/), so I think my spread's not that far off. So, with that in mind, there's room for about 11 good sized games on the PS4, or take two of those games and combine it into #9 for in massive game. You're still at the average attach rate without having to uninstall anything and have the full suite of apps (and considering one of those for me is PSNow, I have a lot more games to play). [PS5 is speculated for 2020](https://www.vg247.com/2018/04/27/ps5-release-date-specs-games-features/), and 7 years makes sense to me for the life of the platform, so even if it bleeds into 2021 we're fairly late cycle. I don't think it's really necessary to have an external hard drive for a 500gb unless you're a particularly heavy gamer and you don't stream, or uninstall games you're not really playing. I myself had never run up against it as an issue, only reason I knew I was getting close is because I opened up my storage to pull numbers for this. For a statistically average gamer, 500gb seems to be sufficient.",,OckhamsFolly,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Reddit,,,,,,,,

The games are actually running on original hardware in Sony's server farm, and the video is sent to your device, so this is heavily reliant on your internet connection. Originally, PSNow was only available on Sony hardware, but they eventually released a PC app. This means that a lot of console titles, including games like Red Dead Redemption and many PlayStation exclusives, are now playable on PC, with the caveat that they're not technically running on your PC. If you have a decent internet connection, I'd say it's worth a shot. You could get to play games like The Last of Us, for example. The main problem, I'd say, is that they only recently started adding PS4 games, so the selection is kind of pathetic at this point. However, there is a very large catalog of PS3 games and PS2 games that were remastered for PS3.",,chris2315,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Reddit,,,,,,,,

Discharged19DCS posted... FireDrakeZ posted... uberl33tpro posted... Most of my friends play on Xbox. Even though I got a PC that crushes the Xbox One X, I got it so I could play coop with friends, and the difference in frame rates and visuals on the Xbox One X is in stark contrast to the PS4 on some of the same games I played. It is a good reason to get an Xbox One X if playing with your friends is a priority. I am like you. I have a gaming PC and an Xbox One X and don't own a PS4. For me it is the integration and synergy of owning both an Xbox One X and a Windows 10 PC especially the social aspects that lends the most appeal for having both. The Xbox UI is fully integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft App on a Windows 10 PC and makes it easy to connect with friends and share screenshots, achievements and video sharing on the PC. Mixer now even allows you to share your controller with your friends when you stream. Another cool feature is the Play Anywhere Option. It allows me to shift from one platform(Xbox to PC or vice versa) to another depending upon where I am located while playing the same game and using the saves and achievements from both platforms. It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Some games also allow Cross Platform play between Windows PC and Xbox One, a feature that is generally unavailable or quite limited on other consoles so again the social aspect of playing with your friends on a different platform comes into play. Microsoft in general are moving to make the Xbox One X as close as possible to a PC adding back compatibility(more than 500 games from previous generations), Free Sync(Variable Refresh Rate), Dolby Atmos, Auto low latency mode(to reduce input lag), ability to play 4K HDR, support for 120Hz refresh rate for 1080p and 1440p output resolutions, and plans to add support for some of the features of the HDMI 2.1 standard with the added feature not commonly found on PCs of having a 4K HDR blu ray player included, all for half or less of the price you are going to have to pay for an equivalent PC. It really helps that Microsoft owns both Xbox and the Windows 10 OS architecture. Even the Xbox controllers are recognized natively by Windows 10. Having said that, if you already had the PS4, I would have advised you to keep it just for the exclusives. After that the best versions of multi-platform games as well as their own exclusives in 4K are found on either Xbox One X or PC, including enhanced copies of games from previous generations. You can also still access many of the PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) on your PC by subscribing to PSNow on your gaming PC if necessary. That is one of the reasons I never thought of picking a PS4 up. I can still play most of their exclusives on the PC. If PS5 however adds back compatibility to its features, I might consider getting it in the future. You need to stop lying. All that shilling and then you ruined it with lies. Where did I lie exactly, my friend? I try to list features from actual articles, not just my opinion based on what I own. If you noticed I advised him to keep the PS4 for the exclusives. Look at the bolded part. It’s a lie. You know it’s a lie. Stop lying. I see. Thanks for pointing out where you thought I lied. We can discuss that further. PSNow is available for PC gamers and it list a lot of PS3 and PS4 exclusives including the Last of Us, the Uncharted series, Shadow of the Colossus and older God of War games. Obviously the newer games are not yet available as I already pointed out at this time.

They could at least release a ps1/ps2 classic system like nintendo did with NES and SNES. but they are just doing nothing as well as having no backwards compatibility. just letting the past die. meanwhile in the movie and books industries they preserve their pasts. This needs to be rectified. I think you're missing the point. Sony doesn't want the past to die, they just don't want you having easy access to it unless you pay them extra money. After all, the past is great and everything, but it's better when it can be used for additional profits. They can't sell you something you already own.

My only gripe with PSNow is that it is very quick at cutting you out at the slightest slowdown. IN addition to plats, you can use it to 100% games that you don't want to pay for DLC. I did this for Saint's Row 3, Enslaved and The Force Unleashed.

Discharged19DCS posted... FireDrakeZ posted... uberl33tpro posted... Most of my friends play on Xbox. Even though I got a PC that crushes the Xbox One X, I got it so I could play coop with friends, and the difference in frame rates and visuals on the Xbox One X is in stark contrast to the PS4 on some of the same games I played. It is a good reason to get an Xbox One X if playing with your friends is a priority. I am like you. I have a gaming PC and an Xbox One X and don't own a PS4. For me it is the integration and synergy of owning both an Xbox One X and a Windows 10 PC especially the social aspects that lends the most appeal for having both. The Xbox UI is fully integrated with the Xbox/Microsoft App on a Windows 10 PC and makes it easy to connect with friends and share screenshots, achievements and video sharing on the PC. Mixer now even allows you to share your controller with your friends when you stream. Another cool feature is the Play Anywhere Option. It allows me to shift from one platform(Xbox to PC or vice versa) to another depending upon where I am located while playing the same game and using the saves and achievements from both platforms. It also allows me to play with friends on either platform. Some games also allow Cross Platform play between Windows PC and Xbox One, a feature that is generally unavailable or quite limited on other consoles so again the social aspect of playing with your friends on a different platform comes into play. Microsoft in general are moving to make the Xbox One X as close as possible to a PC adding back compatibility(more than 500 games from previous generations), Free Sync(Variable Refresh Rate), Dolby Atmos, Auto low latency mode(to reduce input lag), ability to play 4K HDR, support for 120Hz refresh rate for 1080p and 1440p output resolutions, and plans to add support for some of the features of the HDMI 2.1 standard with the added feature not commonly found on PCs of having a 4K HDR blu ray player included, all for half or less of the price you are going to have to pay for an equivalent PC. It really helps that Microsoft owns both Xbox and the Windows 10 OS architecture. Even the Xbox controllers are recognized natively by Windows 10. Having said that, if you already had the PS4, I would have advised you to keep it just for the exclusives. After that the best versions of multi-platform games as well as their own exclusives in 4K are found on either Xbox One X or PC, including enhanced copies of games from previous generations. You can also still access many of the PS3 and PS4 exclusives(except the latest ones) on your PC by subscribing to PSNow on your gaming PC if necessary. That is one of the reasons I never thought of picking a PS4 up. I can still play most of their exclusives on the PC. If PS5 however adds back compatibility to its features, I might consider getting it in the future. You need to stop lying. All that shilling and then you ruined it with lies. Where did I lie exactly, my friend? I try to list features from actual articles, not just my opinion based on what I own. If you noticed I advised him to keep the PS4 for the exclusives. Look at the bolded part. It’s a lie. You know it’s a lie. Stop lying. I see. Thanks for pointing out where you thought I lied. We can discuss that further. PSNow is available for PC gamers and it list a lot of PS3 and PS4 exclusives including the Last of Us, the Uncharted series, Shadow of the Colossus and older God of War games. Obviously the newer games are not yet available as I already pointed out. Where did I lie then in my statements? https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnow/ This is news to me.

RDR can already be played on PC as I said above and it is a matter of time for RDR2 through PSNow, do you know how much money Capcom would lose if it canceled Monster Hunter World on PC? They already said they are trying to target for autumn of 2018. @Enragedhydra said: @commander said: you ignore the fact that consoles have a lot of advantages too, not having to bother with hackers is one of them, and if you want to play with a controller vs controllers then the pc is already useless. Not to mention the convenience of a console... oh and have fun playing games like monster hunter, or rdr2 for that matter. Have fun playing Divinity Original Sin 2 or the new Pillars of Eternity II or will you give the stupid argument that you don't care about those games? Monster Hunter is coming to PC and we will get a better version of it. More convenience? I press the start button on my PC, I press the Steam Icon, I hit the launch button and my game starts, you press the start button on your console and find the game and launch the game, there is no difference. If you look at the stats hacking is not a big issue. Anyone that owns a gaming headset on PC has a mic. Consoles have to update games as well. Most of those points on the PC side are nonsense and have been debunked over and over again so there is no point when you can do a google search. Invalid cd key... dear God how old is that picture. If we get serious there are 0 benefits to owning a console, PC does everything better. Steam has built in chat and you can chat even when playing different games, Battlenet also has built in chat. Do you know what I use Skype for? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Just because your to retarded to figure out how to use a PC doesn't mean everybody else is. I have been a pc technician and network admistrator by trade, and a console is still more convenient, it's not because you or me are adept enough with a pc that everyone else is. If you are that smart how could you have missed that ... and who cares what you want or what you find important. Your preferences don't mean anything in system wars. It's not because of your preferences that the xbox doesn't have any advantages compared to the other systems. People couldn't care less you can wait for rdr or monster hunter, some people want to play it now, or want to play controller vs controller. Some prefer the centralization of xbox live other the decentralization of the pc platform. A pc is no console, and it never will be. It's no substitute for xbox, it's the reason why the xbox became so popular. Everyone knows it's the pc dude console. and hackers are a problem on the pc, this isn't exactly a secret. As long I continue to fix my relative's PCs for free, Xbox is fine. @jereb31 said: @recloud said: @jereb31: if it ran thin, you wouldn't have the consoles market as successful as it is. It's easier to buy a console and play a game on console that it is on PC. On PC you have to buy the parts, build it, buy os, install os, update os, install all the drivers from the hardware to work, update the GPU driver, install steam, update steam, download game, install game. On console, at least on ps4. You turn the PS4 on, it downloads and installs the latest OS, the game is ready to play in under 5s, if it needs. to be updated, it'll download and install the minute you insert the disc. Consoles are way more convenient and absurdly cheaper than PC. Consoles success is not entirely at the expense of PC convenience. Granted it is easy to just plug a console into a wall and tv then go. But you can do the exact same thing for a PC, you never had to put one together if you didn't want to, buying a pre-built has always remained an option if you want to spend the money. Which means the only other step you have to do is install steam. All drivers and updates have been automated for close to a decade. ""the game is ready to play in under 5s"" <- Lol, consoles are infamous for day 1 patches and insanely slow network downloads. Consoles are no more convenient than PC, and can be cheaper than PC. But a console, 9/10's, offers a lesser experience to a PC version of a game. System maintenance on Xbox One is Microsoft's responsibility while Window PC's system maintenance is end user's responsibility. I have one of my old-timer relative toasted His Windows PC with fake PC cleaner tool that wiped out the network stack and killed ""Reset PC"" function. Guess who gets called up to fix it? I'm tempted to push Him towards MacOS so He can stop bugging me. My other relatives has MacOS + iOS+ PS4 combo and I rarely get involve with maintaining their machines..",,ronvalencia,United States of America,,,Positive,Anger,Forums,,,,,,,,

It's far outpaced by development in processing and wireless connectivity, because pure chemistry is a lot harder to innovate on. If the clients stay low powered, and we push all the processing to the cloud, we could have devices that be always on.

Lack of BC really is a shame and Sony ought to be more honest instead of blaming consumers. Truth is that there are two reasons for no BC. 1) Cynically, it would interfere with PSNow streaming service. Who the f*** wants to buy games there when you can just pop in an old disk? It would probably ruin PSNow and Sony knows it. Reselling games is good source of income, I guess. 2) It might have been an expensive feature to add into the PS4 and after the PS3s debacle, so Sony didn't want to take the risk. Instead, it would put out cheaper hardware and focus more on games, which seems to have worked (though it might also be because MS s*** itself). Alternatively, say adding BC makes the PS4 $100 more expensive and the loss of sales wouldn't be offset by the interest in BC. I don't understand why people would argue for less features instead of more. Personally, I hope Sony adds it next gen. blind fangirlism.",,JohnWall32,United States of America,,,Negative,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

173496645748,5/1/2018,http://yourvideogamenews.tumblr.com/post/173496645748,"PlayStation Now, Sony’s streaming cloud-based gaming service, has added select PlayStation 2 games to its repertoire.

The addition of PS2 games was announced today, confirming that these are similar to the buy-and-download PS2 Classics already on PlayStation 4, which feature updated resolution and trophy support. So fans that want to replay the games by going for every trophy can do so without downloading.

The games added this week are Ape Escape 2, the ape-capturing Sony adventure-platformer; Dark Cloud 2, Level-5’s more Zelda-like follow up to the PS2 launch game; and Hot Shots Tennis, the tennis spinoff of the popular Hot Shots Golf series. 

As with other PSNow games, save data can be saved locally or uploaded to the cloud and downloaded on other systems.

[Source: PSBlog]

Our Take
I think Sony sees PSNow as a venue to address backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 4, but that’s a bit of a struggle with how many great games are on the PS2. I wonder if this allows them to increase the pace at which PS2 games come to the service.",,yourvideogamenews,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Tumblr,,,,,PlayStation 2 Games Join PlayStation Now,Post,,

173519840453,5/2/2018,http://avidbutaveragegaming.tumblr.com/post/173519840453,"On paper, the PlayStation Now service should be one of the forefronts of Sony’s sub-services next to Vue and the actual online service itself. For something that has been around essentially since the PS4′s release; outside of the monthly game updates, there is nothing else given. No improvements to the latency which can be disastrous even with an amazing/direct connection. Frame rates can drop and stay down like Big Sean. A lot of the older games look older, and I’m not asking for fully remastered visuals here. That said when you compile the older graphics with the janky frame rate and the fact that the visuals can even decrease at times really ruins the whole experience. Input lag is something that doesn’t happen often for me, but it does happen which means there are probably a decent handful of gamers that get it worse than I do. I’ve watched youtube videos of many complaints involving input lag so it’s clearly not just a specific issue. No maintenance is being done at all and now the games they are adding have started to slip in. The service was released in July of 2014. Sony, what in god’s name are you waiting for? For 20 dollars a month, the addition of games is good and some of the bigger titles really are great. I can’t, however, let go of how poor the overall service itself is. Especially when I look over at Game Pass.

Xbox’s Game Pass came out in May of 2017 and it is a vastly superior service that goes above and beyond the call in its purposes and functions. Instantly remastered classics that performs head and shoulders over PSnow.  “Remastered” may be the wrong term unless you have a One X, but the overall smoothness and frame rate is vastly superior. To the point where you can play new games on it with little to no trouble at all. It’s clear Microsoft took notes on where the PSNow service was falling short and capitalized on every weakness it had. Here we are a year later and Game Pass is a massive success while few people have even heard of PSNow despite it being out for four whole years now. Gaming journalists that laud the Game Pass admit they have either never heard of the service or it was mentioned in passing. Something that Sony should be taking very personally given that they originated the service Microsoft is being hailed for. The problem was, they didn’t perfect it, Microsoft did. If, and this is a big if, Microsoft are gonna deliver this E3 then it might be something to compile how stellar the online service is going. If nothing else hopefully they’ll have some games to put on that service, beyond the great classics. ",,avidbutaveragegaming,United States of America,,,Negative,Anger,Tumblr,,,,,The PlayStation Now Problem,Post,,

Moving all those classics to psnow, would get me to subscribe. Something to think about sony. @psobro You're paying $X per month to stream games with that service though.

It’ll be great to have all the Street Fighter games (epecially Alpha 2) on a console that I actually use. Believe it or not, this is the first time the PC has had anything better than a dos port of these games (or anything at all!) Ok,there are emulators, but those things are so clunky and crash-prone that I don’t even bother. Dark Souls Remastered - Because Souls. And GSilver is addicted to Soulsgames. The plan here is day-one Steam purchase (since it’s half off for owners of the original port) and I’ll pick up the Switch version if it goes on sale around the time I’m planning on a long trip. Spyro Collection - I dunno if I want to get it on the PS4, Xbox One, or wait a year+ for a PC version... I’ll probably get the console version if it runs at 60FPS on the PS4 Pro. But anyway, I liked Spyro 1 a lot back in the day, though I oddly didn’t finish 2 or 3. Overload - How could I not be hyped for the true successor to Descent? Mechwarrior 5 - I’ve wanted to get into the mechwarrior series for so long, and this one looks like it could be a ton of fun. I mechs. Budget Cuts - The full version of the best VR demo that I’ve played! I’m waiting for the reviews, but if it’s good, I *really* want to dive into this Freedom Planet 2 - What was my favorite game of 2014, and is one of my favorite games of all time? Hint: This one is the sequel. ...and there are lots of other games that I wouldn’t mind playing, but these are the only ones I’m geunuinely hyped for. ====================::==================== https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnow/ Doesn't that A) stream to PC and B) include TLOU?",,east1226,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,What games are you looking forward to?,,,

I imagine it's exactly like Playstation NOW and uses a lot of bandwidth in the process. I did a bit of looking around, and apparently it's the new name for GRID, which went into beta in 2013, but is now in beta again? And now also supports access to your own steam library. Not sure if it includes access to an additional library of GFN games. Basically, it's a rent-your-own-GRID-server thing, where you install your own games to play off a dedicated VM on some server somewhere. Like renting a PC, but less hassle, and more input latency. I can see this actually being pretty cool for people with fast internet connections, or who have access to high speed connections at, say, work, school, cafes, ect, especially the later. Bringing a macbook to work and playing your steam library during lunch sounds pretty great. No need for a high-end PC at home, or setting up a private server and jumping through all the hoops and troubleshooting of using a VPN with GameStream or Steam in-home streaming. Just connect to your Cloud server like any other streaming service, install your favorite games, and play. More reliable and better upload speeds, though I imagine the performance isn't exactly GTX1080 level. Probably more like 1050Ti. That said, I have no idea if that's how it is, that's just how it sounded in the wikiped article. definitely not a 1050ti. even though it only streams at 1080p 60, i changed the settings on the witcher 3 to 4k max settings and it still ran at about 80fps according to in game osd.",,jhood,United States of America,,,Neutral,Neutral,Forums,,,,,,,,

I'm now at a friends and want to see if the wifi connection is good enough to stream PSnow on my laptop. I've downloaded the app and installed but it won't start? I've restarted etc but it will not start. The icon is in my tray (and shows in task manager) but the app will not launch?

(playing on Psnow) Now I'm not looking for things that are remastered on PS4 already. So PS3 exclusives only! Currently I'm busy with my God of War marathon but It's going way faster as expected so I'm already on the look for some new games Currently I've got my eyes on Sly Cooper and marathon all those games. But any other titles that I should really look out for? No racing/fighting or Jrpg suggestions for the rest I'm very open minded ====================::==================== 3 minutes ago, Deluziion90 said: I'll keep an eye out I'm sure there were more but some have MP/Online and some have PS4 version which play better such as Metro Last Light. Since I don't see it on your profile I would heavily recommend the PS4 version of Metro Last Light since if you buy the disc it comes with the first game Metro 2033 Redux. They go on sale fairly often I believe too if you're fine with digital versions. I also only added what I have experience with.",,Avatar_Of_Battle,United States of America,,,Neutral,Anger,Forums,,,,,PS3 - Must play games,,,
